start="153.98" dur="4.68">to begin I&apos;m interested to know more</text><text start="156.5" dur="4.14">about you what were the conditions under</text><text start="158.66" dur="3.87">which you developed your mind as a young</text><text start="160.64" dur="2.25">person and how do you continue to do</text><text start="162.53" dur="2.76">that</text><text start="162.89" dur="5.01">even today fun question I think one of</text><text start="165.29" dur="5.88">the key defining things for me was I was</text><text start="167.9" dur="6.24">home-schooled throughout most of my</text><text start="171.17" dur="6.12">childhood and the reason for it was my</text><text start="174.14" dur="6.12">parents were educational philosophers</text><text start="177.29" dur="5.22">theorists and they had the idea that if</text><text start="180.26" dur="4.199">kids were given pretty much no</text><text start="182.51" dur="4.62">curriculum but exposed to as many things</text><text start="184.459" dur="4.981">as possible and then their interests</text><text start="187.13" dur="4.439">were facilitated that they would kind of</text><text start="189.44" dur="4.53">blossom in the unique way that they were</text><text start="191.569" dur="5.79">most innately suited to and so it was an</text><text start="193.97" dur="6.0">educational theory experiment and so I</text><text start="197.359" dur="4.831">had no curriculum at all never did hand</text><text start="199.97" dur="3.54">writing spelling state capitals and it</text><text start="202.19" dur="3.09">happens to be those three are good</text><text start="203.51" dur="4.41">examples of things that I never learned</text><text start="205.28" dur="4.2">well spell-checking later taught me how</text><text start="207.92" dur="3.51">to spell and make the fact that my</text><text start="209.48" dur="4.95">handwriting is illegible tolerable okay</text><text start="211.43" dur="5.7">and don&apos;t have state capitals but I was</text><text start="214.43" dur="4.35">fascinated by all of the sciences I&apos;m</text><text start="217.13" dur="4.47">fascinated by all the philosophic</text><text start="218.78" dur="5.1">disciplines and so I got to start</text><text start="221.6" dur="4.83">working in understanding modern physics</text><text start="223.88" dur="4.859">as a little bitty kid and eastern and</text><text start="226.43" dur="3.72">western schools of philosophy and etc</text><text start="228.739" dur="4.981">and one of the other cool things was not</text><text start="230.15" dur="4.98">having subject divisions I didn&apos;t know</text><text start="233.72" dur="3.75">there were subject divisions so there</text><text start="235.13" dur="3.72">was no arbitrary break between physics</text><text start="237.47" dur="4.38">and chemistry or chemistry and biology</text><text start="238.85" dur="4.5">or any of the disciplines so we&apos;d be as</text><text start="241.85" dur="4.56">a little kid it asked a question like</text><text start="243.35" dur="5.16">why is the sky blue and part of that</text><text start="246.41" dur="4.139">answer has to do with the physics of</text><text start="248.51" dur="3.449">diffraction and the molecule size the</text><text start="250.549" dur="4.44">upper atmosphere that means you have to</text><text start="251.959" dur="5.881">understand Sun and stars and solar</text><text start="254.989" dur="5.191">formation and atmospheric chemistry and</text><text start="257.84" dur="4.8">how diffraction works and the physics of</text><text start="260.18" dur="3.69">light waves and the actual molecules in</text><text start="262.64" dur="2.76">the other atmosphere but it also means</text><text start="263.87" dur="3.93">you have to understand how a retina work</text><text start="265.4" dur="4.14">and what&apos;s objective blue is and what is</text><text start="267.8" dur="3.45">the difference between subjective blue</text><text start="269.54" dur="3.659">and object of blue and then the hard</text><text start="271.25" dur="3.66">problem of neuroscience and like all of</text><text start="273.199" dur="5.131">that comes into her the answer that well</text><text start="274.91" dur="6.0">mm-hmm almost everything was a movement</text><text start="278.33" dur="4.11">between various Sciences and then</text><text start="280.91" dur="3.36">getting into the deep philosophy the</text><text start="282.44" dur="4.58">ground of the sciences or the hard</text><text start="284.27" dur="5.85">problems were and that led to a</text><text start="287.02" dur="5.14">interdisciplinary and system orientation</text><text start="290.12" dur="4.32">to understanding the nature of reality</text><text start="292.16" dur="3.75">that we live in and of course for me it</text><text start="294.44" dur="3.84">was always implicitly because</text><text start="295.91" dur="4.71">understanding early on evolutionary</text><text start="298.28" dur="5.55">theory universe was going somewhere and</text><text start="300.62" dur="5.79">it was organizing itself towards more</text><text start="303.83" dur="4.92">orderly complexity and with that more</text><text start="306.41" dur="5.039">complexity new emergent properties with</text><text start="308.75" dur="5.34">more evolved physiologies there were new</text><text start="311.449" dur="5.821">capacities of consciousness and so it&apos;s</text><text start="314.09" dur="6.12">clear that something like we have a role</text><text start="317.27" dur="6.149">to serve in participating with that</text><text start="320.21" dur="6.09">evolutionary impulse of universe as the</text><text start="323.419" dur="5.941">one creature here that we know has the</text><text start="326.3" dur="5.31">abstraction capacity with our certain</text><text start="329.36" dur="4.65">structures of prefrontal cortex to</text><text start="331.61" dur="4.8">understand evolution itself right to not</text><text start="334.01" dur="3.75">just be a part of the grand design but</text><text start="336.41" dur="2.7">be able to think about the whole thing</text><text start="337.76" dur="3.12">the direction of evolution of the</text><text start="339.11" dur="3.72">principles of it do we really have the</text><text start="340.88" dur="5.13">meaningful capacity to consciously</text><text start="342.83" dur="4.35">participate with it and looked like the</text><text start="346.01" dur="3.18">evolutionary impulse is evolving</text><text start="347.18" dur="4.29">everything all of universe so my</text><text start="349.19" dur="3.599">interest early was how do I understand</text><text start="351.47" dur="3.12">universe how do I understand where it&apos;s</text><text start="352.789" dur="3.421">going and how to help participate with</text><text start="354.59" dur="3.87">evolution of everything so that also</text><text start="356.21" dur="3.9">looked like activism in terms of how to</text><text start="358.46" dur="4.05">actually support the evolution of</text><text start="360.11" dur="4.71">quality of life for all sentient things</text><text start="362.51" dur="4.08">yeah and one thing I&apos;ll add because it&apos;s</text><text start="364.82" dur="3.33">so important for people to know is that</text><text start="366.59" dur="3.09">for the most part of the kids ask</text><text start="368.15" dur="3.449">questions that they&apos;re really interested</text><text start="369.68" dur="4.169">in like why is the sky blue and we don&apos;t</text><text start="371.599" dur="4.681">really understand the answer we don&apos;t</text><text start="373.849" dur="4.561">facilitate the interests well and then</text><text start="376.28" dur="3.54">we try to force them to be interested in</text><text start="378.41" dur="3.81">or at least do [ __ ] that they&apos;re really</text><text start="379.82" dur="4.17">not interested in at all and the process</text><text start="382.22" dur="3.18">of forcing them to do uninteresting</text><text start="383.99" dur="2.82">things while not the facilitating</text><text start="385.4" dur="3.15">interest is what breaks people&apos;s</text><text start="386.81" dur="3.93">interest in life and then you have to</text><text start="388.55" dur="3.63">extrinsic ly motivate them with money or</text><text start="390.74" dur="3.6">reward or whatever and otherwise they</text><text start="392.18" dur="5.789">want to chill and watch TV or play video</text><text start="394.34" dur="4.86">games but if intrinsic fascination with</text><text start="397.969" dur="3.841">life gets fed and</text><text start="399.2" dur="3.36">silat ated than they are innately and</text><text start="401.81" dur="3.66">ongoingly</text><text start="402.56" dur="5.22">highly agentic by nature your background</text><text start="405.47" dur="4.59">is particularly interesting to me we are</text><text start="407.78" dur="4.98">seriously considering homeschooling our</text><text start="410.06" dur="5.64">four-year-old boy hearing you explain</text><text start="412.76" dur="4.95">your background is motivating to me and</text><text start="415.7" dur="4.14">that this is indeed a good course to</text><text start="417.71" dur="4.02">pursue I was a solid student growing up</text><text start="419.84" dur="3.24">but I became a much better student later</text><text start="421.73" dur="2.67">when I found myself in learning</text><text start="423.08" dur="3.18">environments where I had more freedom to</text><text start="424.4" dur="3.33">do things like for example spend long</text><text start="426.26" dur="4.2">periods of time on a subject versus</text><text start="427.73" dur="4.59">changing my focus every 50 minutes like</text><text start="430.46" dur="3.96">you do at most schools so for me</text><text start="432.32" dur="4.2">changing class that frequently was</text><text start="434.42" dur="3.81">really disruptive I&apos;m more of a type of</text><text start="436.52" dur="3.18">a learner where I like to go deep I</text><text start="438.23" dur="3.72">built momentum and then I want to stick</text><text start="439.7" dur="4.23">with a subject for a while and then also</text><text start="441.95" dur="3.78">whatever typically has my attention has</text><text start="443.93" dur="3.24">all of it so I would do very well in</text><text start="445.73" dur="2.94">some classes and just okay and others</text><text start="447.17" dur="4.35">also the more I advanced my own</text><text start="448.67" dur="6.72">education I had the freedom to learn</text><text start="451.52" dur="5.04">more about how I learned and if I knew</text><text start="455.39" dur="3.66">some of these things earlier in life my</text><text start="456.56" dur="3.87">ability to advance my own knowledge with</text><text start="459.05" dur="3.33">the effort I was putting in I think</text><text start="460.43" dur="3.72">would have been greatly accelerated so</text><text start="462.38" dur="3.27">for my boy Desmond I think about how to</text><text start="464.15" dur="3.33">create this custom learning experience</text><text start="465.65" dur="4.08">that adaptively contours to his</text><text start="467.48" dur="4.23">interests a way to always harness that</text><text start="469.73" dur="3.57">natural curiosity that we have as</text><text start="471.71" dur="3.78">children and to empower that love of</text><text start="473.3" dur="4.02">learning by all means necessary so it&apos;s</text><text start="475.49" dur="3.66">really nice to hear about your</text><text start="477.32" dur="3.93">experience and that you look back on it</text><text start="479.15" dur="5.19">with appreciation I think about this</text><text start="481.25" dur="5.49">technologic unemployment is going to in</text><text start="484.34" dur="4.8">something like 30 percent of all jobs in</text><text start="486.74" dur="4.74">the next 15 years mm-hmm it&apos;s going to</text><text start="489.14" dur="4.65">start with a lot of labour jobs but it&apos;s</text><text start="491.48" dur="4.5">going to move with a eye to a lot of non</text><text start="493.79" dur="5.43">labor jobs when we think about the</text><text start="495.98" dur="4.8">history of education if a kid was gonna</text><text start="499.22" dur="2.22">grow up and take over the family</text><text start="500.78" dur="2.79">business</text><text start="501.44" dur="3.63">or the family work whatever that was so</text><text start="503.57" dur="3.39">they had to kind of learn how to do</text><text start="505.07" dur="4.46">those things from a skill location point</text><text start="506.96" dur="4.71">of view or then it became more</text><text start="509.53" dur="4.83">infrastructure alized and they were</text><text start="511.67" dur="4.86">going to just get some job within</text><text start="514.36" dur="3.76">infrastructure within my pre-cana me</text><text start="516.53" dur="3.12">they had to be prepared for the</text><text start="518.12" dur="3.75">workforce the workforce is gonna get</text><text start="519.65" dur="4.17">progressively more and more automated by</text><text start="521.87" dur="3.27">the time that people who are kids now</text><text start="523.82" dur="3.15">will be moving into what we would have</text><text start="525.14" dur="4.05">called the workforce previously mm-hmm</text><text start="526.97" dur="4.47">and what will be unique is things that</text><text start="529.19" dur="3.22">are uniquely human and so if there are</text><text start="531.44" dur="3.04">things that robot</text><text start="532.41" dur="3.51">can learn to do well in AI can learn to</text><text start="534.48" dur="3.27">do well and obviously there&apos;s a deep</text><text start="535.92" dur="4.71">question around strong AI but let&apos;s just</text><text start="537.75" dur="4.44">take strong AI off announce the things</text><text start="540.63" dur="3.36">that are uniquely human are going to be</text><text start="542.19" dur="3.33">the only things that really adaptive for</text><text start="543.99" dur="2.82">few minutes to do they also happen to be</text><text start="545.52" dur="2.91">the things that are most fascinating and</text><text start="546.81" dur="3.21">fun and intrinsically rewarding for</text><text start="548.43" dur="3.57">humans to do so this has always been a</text><text start="550.02" dur="3.84">relevant conversation yeah but it is</text><text start="552.0" dur="5.49">living in a way that it never has been</text><text start="553.86" dur="5.73">right so these are some big global</text><text start="557.49" dur="3.45">issues that we are facing how it&apos;s all</text><text start="559.59" dur="4.14">going to play out is you have to be told</text><text start="560.94" dur="4.89">but what I&apos;m hearing is that the need to</text><text start="563.73" dur="5.01">be able to maximize some of our innate</text><text start="565.83" dur="4.74">human capabilities is of paramount</text><text start="568.74" dur="3.36">importance for the next generation and</text><text start="570.57" dur="3.48">even for people that are going to go</text><text start="572.1" dur="3.6">through this transition when you think</text><text start="574.05" dur="3.54">about a cognitive enhancer which is</text><text start="575.7" dur="2.79">ostensibly at the topic of today you</text><text start="577.59" dur="3.54">think about something that might make</text><text start="578.49" dur="4.68">you focus better remember more be able</text><text start="581.13" dur="4.08">to task switch better but if you remove</text><text start="583.17" dur="4.38">a layer from there and you think this is</text><text start="585.21" dur="4.08">far more important for overall humanity</text><text start="587.55" dur="4.74">it&apos;s for us to be able to figure out</text><text start="589.29" dur="5.43">ways to optimize our minds ability to</text><text start="592.29"

dur="3.36">that didn&apos;t have adequate solutions I</text><text start="671.339" dur="2.55">was gonna have to figure it out and I</text><text start="672.809" dur="2.491">knew that was going to take

is on increasing cognitive</text><text start="680.55" dur="4.38">bandwidth then use that to figure out</text><text start="682.499" dur="3.81">the underlying pathophysiology etc</text><text start="684.93" dur="4.17">what&apos;s going on and corrected and then</text><text start="686.309" dur="4.77">get back to work and so that led to a</text><text start="689.1" dur="3.75">very deep dive in the whole topic of</text><text start="691.079" dur="4.56">cognitive chemistry and this was Rob&apos;s</text><text start="692.85" dur="5.609">brain nutrients at robux understanding</text><text start="695.639" dur="5.461">neurotransmission optimization etc so as</text><text start="698.459" dur="4.86">I was diving deep into that space and</text><text start="701.1" dur="4.469">looking at what&apos;s been done well and</text><text start="703.319" dur="3.87">we&apos;re there pretty significant polls one</text><text start="705.569" dur="3.33">of the big holes that I&apos;m always wanting</text><text start="707.189" dur="3.57">to look at is the topic of synthesis</text><text start="708.899" dur="4.081">where do we have a lot of knowledge of</text><text start="710.759" dur="4.711">acetylcholine goal or dopamine role or</text><text start="712.98" dur="4.349">glutamate role or neurotrophins role but</text><text start="715.47" dur="4.65">not the complex relationship between</text><text start="717.329" dur="4.5">those or even between different aspects</text><text start="720.12" dur="5.61">of the regulatory system on any of them</text><text start="721.829" dur="6.541">and so looking at how do we support many</text><text start="725.73" dur="4.74">complex systems that are self-regulating</text><text start="728.37" dur="4.17">to have increased regulatory capacity</text><text start="730.47" dur="3.959">became the deep question for me so</text><text start="732.54" dur="3.779">synthesis there that led to me doing</text><text start="734.429" dur="3.871">work on myself where I was able to</text><text start="736.319" dur="3.841">achieve increased cognitive bandwidth to</text><text start="738.3" dur="2.969">beyond what my previous healthy baseline</text><text start="740.16" dur="4.71">had been even while I had</text><text start="741.269" dur="5.43">pathophysiology going on and then was</text><text start="744.87" dur="3.569">able to figure out underlying cause what</text><text start="746.699" dur="3.661">was going on for me corrective reverse</text><text start="748.439" dur="4.531">autoimmune antibodies that whole fun</text><text start="750.36" dur="4.05">thing that led to doing that with quite</text><text start="752.97" dur="3.239">a few other people that had various</text><text start="754.41" dur="3.929">forms of disease that didn&apos;t have</text><text start="756.209" dur="5.37">adequate solution and clinical settings</text><text start="758.339" dur="5.881">and to formalizing a model of how health</text><text start="761.579" dur="4.591">aging illness and reversal of illness</text><text start="764.22" dur="4.26">could work there was a complex systems</text><text start="766.17" dur="5.579">informed model for medicine and</text><text start="768.48" dur="5.849">well-being and so that really was a lot</text><text start="771.749" dur="4.411">of things that that would pertain to but</text><text start="774.329" dur="3.6">the psycho neuropharmacology the</text><text start="776.16" dur="3.39">cognitive psychological stuff was really</text><text start="777.929" dur="3.991">essential because almost everyone who is</text><text start="779.55" dur="4.68">dealing with complex illness has some</text><text start="781.92" dur="4.349">brain fog cognitive effects and has some</text><text start="784.23" dur="5.19">emotion affected by hearing that they&apos;ve</text><text start="786.269" dur="5.01">got incurable prognosis and they have to</text><text start="789.42" dur="3.24">have their psyche and their cognition in</text><text start="791.279" dur="3.66">the right place to do everything that it</text><text start="792.66" dur="4.83">takes to get better right so focusing on</text><text start="794.939" dur="4.761">that first became a central thing so I</text><text start="797.49" dur="5.03">would say that&apos;s where I went from</text><text start="799.7" dur="5.34">being a area of general interest to a</text><text start="802.52" dur="4.77">area of central deep-dive mm-hmm yeah so</text><text start="805.04" dur="4.68">what I&apos;m hearing is there was a need</text><text start="807.29" dur="5.07">that arose for you personally that</text><text start="809.72" dur="4.68">fostered a deep dive to understand the</text><text start="812.36" dur="3.72">overall system with which any possible</text><text start="814.4" dur="5.4">solution would be working over your</text><text start="816.08" dur="5.1">health aging etc from there then you</text><text start="819.8" dur="3.54">wanted to understand not only how we</text><text start="821.18" dur="4.89">might be able to utilize some sort of</text><text start="823.34" dur="4.89">exogenous chemical to amplify a process</text><text start="826.07" dur="4.49">but rather how can we help make the</text><text start="828.23" dur="5.19">entire mind that is doing the thinking</text><text start="830.56" dur="4.66">stronger and better over time it seemed</text><text start="833.42" dur="3.96">like that was the goal yes and then</text><text start="835.22" dur="4.29">you&apos;ve been working to solve that yeah</text><text start="837.38" dur="4.62">the last thing that you said I think is</text><text start="839.51" dur="4.59">absolutely central to what our goal as</text><text start="842.0" dur="4.35">an organization is is that when we think</text><text start="844.1" dur="4.92">of psychopharmacology as a field or</text><text start="846.35" dur="4.47">really just pharmacology as a field</text><text start="849.02" dur="4.02">there are exceptions and they don&apos;t mean</text><text start="850.82" dur="4.71">to over generalize but generally there</text><text start="853.04" dur="4.65">is less focus on fundamental or</text><text start="855.53" dur="4.26">causation and especially if it is</text><text start="857.69" dur="4.08">multifactorial right like we focus on</text><text start="859.79" dur="3.75">cause and we&apos;re usually quite good in</text><text start="861.77" dur="4.62">western medicine if it&apos;s an acute cause</text><text start="863.54" dur="5.19">right injury or acute infection or acute</text><text start="866.39" dur="4.14">poisoning is quite obvious right and so</text><text start="868.73" dur="3.27">then you reverse that acute cause but if</text><text start="870.53" dur="3.21">the cause is time-delayed</text><text start="872.0" dur="3.6">so it&apos;s hard to find out what it was or</text><text start="873.74" dur="3.96">it&apos;s multifactorial there are multiple</text><text start="875.6" dur="4.08">things that are involved independently</text><text start="877.7" dur="4.2">or multiple sequence steps there&apos;s a</text><text start="879.68" dur="4.05">causal cascade it&apos;s hard to actually</text><text start="881.9" dur="5.49">understand what it is and so we&apos;ll</text><text start="883.73" dur="6.6">cluster symptoms into disease names but</text><text start="887.39" dur="5.1">if we look at what was the path of the</text><text start="890.33" dur="6.0">deviation from homeostasis that led to</text><text start="892.49" dur="5.82">this person&apos;s MS or cancer or rheumatism</text><text start="896.33" dur="3.9">a hundred different MSS have a hundred</text><text start="898.31" dur="3.66">different paths of ideologies right and</text><text start="900.23" dur="3.39">there are commonalities and then but</text><text start="901.97" dur="3.9">this is why personalized medicine is so</text><text start="903.62" dur="3.66">critical so generally given the</text><text start="905.87" dur="4.29">understanding cause has been difficult</text><text start="907.28" dur="4.68">the focus has largely not been on what&apos;s</text><text start="910.16" dur="3.18">actually in balance and how do we</text><text start="911.96" dur="2.73">correct it because it&apos;s not a small</text><text start="913.34" dur="3.33">number of things right it&apos;s usually a</text><text start="914.69" dur="4.38">large number of things right the focus</text><text start="916.67" dur="4.86">has largely been is there some kind of</text><text start="919.07" dur="4.5">exhaustion ischemic or treatment that we</text><text start="921.53" dur="4.67">can give that will limit the symptom</text><text start="923.57" dur="4.71">ology or some aspect of pathogenesis and</text><text start="926.2" dur="3.88">we&apos;ve that&apos;s better than not doing</text><text start="928.28" dur="3.78">anything but we can take the next step</text><text start="930.08" dur="3.21">in our science etc is good enough to</text><text start="932.06" dur="3.899">take the next step into our</text><text start="933.29" dur="4.89">focuses rather than give some exogenous</text><text start="935.959" dur="4.231">external override to an internal</text><text start="938.18" dur="3.54">regulatory system that is radically</text><text start="940.19" dur="3.72">complex and intelligent and brilliant</text><text start="941.72" dur="4.039">let&apos;s work to understand what&apos;s actually</text><text start="943.91" dur="4.47">wrong with the regulatory systems or</text><text start="945.759" dur="5.14">deficient in them and up regulate the</text><text start="948.38" dur="5.37">regulatory capacity of the system so</text><text start="950.899" dur="5.821">it&apos;s fundamentally more adaptive more</text><text start="953.75" dur="4.8">resilient etc I&apos;ve done research in the</text><text start="956.72" dur="4.47">condition of narcolepsy for over 10</text><text start="958.55" dur="3.81">years now gosh maybe 15 and I have an</text><text start="961.19" dur="3.389">example that&apos;s relevant to what we&apos;re</text><text start="962.36" dur="4.2">talking about narcoleptics are missing a</text><text start="964.579" dur="4.471">protein in their brain called hypocretin</text><text start="966.56" dur="5.85">one result of that pathology is</text><text start="969.05" dur="5.87">excessive daytime sleepiness which is</text><text start="972.41" dur="4.799">what usually is synonymous with the word</text><text start="974.92" dur="5.32">narcolepsy for most people but another</text><text start="977.209" dur="5.281">symptom is called cataplexy which is the</text><text start="980.24" dur="4.409">loss of muscle tone or partial paralysis</text><text start="982.49" dur="4.32">when somebody experiences emotion</text><text start="984.649" dur="4.62">usually so Daniel you tell me a joke and</text><text start="986.81" dur="4.769">I experienced weakness in my limbs and</text><text start="989.269" dur="4.171">in fact it might be where the term weak</text><text start="991.579" dur="3.45">from laughter comes from narcoleptics</text><text start="993.44" dur="2.85">also experience depression with greater</text><text start="995.029" dur="3.661">frequency than the rest of the</text><text start="996.29" dur="4.08">population so early on in the treatment</text><text start="998.69" dur="3.3">of this condition narcoleptics were</text><text start="1000.37" dur="3.3">given a class of drugs called tricyclic</text><text start="1001.99" dur="3.329">antidepressants turns out that this</text><text start="1003.67" dur="2.88">medication also improves patient&apos;s</text><text start="1005.319" dur="3.151">cataplexy which was totally</text><text start="1006.55" dur="3.69">serendipitous but the medication is not</text><text start="1008.47" dur="3.989">directly confronting the cause of</text><text start="1010.24" dur="3.39">narcolepsy but rather it is ameliorating</text><text start="1012.459" dur="3.69">one of the symptoms but only temporarily</text><text start="1013.63" dur="3.899">so here&apos;s the problem tricyclics do</text><text start="1016.149" dur="3.12">reduce cataplectic attacks in these</text><text start="1017.529" dur="3.81">patients but the medication loses its</text><text start="1019.269" dur="3.331">potency over time over the course of</text><text start="1021.339" dur="3.87">several months patient will build up</text><text start="1022.6" dur="4.26">tolerance to the drug and they will take</text><text start="1025.209" dur="3.571">what&apos;s called the drug holiday to allow</text><text start="1026.86" dur="3.839">the receptors to

start="1032.709" dur="2.97">are essentially paralyzed for days at a</text><text start="1035.11" dur="2.76">time</text><text start="1035.679" dur="4.77">and where they&apos;re having up to 60</text><text start="1037.87" dur="3.99">cataplectic attacks per day so they</text><text start="1040.449" dur="3.931">basically have to stay in bed until the</text><text start="1041.86" dur="3.959">brain resented eise&apos;s and readjusts in</text><text start="1044.38" dur="4.35">some conditions that&apos;s the best we can</text><text start="1045.819" dur="4.951">do but it does

dur="4.851">take narcolepsy for instance what is the</text><text start="1059.59" dur="6.06">cause of narcolepsy well it probably has</text><text start="1062.52" dur="4.24">quite a few distinct causes

start="1466.0" dur="3.53">testimonial for you</text><text start="1467.64" dur="4.74">a couple things on that first two</text><text start="1469.53" dur="6.27">disclaimers on our side one is not a</text><text start="1472.38" dur="5.34">drug right and treat anything and it&apos;s</text><text start="1475.8" dur="5.63">not prescribed for any diagnosed things</text><text start="1477.72" dur="6.48">etc this is a supplement without FDA</text><text start="1481.43" dur="5.83">classification or any drug stuff second</text><text start="1484.2" dur="5.22">thing is that we are absolutely not</text><text start="1487.26" dur="4.8">recommending it as a way to deal with</text><text start="1489.42" dur="5.28">lack of sleep as far as general</text><text start="1492.06" dur="5.19">lifestyle optimization goes exercise</text><text start="1494.7" dur="4.56">matters Food Matters mindset matters</text><text start="1497.25" dur="3.96">being outdoors matters there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="1499.26" dur="3.87">things that matter we probably put sleep</text><text start="1501.21" dur="4.05">in its own category and everything else</text><text start="1503.13" dur="3.78">in the second category in terms of just</text><text start="1505.26" dur="4.17">how important it is for overall</text><text start="1506.91" dur="4.92">physiology or there and one of the</text><text start="1509.43" dur="3.84">things that we push heavily is to really</text><text start="1511.83" dur="4.49">support people getting enough and good</text><text start="1513.27" dur="5.67">quality sleep and that Galia works</text><text start="1516.32" dur="4.06">radically better in well-rested people</text><text start="1518.94" dur="3.75">than in people that are dealing with</text><text start="1520.38" dur="4.08">some sleep deficit so just that public</text><text start="1522.69" dur="3.78">service announcement yep and I agree</text><text start="1524.46" dur="3.99">with that fully as a sleep researcher</text><text start="1526.47" dur="4.68">there is nothing that&apos;s been identified</text><text start="1528.45" dur="4.29">that replaces the need for sleep what I</text><text start="1531.15" dur="4.26">would say is that I think I perform</text><text start="1532.74" dur="5.31">better but that does not encourage me in</text><text start="1535.41" dur="4.98">any way to then cheat sleep there is a</text><text start="1538.05" dur="3.9">exponential benefit to getting better</text><text start="1540.39" dur="3.21">sleep and then having quality in my</text><text start="1541.95" dur="4.82">system then getting not enough sleep on</text><text start="1543.6" dur="5.55">a regular basis if someone is getting</text><text start="1546.77" dur="4.57">insufficient amounts of sleep acutely</text><text start="1549.15" dur="4.68">rarely then we&apos;re gonna deal with that</text><text start="1551.34" dur="3.18">much better than chronic sleep deficit</text><text start="1553.83" dur="2.4">yeah</text><text start="1554.52" dur="4.02">even if we&apos;re only talking about an hour</text><text start="1556.23" dur="4.44">less than the person actually needs but</text><text start="1558.54" dur="4.14">over a period of time I can really start</text><text start="1560.67" dur="3.48">to have profound effects so yeah moving</text><text start="1562.68" dur="2.61">on to the effects you experience I&apos;m</text><text start="1564.15" dur="3.24">delayed because you said things that</text><text start="1565.29" dur="3.39">related to most of the goals we had in</text><text start="1567.39" dur="3.69">the development of this particular</text><text start="1568.68" dur="4.71">product so one thing that we said was</text><text start="1571.08" dur="5.04">essential to our focus was how do we</text><text start="1573.39" dur="5.49">regulate regulatory capacity rather than</text><text start="1576.12" dur="5.25">up regulate particular state right</text><text start="1578.88" dur="5.07">mm-hmm in a way then creates external</text><text start="1581.37" dur="4.59">dependence and so we saw how many people</text><text start="1583.95" dur="3.93">were using adderall not even on</text><text start="1585.96" dur="3.96">prescription for appropriate purposes</text><text start="1587.88" dur="4.17">but off-label as a way to get through</text><text start="1589.92" dur="5.1">midterms or finals or their tech startup</text><text start="1592.05" dur="5.18">or whatever and it&apos;s a dopamine agonist</text><text start="1595.02" dur="4.47">but it is one it&apos;s going to be</text><text start="1597.23" dur="3.5">flatlining your dopamine while you&apos;re on</text><text start="1599.49" dur="3.64">it as opposed to how</text><text start="1600.73" dur="3.87">your dopamine responsive your dopamine</text><text start="1603.13" dur="2.52">regulary system responsive to what&apos;s</text><text start="1604.6" dur="2.37">happening because we don&apos;t want the same</text><text start="1605.65" dur="2.85">dopamine levels all the time right or</text><text start="1606.97" dur="3.209">any neurotransmitter we want them to be</text><text start="1608.5" dur="3.72">responsive so our state can shift to be</text><text start="1610.179" dur="5.011">appropriate to the environment mm-hmm -</text><text start="1612.22" dur="6.03">it&apos;s affecting dopamine without paying</text><text start="1615.19" dur="5.19">attention to its relationship in healthy</text><text start="1618.25" dur="3.96">cognitive function to acetylcholine than</text><text start="1620.38" dur="3.48">to so many other transmitters and then</text><text start="1622.21" dur="4.23">aspects of transmission and post</text><text start="1623.86" dur="5.34">synaptic d1 d2 receptor sensitivity and</text><text start="1626.44" dur="6.0">etc so you end up getting imbalances and</text><text start="1629.2" dur="4.59">really key ratios and dynamics mm-hmm so</text><text start="1632.44" dur="4.02">that we&apos;ll end up looking like with</text><text start="1633.79" dur="4.44">increasing focus but not increasing key</text><text start="1636.46" dur="3.99">aspects of memory or even decreasing</text><text start="1638.23" dur="4.98">some of them or things decreasing things</text><text start="1640.45" dur="5.609">like empathy or presence right and then</text><text start="1643.21" dur="5.52">because you are getting in exitus</text><text start="1646.059" dur="3.87">override to a key in chain chemical it</text><text start="1648.73" dur="3.03">can create dependence and down</text><text start="1649.929" dur="4.051">regulations yeah so our goal was the</text><text start="1651.76" dur="4.62">exact opposite it was we know people</text><text start="1653.98" dur="3.51">weren&apos;t going to use something if they</text><text start="1656.38" dur="2.91">didn&apos;t feel it right away</text><text start="1657.49" dur="3.39">it would just fit in category with all</text><text start="1659.29" dur="4.47">their other vitamins and supplements so</text><text start="1660.88" dur="5.13">it hasn&apos;t produce the kinds of immediate</text><text start="1663.76" dur="4.23">effects that they were looking for but</text><text start="1666.01" dur="3.99">we wanted it in a way that would not</text><text start="1667.99" dur="4.11">produce long term down-regulation and</text><text start="1670.0" dur="5.669">that would ideally produce meaningful</text><text start="1672.1" dur="5.91">long-term upregulation well even in the</text><text start="1675.669" dur="4.351">short-term having a much wider scope of</text><text start="1678.01" dur="4.409">positive impact so can we increase focus</text><text start="1680.02" dur="4.08">and concentration and short-term memory</text><text start="1682.419" dur="4.681">and working memory long-term memory</text><text start="1684.1" dur="4.8">creativity analysis synthesis all at the</text><text start="1687.1" dur="4.47">same time and a lot of things that are</text><text start="1688.9" dur="4.62">actually almost opposite functions like</text><text start="1691.57" dur="4.17">the ability to stay very focused</text><text start="1693.52" dur="4.17">independent of environmental noise but</text><text start="1695.74" dur="3.51">then the ability to tasks which when one</text><text start="1697.69" dur="2.76">needs a tasks which are opposite kinds</text><text start="1699.25" dur="4.26">of functions but we really want them</text><text start="1700.45" dur="5.91">both mm-hmm the ability to have very</text><text start="1703.51" dur="3.9">high Drive but also to be able to let go</text><text start="1706.36" dur="2.43">of it and be empathetically</text><text start="1707.41" dur="4.08">interpersonally responsive when</text><text start="1708.79" dur="4.92">necessary mm-hmm analytic and synthetic</text><text start="1711.49" dur="4.2">and so our focus was can we do</text><text start="1713.71" dur="5.16">comprehensive brain chemistry in</text><text start="1715.69" dur="6.479">real-time that makes people that</text><text start="1718.87" dur="8.07">up-regulates comprehensive capacities</text><text start="1722.169" dur="6.481">that is also up regulating over the long</text><text start="1726.94" dur="4.29">term and so those those are the things</text><text start="1728.65" dur="5.34">that we saw and we have been quite happy</text><text start="1731.23" dur="3.39">with what&apos;s happened so far though one</text><text start="1733.99" dur="3.51">of their</text><text start="1734.62" dur="5.73">component to my feedback is that as you</text><text start="1737.5" dur="4.17">recommend you take qualia during the</text><text start="1740.35" dur="4.23">week and then you don&apos;t take it on the</text><text start="1741.67" dur="5.4">weekends I still feel very energetic I</text><text start="1744.58" dur="4.41">feel my brain is actually even smarter</text><text start="1747.07" dur="4.11">having taken it but not having to my</text><text start="1748.99" dur="4.14">system on a weekend so that would</text><text start="1751.18" dur="6.96">support what your end goal was here one</text><text start="1753.13" dur="7.86">thing I&apos;ll say about that is the the</text><text start="1758.14" dur="7.71">most addictive chemical that&apos;s in this</text><text start="1760.99" dur="6.81">stack is caffeine and that&apos;s a chemical</text><text start="1765.85" dur="4.17">whose addiction curve most people are</text><text start="1767.8" dur="3.99">pretty familiar with and it&apos;s pretty</text><text start="1770.02" dur="3.45">benign everyone metabolize is caffeine</text><text start="1771.79" dur="4.05">differently and some people can drink it</text><text start="1773.47" dur="3.72">daily for quite some time and then not</text><text start="1775.84" dur="3.63">drink it and be fine other people will</text><text start="1777.19" dur="4.619">get headaches and it does have a lot to</text><text start="1779.47" dur="4.89">do with caffeine metabolism which is</text><text start="1781.809" dur="4.861">genetic and other factors so what I&apos;d</text><text start="1784.36" dur="4.11">say is this has a relatively small</text><text start="1786.67" dur="3.9">amount of caffeine we have 90 milligrams</text><text start="1788.47" dur="5.1">but in the unique form where it&apos;s bound</text><text start="1790.57" dur="5.67">to an antioxidant the antioxidant from</text><text start="1793.57" dur="4.98">blueberry skins pterostilbene which has</text><text start="1796.24" dur="4.56">it basically be slow release so it feels</text><text start="1798.55" dur="4.11">like 30 milligrams when it kicks on</text><text start="1800.8" dur="3.509">which is very very subtle but then it</text><text start="1802.66" dur="3.3">lasts for quite some time so instead of</text><text start="1804.309" dur="4.291">getting a spike in a drop off you get a</text><text start="1805.96" dur="3.78">very subtle long-term effect yeah why</text><text start="1808.6"
