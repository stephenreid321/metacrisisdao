dur="7.55">Peter Phil for having me nice to see</text><text start="296.92" dur="8.03">everybody here this is I have been</text><text start="301.56" dur="5.98">adjacent to seeing the stoic emerge</text><text start="304.95" dur="3.88">obviously lots of people I respect been</text><text start="307.54" dur="4.38">on here this is my first one to actually</text><text start="308.83" dur="6.78">get to participate in myself my</text><text start="311.92" dur="5.7">understanding is that it&apos;s not sharing</text><text start="315.61" dur="3.57">things that we have kind of have a</text><text start="317.62" dur="2.67">decent sense of having figured out but</text><text start="319.18" dur="3.989">things that were kind of on the edge of</text><text start="320.29" dur="6.69">figuring out ourselves and so Peter you</text><text start="323.169" dur="5.701">had asked me what is a topic I&apos;m kind of</text><text start="326.98" dur="3.93">interested in and contemplating at the</text><text start="328.87" dur="5.43">moment I think you phrased it as the</text><text start="330.91" dur="6.99">road to a Damon but so yeah that&apos;s where</text><text start="334.3" dur="5.34">the converting Moloch from SIF to Jedi</text><text start="337.9" dur="4.65">was the first thought that came up or I</text><text start="339.64" dur="5.49">think I also said something like how to</text><text start="342.55" dur="4.86">close evolutionary niches for sociopathy</text><text start="345.13" dur="7.11">and predatory predatory expressions of</text><text start="347.41" dur="6.36">sociopathy this is definitely a primary</text><text start="352.24" dur="5.16">topic on my mind right now</text><text start="353.77" dur="6.36">I I&apos;m not sure if everybody on here is</text><text start="357.4" dur="5.67">familiar with the term Moloch used in</text><text start="360.13" dur="5.13">the way that like it was defined in</text><text start="363.07" dur="3.93">meditations on Moloch from slate start</text><text start="365.26" dur="3.42">codex I&apos;ve talked about it that way</text><text start="367.0" dur="7.79">other times if not all do a basic</text><text start="368.68" dur="13.02">definition anyone not familiar with it</text><text start="374.79" dur="11.82">okay before I just kind of dive in Peter</text><text start="381.7" dur="4.91">fill any thing else for context</text><text start="387.7" dur="6.18">not on my end what do you think Phil</text><text start="390.31" dur="6.59">yeah not am I and I think the good to</text><text start="393.88" dur="3.02">define Moloch</text><text start="397.2" dur="5.83">so Moloch is a if you haven&apos;t read it</text><text start="402.64" dur="2.94">yet</text><text start="403.03" dur="4.92">Google meditations on Moloch slates are</text><text start="405.58" dur="5.31">codex it&apos;s a brilliant beautiful article</text><text start="407.95" dur="5.37">it&apos;s describing multipolar traps but in</text><text start="410.89" dur="4.62">a way that gives both good grounded</text><text start="413.32" dur="4.29">examples and nice poetry to it and</text><text start="415.51" dur="3.6">multipolar trap basically is a game</text><text start="417.61" dur="6.12">theoretic situation where you have a</text><text start="419.11" dur="6.39">number of players where if any of them</text><text start="423.73" dur="4.02">defects it creates an incentive for</text><text start="425.5" dur="3.57">everybody else to defect defect on some</text><text start="427.75" dur="3.0">type of agreement that would actually</text><text start="429.07" dur="4.7">create a better global optimum for the</text><text start="430.75" dur="6.48">whole but each person&apos;s own local</text><text start="433.77" dur="4.63">optimum would have them defect on the</text><text start="437.23" dur="4.8">whole but then you get a race to the</text><text start="438.4" dur="5.97">bottom and in other words if anyone does</text><text start="442.03" dur="3.9">something that is kind of really bad for</text><text start="444.37" dur="3.42">the Commons and bad for the whole</text><text start="445.93" dur="4.02">long-term but provides a lot of</text><text start="447.79" dur="5.01">near-term advantage for them they just</text><text start="449.95" dur="4.92">win so everyone else then to not lose</text><text start="452.8" dur="6.3">has to race to do that thing faster and</text><text start="454.87" dur="5.91">an arms race is a classic example so if</text><text start="459.1" dur="3.96">anybody builds the new type of weapon</text><text start="460.78" dur="3.63">and anyone else says no that weapons</text><text start="463.06" dur="3.54">[ __ ] we shouldn&apos;t have chemical</text><text start="464.41" dur="4.17">weapons or biological weapons or AI</text><text start="466.6" dur="4.23">automated killing weapons and whoever</text><text start="468.58" dur="4.62">builds them just wins everything runs</text><text start="470.83" dur="4.5">the world so anybody builds a fucked-up</text><text start="473.2" dur="4.02">weapon and now everybody has to race to</text><text start="475.33" dur="3.93">build that weapon plus counter weapons</text><text start="477.22" dur="5.79">plus better versions of that weapon</text><text start="479.26" dur="6.21">faster so that&apos;s a kind of arms race</text><text start="483.01" dur="4.5">example tragedy of the Commons is</text><text start="485.47" dur="4.38">another kind of classic example anybody</text><text start="487.51" dur="4.17">does something that externalizes more of</text><text start="489.85" dur="4.53">the cost to the Commons they figure out</text><text start="491.68" dur="4.05">some mining method that maybe leaves a</text><text start="494.38" dur="3.54">lot more tailings or mountaintop removal</text><text start="495.73" dur="4.41">or whatever but it increases margins and</text><text start="497.92" dur="4.23">opens up new markets whoever does that</text><text start="500.14" dur="3.45">will economically beat out the ones who</text><text start="502.15" dur="3.48">aren&apos;t doing it so then everybody races</text><text start="503.59" dur="4.02">to do the more extractive polluting</text><text start="505.63" dur="4.56">externalizing thing and you&apos;re left with</text><text start="507.61" dur="4.11">no forests and no fish and toxic</text><text start="510.19" dur="3.6">tailings in the water and that kind of</text><text start="511.72" dur="4.29">thing so a race to the bottom there&apos;s a</text><text start="513.79" dur="4.38">simple way of thinking about it so a lot</text><text start="516.01" dur="3.93">of people when they think about what&apos;s</text><text start="518.17" dur="3.33">underneath all the problems in the</text><text start="519.94" dur="5.25">they start to think about social</text><text start="521.5" dur="5.97">architectures and so one of the social</text><text start="525.19" dur="4.83">architectures is this kind of game</text><text start="527.47" dur="7.37">theoretic race to the bottom type</text><text start="530.02" dur="7.53">scenario where a very small number of</text><text start="534.84" dur="4.72">sociopaths or sadists or [ __ ] can</text><text start="537.55" dur="4.41">create a game dynamic that then everyone</text><text start="539.56" dur="6.03">else has obligated to not just play but</text><text start="541.96" dur="9.12">try to play to win and we see this</text><text start="545.59" dur="8.49">actually playing out right like the UN</text><text start="551.08" dur="5.04">was created out of World War two to try</text><text start="554.08" dur="3.84">and prevent nuclear proliferation and</text><text start="556.12" dur="3.24">then has had the primary goal of nuclear</text><text start="557.92" dur="4.14">deep proliferation and we have way more</text><text start="559.36" dur="4.44">countries with way faster nukes now than</text><text start="562.06" dur="3.84">we did then it&apos;s like why have we failed</text><text start="563.8" dur="4.11">so profoundly at being able to get rid</text><text start="565.9" dur="6.84">of nukes because who wants to give up</text><text start="567.91" dur="7.26">their last nuke first like no nobody&apos;s</text><text start="572.74" dur="4.14">stupid and and how do we know if the</text><text start="575.17" dur="2.79">other guys actually gave up their last</text><text start="576.88" dur="2.01">nuke or if they&apos;re saying they gave up</text><text start="577.96" dur="5.28">their last nuke and they&apos;re just hiding</text><text start="578.89" dur="6.51">one and so it becomes very hard to share</text><text start="583.24" dur="4.08">the optics necessary to get the kind of</text><text start="585.4" dur="4.44">agreement so if we don&apos;t give up all the</text><text start="587.32" dur="5.16">nukes then we actually say ok we [ __ ] it</text><text start="589.84" dur="4.95">we&apos;ve got nukes I can actually win</text><text start="592.48" dur="3.96">mutually assured destruction if my nukes</text><text start="594.79" dur="3.54">are way faster and I can win first</text><text start="596.44" dur="4.05">strike so the entire Cold War was a race</text><text start="598.33" dur="4.77">between Soviet and US military</text><text start="600.49" dur="4.23">manufactured for hypersonic missiles to</text><text start="603.1" dur="5.13">see can we make faster and faster nukes</text><text start="604.72" dur="5.46">and right now the main one is there&apos;s</text><text start="608.23" dur="6.63">massive arms races and cyber weaponry</text><text start="610.18" dur="7.26">there&apos;s massive arms races in obviously</text><text start="614.86" dur="6.54">bio but AI is the really big one</text><text start="617.44" dur="7.71">autonomous weapons so how do we get out</text><text start="621.4" dur="5.25">of that is a big question and and we can</text><text start="625.15" dur="3.3">see a bunch of examples when we talk</text><text start="626.65" dur="6.41">about tragedy of the Commons it&apos;s not</text><text start="628.45" dur="7.92">just environmental Commons it&apos;s also</text><text start="633.06" dur="5.73">epistemic and emotional common some news</text><text start="636.37" dur="5.31">agency figures out how to use more</text><text start="638.79" dur="4.63">inflammatory salacious headlines that</text><text start="641.68" dur="3.33">hijack your limbic nervous system better</text><text start="643.42" dur="2.91">and more people just open that [ __ ]</text><text start="645.01" dur="3.75">because it actually worked and you&apos;re</text><text start="646.33" dur="3.99">like I want to know you know Trump</text><text start="648.76" dur="4.42">eviscerate somebody or whatever like the</text><text start="650.32" dur="5.44">words that that hit some</text><text start="653.18" dur="4.14">evolutionary

start="660.83" dur="5.52">into the shortest number of bullet</text><text start="662.21" dur="5.97">points and whatever and then it&apos;s not</text><text start="666.35" dur="4.32">just a race for who

dur="6.9">micro targets the most addictive ones to</text><text start="677.87" dur="4.32">you personally right so then this is</text><text start="679.55" dur="5.79">what Facebook and Google and Twitter and</text><text start="682.19" dur="4.28">the large platforms in competition with</text><text start="685.34" dur="3.66">each other are doing is actually</text><text start="686.47" dur="4.36">competing

because the</text><text start="711.77" dur="4.23">total number of things that you can see</text><text start="714.11" dur="3.24">in your Facebook feed represents a</text><text start="716.0"

a point at which it is made</text><text start="1023.57" dur="3.69">all the paper clips it can with its</text><text start="1024.98" dur="3.84">existing substrate and now it has to get</text><text

actually compete with the</text><text start="1033.38" dur="3.27">people that want to use that for other</text><text start="1035.089" dur="3.241">materials but it can out-compete them</text><text

start="1107.809" dur="6.301">of being able to take a single metric</text><text start="1111.41" dur="4.92">which is a dollar or a piece of fiat</text><text start="1114.11" dur="4.62">currency of whatever kind or currency of</text><text start="1116.33" dur="6.15">some kind and be able to incent some</text><text start="1118.73" dur="6.96">kinds of production of goods and</text><text start="1122.48" dur="7.68">services and but of course as soon as</text><text start="1125.69" dur="6.989">you understand that the interest on the</text><text start="1130.16" dur="4.139">monetary supply requires an exponential</text><text start="1132.679" dur="4.441">growth of the monetary supply and to not</text><text start="1134.299" dur="4.62">debase the monetary supply requires an</text><text

things you start to</text><text start="1143.419" dur="6.0">realize that capitalism as a whole is</text><text start="1147.02" dur="5.399">incenting an increased movement of</text><text start="1149.419" dur="4.861">turning everything into things that are</text><text start="1152.419" dur="3.721">measurable by dollars value that is</text><text start="1154.28" dur="3.92">metrical by dollars because let&apos;s say</text><text start="1156.14" dur="6.419">there&apos;s a kind of value like I</text><text start="1158.2" dur="6.46">appreciate the feeling of sunshine or I</text><text start="1162.559"

dur="5.19">extractable and exchangeable don&apos;t and</text><text start="1185.27" dur="6.3">so all types of value get oriented</text><text start="1188.54" dur="4.56">towards the ones that confer power so</text><text start="1191.57" dur="2.82">that&apos;s a paper clip Maximizer so we can</text><text start="1193.1" dur="2.85">and when you talk about getting</text><text start="1194.39" dur="5.37">recursively better you have a movement</text><text start="1195.95" dur="6.54">from barter to some type of currency to</text><text start="1199.76" dur="4.38">a fiat currency to fractional

everything that I&apos;m focused on is</text><text start="1266.879" dur="5.91">is how to kill Moloch which is the</text><text start="1271.32" dur="3.719">generator function of all those other</text><text start="1272.789" dur="4.32">things but you don&apos;t actually have to</text><text start="1275.039" dur="4.26">kill it right so this was this topic of</text><text start="1277.109" dur="4.89">being able to convert Moloch from the</text><text start="1279.299" dur="6.33">dark side to the light side which is can</text><text start="1281.999" dur="6.42">you actually it&apos;s a funny

dur="4.62">Darth Vader be you know doing the good</text><text start="1302.909" dur="4.801">act right at the very end so that&apos;s why</text><text start="1305.97" dur="5.789">I just I was thinking about is kind of a</text><text start="1307.71" dur="17.52">fun idea if we just just say that Moloch</text><text start="1311.759" dur="16.29">in essence is game theory it is some</text><text

each other where any</text><text start="1332.519" dur="6.14">innovation that any of them do leads to</text><text start="1335.94" dur="6.119">the other ones needing to innovate in a</text><text

can also be gradient ascend you can</text><text start="1346.71" dur="4.829">engineer races to the top where someone</text><text start="1349.44" dur="3.0">conduced something that is actually</text><text start="1351.539" dur="6.151">better for the</text><text start="1352.44" dur="8.1">long term and that actually creates</text><text start="1357.69" dur="5.85">near-term adaptive

dur="6.39">that are also following that similar</text><text start="1368.79" dur="6.36">trend so the question of how do you make</text><text start="1372.09" dur="6.24">things and so what one way we can think</text><text start="1375.15" dur="7.29">about Morlock also is the kind of</text><text start="1378.33" dur="5.55">near-term short-term schism of that what</text><text start="1382.44" dur="3.12">is

it</text><text start="1386.91" dur="2.82">because we don&apos;t have enough resource</text><text start="1388.08" dur="5.22">and that there are things that provide</text><text start="1389.73" dur="4.92">near-term benefit and this is like okay</text><text start="1393.3" dur="3.27">so I cut down the tree I get immediate</text><text start="1394.65" dur="4.59">material advantage from doing so

that doesn&apos;t increase my power to do</text><text start="1402.78" dur="4.68">or affect anything and thinking about it</text><text start="1406.11" dur="3.03">as an individual me cutting down

start="1596.23" dur="3.809">as a whole and then once he does that it</text><text start="1598.539" dur="2.731">becomes obvious that it&apos;s both a doable</text><text start="1600.039" dur="3.211">and a desirable thing and then all the</text><text start="1601.27" dur="3.75">other car manufacturers realize they</text><text start="1603.25" dur="3.919">become obsolete unless they also do it</text><text start="1605.02" dur="5.279">and now you have everybody racing to do</text><text start="1607.169" dur="5.14">electric cars better in a way that they</text><text start="1610.299"

something in actuation capacity</text><text start="1746.779" dur="3.841">could act on it well there&apos;s plenty of</text><text start="1749.27" dur="2.85">places where there are things that are</text><text start="1750.62" dur="3.51">bad for the world environmentally or</text><text start="1752.12" dur="4.65">whatever that are only barely profitable</text><text start="1754.13" dur="4.14">but at scale still profitable and we</text><text start="1756.77" dur="3.899">could make them more expensive through a</text><text start="1758.27" dur="4.019">number of means and there are things</text><text start="1760.669" dur="3.721">that are not quite profitable and this</text><text start="1762.289" dur="3.841">is kind of what Elon showed but if you</text><text start="1764.39" dur="3.269">could get economy of scale over a</text><text start="1766.13" dur="3.51">certain threshold or you change the</text><text start="1767.659" dur="4.231">narrative landscape to increase

dur="3.42">those things more profitable this is</text><text start="1776.69" dur="3.359">like not a new idea</text><text start="1778.01" dur="3.6">but the idea of being able to use the</text><text

do we change the topology of</text><text start="1799.37" dur="4.799">Finance writ large and so the idea of</text><text start="1802.429" dur="4.74">being able and the people that do that</text><text start="1804.169" dur="5.49">do it for almost exclusively personal</text><text start="1807.169" dur="5.461">gain extractive traditional Moloc</text><text start="1809.659" dur="5.851">purposes but those Moloc tools that can</text><text start="1812.63" dur="4.56">change the topology of markets in a way</text><text start="1815.51" dur="4.139">that then moves what everyone else is</text><text start="1817.19" dur="3.78">incentive to do can also be used to</text><text start="1819.649" dur="3.631">create races to the top where they</text><text start="1820.97" dur="3.81">aren&apos;t currently being implemented</text><text start="1823.28" dur="4.26">so I can give you an example when it</text><text start="1824.78" dur="3.51">comes to the Amazon if you want but I</text><text start="1827.54" dur="11.91">don&apos;t know if there are other questions</text><text start="1828.29" dur="14.72">first huh I would love to actually hear</text><text start="1839.45" dur="8.25">about the Amazon the one or maybe later</text><text start="1843.01" dur="6.64">if if people feel called I am really</text><text start="1847.7" dur="3.75">enjoying the fact that a lot of</text><text start="1849.65" dur="4.95">collective intelligence happening in the</text><text start="1851.45" dur="6.24">chat so if people want to hear that and</text><text start="1854.6" dur="5.64">it&apos;s not just my own personal interest</text><text start="1857.69" dur="4.29">in the Amazon then people can share that</text><text start="1860.24" dur="4.95">in the chat I do want to let people know</text><text start="1861.98" dur="4.86">that we have Daniel here until 8:30 in</text><text start="1865.19" dur="5.58">case people were wondering this is</text><text start="1866.84" dur="6.69">whether this was in power long I guess a</text><text start="1870.77" dur="5.58">session so just to get people some time</text><text start="1873.53" dur="7.05">heads up and I&apos;m really appreciating all</text><text start="1876.35" dur="6.42">the Plus Ones so it helps me choose I&apos;ll</text><text start="1880.58" dur="5.4">see what people are really interested in</text><text start="1882.77" dur="5.82">so I think the first question that I</text><text start="1885.98" dur="7.34">want to cut to the group will want to</text><text start="1888.59" dur="8.07">call on would be from Daniel Kazanjian</text><text start="1893.32" dur="6.82">hey I thinks Daniel I just have a</text><text start="1896.66" dur="6.06">question for grounding this discussion</text><text start="1900.14" dur="4.86">in a more personal way like I love</text><text start="1902.72" dur="4.11">hearing about how we can resolve things</text><text start="1905.0" dur="3.78">at a systemic level and obviously that</text><text start="1906.83" dur="4.74">discussion needs to be had but one</text><text start="1908.78" dur="5.52">takeaway that I hope to take is how I</text><text start="1911.57" dur="3.69">can take what you&apos;re saying and some of</text><text start="1914.3" dur="3.3">the thinking around the space and</text><text start="1915.26" dur="5.43">actually improve my relationships</text><text start="1917.6" dur="4.83">improves what&apos;s immediately at hand so</text><text start="1920.69" dur="4.8">do you have any personal ideas or</text><text start="1922.43" dur="5.58">examples for how this idea of moloch</text><text start="1925.49" dur="3.96">alchemy can apply really really locally</text><text start="1928.01" dur="3.69">like within your friendships or within</text><text start="1929.45" dur="4.49">your your marriages and family that kind</text><text start="1931.7" dur="2.24">of thing</text><text start="1940.74" dur="7.48">yes and no yes it can apply and you</text><text start="1946.69" dur="3.3">actually don&apos;t want your friendships and</text><text start="1948.22" dur="3.75">marriages to have game theory as their</text><text start="1949.99" dur="7.35">primary driver no matter what even a</text><text start="1951.97" dur="7.35">race to the top I don&apos;t want to be</text><text start="1957.34" dur="3.81">trying to out-compete my wife or who&apos;s</text><text start="1959.32" dur="2.91">nicer to each other like that&apos;s just the</text><text start="1961.15" dur="2.49">wrong [ __ ] headframe</text><text start="1962.23" dur="3.6">so what I&apos;m talking about with</text><text start="1963.64" dur="4.26">converting Moloch is insofar as there</text><text start="1965.83" dur="3.89">are competitive relationships there are</text><text start="1967.9" dur="5.85">relationships that have real kind of</text><text start="1969.72" dur="6.459">agency competition going on can we make</text><text start="1973.75" dur="4.47">races to the top but that doesn&apos;t mean</text><text start="1976.179" dur="4.801">that all action is game theory mediated</text><text start="1978.22" dur="4.829">the so when I&apos;m talking about converting</text><text start="1980.98" dur="4.59">Moloch that&apos;s actually not a game B idea</text><text start="1983.049" dur="4.951">it&apos;s a game a to game be transitional</text><text start="1985.57" dur="4.2">idea right game B idea is that anti</text><text start="1988.0" dur="4.95">rivalries relationships in which Moloch</text><text start="1989.77" dur="8.7">is not actually a thing the underlying</text><text start="1992.95" dur="8.94">kind of game theory so now if we say in</text><text start="1998.47" dur="5.64">your in your local environment are there</text><text start="2001.89" dur="3.93">plenty of rivalries relationships that</text><text start="2004.11" dur="5.22">can move in the right direction yeah</text><text start="2005.82" dur="6.3">like having a subculture define cool</text><text start="2009.33" dur="4.71">differently in a way that creates a</text><text start="2012.12" dur="9.6">gradient ascent is actually a really</text><text start="2014.04" dur="10.019">[ __ ] valuable thing

how</text><text start="3026.819" dur="3.901">there&apos;s a confluence of perverse</text><text start="3028.44" dur="3.96">incentive and asymmetry between the</text><text start="3030.72" dur="6.08">upside and downside kind of everywhere</text><text start="3032.4" dur="4.4">but it&apos;s important to understand that</text><text start="3037.52" dur="4.66">the psychologies that are in

now what</text><text start="3053.28" dur="5.809">types of tools do they use to be</text><text start="3055.44" dur="6.36">effective well you have financial</text><text start="3059.089" dur="4.571">institutions that have trillions of</text><text start="3061.8" dur="2.97">dollars or at least tens or hundreds of</text><text start="3063.66" dur="3.419">billions of dollars in assets

start="3075.23" dur="7.25">basically co-opt its sovereign law</text><text start="3079.49" dur="5.12">Greenpeace doesn&apos;t do that</text><text start="3082.48" dur="3.72">like the nonprofit&apos;s that are trying to</text><text start="3084.61" dur="2.76">protect the Amazon for the most part</text><text start="3086.2" dur="2.94">they aren&apos;t even trying to protect the</text><text start="3087.37" dur="4.86">Amazon the young activists in them are</text><text start="3089.14" dur="5.22">but the top of the NGOs the NGOs end up</text><text start="3092.23" dur="5.01">getting a lot of power some of the NGOs</text><text start="3094.36" dur="4.26">and this is actually an important thing</text><text start="3097.24" dur="4.79">to understand that I learned very much</text><text start="3098.62" dur="8.06">the hard way coming up in this space is</text><text start="3102.03" dur="7.24">if there&apos;s a problem and you incentivize</text><text start="3106.68" dur="4.18">what you make a company or an</text><text start="3109.27" dur="3.45">organization or a non-profit or a</text><text start="3110.86" dur="3.39">government agency to solve that problem</text><text start="3112.72" dur="2.91">and now the there are people who have</text><text start="3114.25" dur="2.97">salaries forever and they didn&apos;t have</text><text start="3115.63" dur="4.11">salaries before and they have access to</text><text start="3117.22" dur="3.75">power and prestige if you really solve</text><text start="3119.74" dur="2.43">that problem that whole thing would go</text><text start="3120.97" dur="2.49">out of business and all those people to</text><text start="3122.17" dur="3.15">lose all that stuff that was beneficial</text><text start="3123.46" dur="4.14">to them so they have an ongoing</text><text start="3125.32" dur="4.08">incentive to maintain the problem and</text><text start="3127.6" dur="3.51">maintain the legitimacy of them as a</text><text start="3129.4" dur="3.6">response to managing it so the</text><text start="3131.11" dur="3.36">incentives skewed towards managing</text><text start="3133.0" dur="3.72">problems forever rather than really</text><text start="3134.47" dur="4.44">solving or obsoleting them so you have</text><text start="3136.72" dur="3.87">to really pay attention to the incentive</text><text start="3138.91" dur="5.16">architectures underneath all of those</text><text start="3140.59" dur="5.31">things usually I can look at someone has</text><text start="3144.07" dur="3.36">a plan for how to fix the Amazon or the</text><text start="3145.9" dur="4.23">grid or nuclear disarmament I just have</text><text start="3147.43" dur="4.23">to look at the incentive landscape of</text><text start="3150.13" dur="3.21">the institutions and people that are</text><text start="3151.66" dur="8.28">involved and will usually have a pretty</text><text start="3153.34" dur="11.01">quick sense of where it fails so as a</text><text start="3159.94" dur="6.42">transition from game a to game B where</text><text start="3164.35" dur="6.21">we are in the presence of ubiquitous</text><text start="3166.36" dur="5.73">rivalry that is both empowered with very</text><text start="3170.56" dur="4.94">high level national and private</text><text start="3172.09" dur="5.7">intelligence and the top level financial</text><text start="3175.5" dur="6.7">capabilities and private militias and</text><text start="3177.79" dur="7.32">all that [ __ ] we don&apos;t get to gain B if</text><text start="3182.2" dur="4.23">we lose comprehensively in the game</text><text start="3185.11" dur="4.14">anything right now so this is this</text><text start="3186.43" dur="6.21">question we&apos;ve asked before of if the</text><text start="3189.25" dur="6.33">peaceful cultures always get killed by</text><text start="3192.64" dur="4.11">the warring cultures and if they don&apos;t</text><text start="3195.58" dur="2.64">get killed at the warring cultures</text><text start="3196.75" dur="2.97">because they get better at war which</text><text start="3198.22" dur="4.38">makes them no longer peaceful cultures</text><text start="3199.72" dur="5.16">that&apos;s another way to describe Moloc how</text><text start="3202.6" dur="4.14">do you have peaceful cultures that don&apos;t</text><text start="3204.88" dur="4.98">get killed by the warring cultures or</text><text start="3206.74" dur="7.04">get converted into them is another key</text><text start="3209.86" dur="6.36">way to kind of think about this and</text><text start="3213.78" dur="5.319">another way to think about it is what is</text><text start="3216.22" dur="8.7">legitimate power versus illegitimate</text><text start="3219.099" dur="9.031">power and one way of defining that one</text><text start="3224.92" dur="6.179">way I define it is so let&apos;s say we have</text><text start="3228.13" dur="5.82">a power law distribution of power if I</text><text start="3231.099" dur="6.211">start to gain more power in that so I</text><text start="3233.95" dur="5.61">have 10x the money of average people or</text><text start="3237.31" dur="7.71">100x or whatever it is or visibility or</text><text start="3239.56" dur="8.97">something I&apos;m benefiting from that I can</text><text start="3245.02" dur="5.339">pay gardeners and maids and people to</text><text start="3248.53" dur="2.4">come do [ __ ] for me at less than I make</text><text start="3250.359" dur="2.371">per hour</text><text start="3250.93" dur="4.23">like I&apos;m really benefiting from that</text><text start="3252.73" dur="4.2">power asymmetry and if those people who</text><text start="3255.16" dur="4.11">charge that rate charge the same thing I</text><text start="3256.93" dur="4.679">charge I wouldn&apos;t be able to do it so</text><text start="3259.27" dur="3.99">I&apos;m maximally incentive to maintain that</text><text start="3261.609" dur="3.121">power asymmetry and grow it so it goes</text><text start="3263.26" dur="4.41">from maids and gardeners to yacht</text><text start="3264.73" dur="6.9">repairers and whatever else right and so</text><text start="3267.67" dur="6.33">typically if anyone has an asymmetry of</text><text start="3271.63" dur="4.65">power they have both an incentive and</text><text start="3274.0" dur="3.42">the capability to grow they&apos;re a cemetry</text><text start="3276.28" dur="2.819">of power they have the capability</text><text start="3277.42" dur="4.14">because they have more power right and</text><text start="3279.099" dur="6.061">they have the incentive so I would say</text><text start="3281.56" dur="6.6">illage illegitimate power is doing that</text><text start="3285.16" dur="5.3">is utilizing asymmetric power to</text><text start="3288.16" dur="4.8">maintain and grow the asymmetry of power</text><text start="3290.46" dur="4.48">which then has other groups that are</text><text start="3292.96" dur="3.24">most everyone else isn&apos;t capable so you</text><text start="3294.94" dur="2.85">have the separation of the haves and the</text><text start="3296.2" dur="3.06">have-nots and the haves or the other</text><text start="3297.79" dur="4.53">ones who have power written the arms</text><text start="3299.26" dur="4.53">races with each other and competitions</text><text start="3302.32" dur="3.15">for controlling the minds of everyone</text><text start="3303.79" dur="5.88">else so they vote in purchase in the</text><text start="3305.47" dur="6.6">right direction what I would call</text><text start="3309.67" dur="5.88">legitimate power or power in a game B</text><text start="3312.07" dur="5.549">direction is if I have an asymmetry of</text><text start="3315.55" dur="4.59">power I want to use it to uplift</text><text start="3317.619" dur="4.441">everyone else to have more power and to</text><text start="3320.14" dur="3.78">utilize it better to increase the</text><text start="3322.06" dur="6.36">legitimate power access of everyone else</text><text start="3323.92" dur="7.29">and which is basically what teacherly</text><text start="3328.42" dur="4.14">Authority is right teacher is saying</text><text start="3331.21" dur="3.12">okay I have knowledge that they don&apos;t</text><text start="3332.56"

dur="6.841">developmental way now what I want is</text><text start="3345.0" dur="5.119">people who have that orientation</text><text start="3347.94" dur="4.7">actually get good at power</text><text start="3350.119" dur="6.841">actually develop asymmetric power so</text><text start="3352.64" dur="7.25">it&apos;s not only that the CIA and the CCP</text><text start="3356.96" dur="4.77">and the Kremlin and dark pool</text><text start="3359.89" dur="3.729">organizations that have it in black</text><text start="3361.73" dur="3.93">water but it&apos;s groups that are</text><text start="3363.619" dur="3.93">authentically oriented in the legitimate</text><text start="3365.66" dur="3.899">use of power who are developing it and</text><text start="3367.549" dur="3.591">then

dur="5.941">then maybe even craftier ones will say</text><text start="3633.2" dur="2.52">okay really we have to deal with</text><text start="3634.25" dur="3.66">economic so we&apos;re gonna bring

with tech so</text><text start="3647.0" dur="4.049">you don&apos;t have to do the rainforest</text><text start="3648.23" dur="4.2">stuff and they say awesome do that we</text><text start="3651.049" dur="3.451">don&apos;t think it&apos;ll work if it does work</text><text start="3652.43" dur="3.629">awesome and we&apos;re still doing the Amazon</text><text start="3654.5" dur="3.509">sales because that&apos;s money today and we</text><text start="3656.059" dur="3.841">know how to do that so you don&apos;t just</text><text start="3658.009" dur="4.231">have to bring an alternative you have

other one still</text><text start="3668.089" dur="6.51">kills everything all right well how do</text><text start="3670.549" dur="5.73">you do that so an example in Ecuador</text><text start="3674.599" dur="3.631">could look like this and I&apos;m giving it</text><text start="3676.279" dur="5.57">at a very high topological level but you</text><text start="3678.23" dur="3.619">can just see the types of thinking</text><text start="3681.94" dur="5.53">they&apos;re just like climate change has a</text><text start="3684.95" dur="4.559">runaway positive feedback loop where at</text><text

destruction has a runaway</text><text start="3694.789" dur="3.091">feedback loop because you have this</text><text start="3696.349" dur="2.91">thing called the hydrological pump or</text><text start="3697.88" dur="4.439">waters evaporating through the trees</text><text start="3699.259" dur="5.79">which makes moisture which creates it</text><text start="3702.319" dur="4.95">being a rainforest which keeps pumping</text><text start="3705.049" dur="3.931">water because you have a lot of rain now</text><text start="3707.269" dur="3.391">what happens with that hydrological pump</text><text start="3708.98" dur="3.029">is some of the water falls back over the</text><text start="3710.66" dur="3.03">Amazon and some of it goes into the</text><text start="3712.009" dur="3.181">atmosphere and goes to some convection</text><text start="3713.69" dur="3.27">current and that&apos;s actually where 30 to</text><text start="3715.19" dur="3.81">50 percent yearly if North America&apos;s</text><text start="3716.96" dur="3.93">rainfall comes from its transpiration</text><text start="3719.0" dur="4.079">from the Amazon now you start to lose</text><text start="3720.89" dur="4.8">enough forest cover where you get less</text><text start="3723.079" dur="4.321">rain and then you get less transpiration</text><text start="3725.69" dur="3.569">which gets drier which makes it easier</text><text start="3727.4" dur="3.51">for the to lose more forest cover and</text><text start="3729.259" dur="3.57">fires and like that and you get a kind</text><text start="3730.91" dur="5.04">of runaway dynamic so that&apos;s called</text><text start="3732.829" dur="5.161">breaking the hydrological pump so how</text><text start="3735.95" dur="3.869">far are we with rainforest cover</text><text start="3737.99" dur="4.74">destruction in the Amazon before we get</text><text start="3739.819" dur="5.071">that positive feedback loop we don&apos;t</text><text start="3742.73" dur="3.69">know different scientists hydrologist</text><text start="3744.89" dur="3.57">things somewhere between next year and</text><text start="3746.42" dur="4.31">15 years from now but both of those are</text><text start="3748.46" dur="6.34">really [ __ ] soon and</text><text start="3750.73" dur="7.05">really soon but now you think about okay</text><text start="3754.8" dur="5.92">if you break the hydrological pump and</text><text start="3757.78" dur="4.56">North America loses 30 to 50 percent of</text><text start="3760.72" dur="3.95">its rainfall what&apos;s the effect on the</text><text start="3762.34" dur="4.44">u.s. of that well it pretty much</text><text start="3764.67" dur="3.64">collapses the US as we understand it</text><text start="3766.78" dur="2.97">today we lose agriculture or</text><text start="3768.31" dur="4.799">agricultural production we lose our</text><text start="3769.75" dur="5.58">aquifers it&apos;s we that creates massive</text><text start="3773.109" dur="8.461">both economic hits and national security</text><text start="3775.33" dur="8.19">threats so should the State Department</text><text start="3781.57" dur="4.41">see the

start="3788.05" dur="3.39">nobody&apos;s been thinking about that or</text><text start="3789.7" dur="4.919">putting those together does the State</text><text start="3791.44" dur="5.16">Department have big-boy capabilities to</text><text start="3794.619" dur="3.75">intervene just like the multinationals</text><text start="3796.6" dur="6.66">do with a different set of incentives</text><text

start="3812.2" dur="5.64">yeah that&apos;s a possible strategy so I&apos;ve</text><text start="3815.5" dur="3.63">talked to some people about that State</text><text start="3817.84" dur="2.7">Department they&apos;re like yes if we can</text><text start="3819.13" dur="3.42">see that that&apos;s a real thing then we</text><text start="3820.54" dur="3.81">would ensure that didn&apos;t happen</text><text start="3822.55" dur="5.69">well that by sometime it&apos;s not a</text><text start="3824.35" dur="5.91">long-term solution because you can&apos;t be</text><text start="3828.24" dur="3.91">keeping economic development from</text><text start="3830.26" dur="3.57">happening for a long time so you also</text><text start="3832.15" dur="2.82">then have to propose better economic</text><text start="3833.83" dur="4.08">development opportunities for those</text><text start="3834.97" dur="5.19">countries but that also bind the</text><text start="3837.91" dur="4.89">predatory capitalism parts so rather</text><text start="3840.16" dur="4.26">than say we&apos;re gonna help you ecuador</text><text start="3842.8" dur="3.84">build your own mining company rather</text><text start="3844.42" dur="3.449">than the chinese multinational come in</text><text start="3846.64" dur="2.61">and do the mining for you where they</text><text start="3847.869" dur="2.761">have no incentive to do environmental</text><text start="3849.25" dur="2.7">protection because they&apos;re gonna leave</text><text start="3850.63" dur="3.0">and don&apos;t give a [ __ ] about the toxic</text><text start="3851.95" dur="4.23">tailings left and they don&apos;t even employ</text><text start="3853.63" dur="4.11">local people they bring their own people</text><text start="3856.18" dur="3.39">over and you make a penny on the dollar</text><text start="3857.74" dur="3.54">because you&apos;re just basically selling</text><text start="3859.57" dur="5.85">the asset rights we&apos;re gonna help you</text><text start="3861.28" dur="7.26">create your own national mind where you</text><text start="3865.42" dur="5.22">employ people at a fair wage living</text><text start="3868.54" dur="3.42">there and it&apos;s environmentally safe and</text><text start="3870.64" dur="2.64">you have the right incentive to do it</text><text start="3871.96" dur="2.76">and you don&apos;t have to do anywhere near</text><text start="3873.28" dur="2.91">as much of it to make even more money</text><text start="3874.72" dur="2.58">because you have higher margins and can</text><text start="3876.19" dur="2.4">sell the things on the open market</text><text start="3877.3" dur="2.46">you just don&apos;t have the capability do</text><text start="3878.59" dur="3.18">that upfront so we&apos;re gonna bring the</text><text start="3879.76" dur="3.32">capital and the and the contracting</text><text start="3881.77" dur="2.63">capabilities to help you do that</text><text start="3883.08" dur="2.76">we can&apos;t</text><text start="3884.4" dur="6.51">do that because I still doesn&apos;t bind the</text><text start="3885.84" dur="6.42">other thing what we say is can we get</text><text start="3890.91" dur="5.52">this if the State Department got</text><text start="3892.26" dur="6.09">involved and said [ __ ] we actually have</text><text start="3896.43" dur="3.66">to do this ongoingly and we can&apos;t do it</text><text start="3898.35" dur="3.99">militaristically we need to get the debt</text><text start="3900.09" dur="4.02">forgiven can the State

dur="3.9">sure it could could the World Bank put</text><text start="3907.29" dur="3.69">pressure on the Chinese government to do</text><text start="3909.15" dur="3.36">the same thing and not down grade the</text><text start="3910.98" dur="2.76">quality of their debt yeah they could</text><text start="3912.51" dur="3.33">there&apos;s an arrangement you could make</text><text start="3913.74" dur="5.97">there so now let&apos;s say we create an</text><text start="3915.84" dur="5.34">organization we start to talk to the</text><text start="3919.71" dur="2.64">State Department about that deal start</text><text start="3921.18" dur="2.52">to talk to the world bank about that</text><text start="3922.35" dur="4.5">they&apos;ll see how to kind of set that</text><text start="3923.7" dur="5.19">thing up and then we also look at how to</text><text start="3926.85" dur="5.22">do them mining properly that creates</text><text start="3928.89" dur="5.49">wealth for the people in the area and so</text><text start="3932.07" dur="3.33">we now we come to the president of</text><text start="3934.38" dur="3.12">Ecuador and the other people and say</text><text start="3935.4" dur="5.64">look we have a deal we can get your debt</text><text start="3937.5" dur="5.13">forgiven and we can increase the</text><text start="3941.04" dur="3.57">economic prosperity of your country more</text><text

making you time man</text><text start="3948.36" dur="4.98">magazine man of the year and a hero to</text><text start="3950.37" dur="5.76">your people and internationally and then</text><text start="3953.34" dur="4.65">you become the leader of how to best do</text><text start="3956.13" dur="4.32">developing nations in the South American</text><text start="3957.99" dur="4.29">region now here&apos;s the deal we&apos;ve we&apos;ve</text><text start="3960.45" dur="3.27">set up this whole bundle package and</text><text start="3962.28" dur="4.77">we&apos;ll help you with it and will actually</text><text start="3963.72" dur="4.92">help kick off then not just the mining</text><text start="3967.05" dur="4.62">but the schools and all these other</text><text start="3968.64" dur="7.49">things and this because the mining will</text><text start="3971.67" dur="7.56">be very high profit but say schools and</text><text start="3976.13" dur="5.02">roads and County clinics need money</text><text start="3979.23" dur="4.46">subsidized from somewhere so we bundle</text><text start="3981.15" dur="5.22">it into a investable operating agreement</text><text start="3983.69" dur="4.12">where it&apos;s net profitable and highly</text><text start="3986.37" dur="2.85">securitized because it&apos;s basic</text><text start="3987.81" dur="4.76">infrastructure backed by their own</text><text start="3989.22" dur="5.67">government bonds in a world where most</text><text start="3992.57" dur="4.15">bonds are negative interest yielding</text><text start="3994.89" dur="3.42">right now so we can get massive pension</text><text start="3996.72" dur="3.15">funds with trillions of dollars to be</text><text start="3998.31" dur="2.7">able to get a couple percent return and</text><text start="3999.87" dur="3.36">they like the things so we say look</text><text start="4001.01" dur="3.99">here&apos;s the deal we will mezzanine</text><text start="4003.23" dur="3.39">finance this thing for you we&apos;ll open it</text><text start="4005.0" dur="3.21">up to the capital markets and get the</text><text start="4006.62" dur="3.21">Canadian and Norwegian and

dur="3.18">this kind of stuff but it&apos;s an</text><text start="4013.25" dur="3.15">all-or-nothing package like you either</text><text start="4015.2" dur="2.19">get the whole [ __ ] bundle or you</text><text start="4016.4" dur="3.449">don&apos;t get any of it</text><text start="4017.39" dur="3.75">now can we make a more attractive bundle</text><text start="4019.849" dur="3.95">than the [ __ ] up when they&apos;re giving</text><text start="4021.14" dur="5.31">and that&apos;s using manipulative tactics</text><text start="4023.799" dur="4.21">but that are actually in the service of</text><text start="4026.45" dur="3.299">the environment and the people rather</text><text start="4028.009" dur="3.211">than [ __ ] the the environment and the</text><text start="4029.749" dur="5.06">people to extract as much as we can and</text><text start="4031.22" dur="7.609">externalize that would be called using</text><text start="4034.809" dur="6.821">game a tools well towards a</text><text start="4038.829" dur="4.66">authentically game be oriented kind of</text><text start="4041.63" dur="3.419">purpose now Ecuador starts doing better</text><text start="4043.489" dur="3.181">and Brazil&apos;s like [ __ ] we want this deal</text><text start="4045.049" dur="6.06">and you start to get a race to the top</text><text start="4046.67" dur="7.29">between the countries

is</text><text start="4330.3" dur="4.32">whether you have what it takes to make</text><text start="4331.56" dur="6.33">it into that group or not and so that&apos;s</text><text start="4334.62"

dur="4.56">acknowledging that the arms race that</text><text start="4444.36" dur="4.7">has always won self terminates pretty</text><text start="4446.52" dur="4.8">soon because when you

dur="3.18">it&apos;s gibberish but it&apos;s compelling</text><text start="4454.74" dur="3.6">enough gibberish that if you kind of</text><text start="4456.24" dur="4.46">want to do it anyways

dur="6.48">and so that was the power is inexorable</text><text start="4495.9" dur="4.05">and then the power has virtue is since</text><text start="4498.06" dur="4.62">this is the only way to be

it</text><text start="4512.55" dur="5.22">basically tried to take whatever ethical</text><text start="4515.27" dur="7.48">immune system people had that would</text><text start="4517.77" dur="7.5">resist illegitimate evil applications of</text><text start="4522.75" dur="6.18">power and say that&apos;s not possible</text><text start="4525.27" dur="5.28">and then actually hook it into those</text><text start="4528.93" dur="3.69">evil applications of power are the only</text><text start="4530.55" dur="3.54">ethical thing which is basically trying</text><text start="4532.62"

dur="2.42">audience with</text><text start="4847.15" dur="2.06">you</text><text start="4849.4" dur="7.529">I will also say this the sex question</text><text start="4855.429" dur="5.401">was specifically around I guess</text><text start="4856.929" dur="5.25">anti-rattle this is something of very</text><text start="4860.83" dur="11.19">much interest you can give us a</text><text start="4862.179" dur="15.421">cliffhanger on that and there&apos;s a very</text><text start="4872.02" dur="7.38">short book that I really loved that was</text><text start="4877.6" dur="5.73">one of the more influential books on me</text><text start="4879.4" dur="7.35">growing up it&apos;s by a Jesuit priest who</text><text start="4883.33" dur="5.25">is also a student of Eastern traditions</text><text start="4886.75" dur="5.31">named Anthony de Mello the book is</text><text start="4888.58" dur="5.04">called the way to love and it&apos;s a tiny</text><text start="4892.06" dur="7.32">little pocket book of these kind of</text><text start="4893.62" dur="9.09">reflections or meditations there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="4899.38" dur="6.63">of ideas around sex that I would talk</text><text start="4902.71" dur="4.92">about that if people are not familiar</text><text start="4906.01" dur="3.87">with the ideas he brings up in there</text><text start="4907.63" dur="5.64">they won&apos;t actually have the basis for</text><text start="4909.88" dur="4.26">some of the value system so of course we</text><text start="4913.27" dur="2.49">can talk about it from an evolutionary</text><text start="4914.14" dur="4.55">buy out perspective and we have to do</text><text start="4915.76" dur="4.919">that and an economic perspective and a</text><text start="4918.69" dur="5.32">child-rearing perspective and all those</text><text start="4920.679" dur="8.011">things but insofar as the question</text><text start="4924.01" dur="6.54">around you know you have the the</text><text start="4928.69" dur="4.59">Buddhist desire as the source of all</text><text start="4930.55" dur="4.2">suffering and the Western desire is the</text><text start="4933.28" dur="4.08">source of all creativity and goodness</text><text start="4934.75" dur="3.84">and we&apos;re here to be creators made in</text><text start="4937.36" dur="3.089">the image and likeness of the Creator</text><text start="4938.59" dur="3.569">those are really different models about</text><text start="4940.449" dur="3.21">the nature of desire and that&apos;s actually</text><text start="4942.159" dur="3.241">something we kind of have to wrestle</text><text start="4943.659" dur="3.181">with and the whole topic of are there</text><text start="4945.4" dur="2.88">types of desire that are more</text><text start="4946.84" dur="3.96">destructive and types that are more</text><text start="4948.28" dur="4.05">healthfully constructive and do they</text><text start="4950.8" dur="3.78">come from different places is there</text><text start="4952.33" dur="3.9">desire from more wholeness or less</text><text start="4954.58" dur="5.34">wholeness that leads in a direction of</text><text start="4956.23" dur="5.13">kind of increased wholeness individually</text><text start="4959.92" dur="3.39">and for the relationships versus</text><text start="4961.36" dur="4.17">addiction whatever so there&apos;s stuff</text><text start="4963.31" dur="5.88">around that that becomes the basis to</text><text start="4965.53" dur="5.66">think about sexual desire and sexual</text><text start="4969.19" dur="4.89">rivalry and all those types of things so</text><text start="4971.19" dur="4.66">yeah I recommend it in that book and I</text><text start="4974.08" dur="3.36">will be particularly inclined to come</text><text start="4975.85" dur="2.99">back and talk about it if I hear that a</text><text start="4977.44" dur="12.44">bunch of people have read it</text><text start="4978.84" dur="13.38">oh I can jump in here film hi and yeah</text><text start="4989.88" dur="4.38">it&apos;s funny Daniel it&apos;s like that we had</text><text start="4992.22" dur="3.96">a session earlier today may be great is</text><text start="4994.26" dur="3.39">something on only fans at Ross sexuality</text><text start="4996.18" dur="2.13">but he does coming on Friday doing the</text><text start="4997.65" dur="3.06">lust-filled</text><text start="4998.31" dur="3.99">I&apos;m you read my journals I&apos;m horny all</text><text start="5000.71" dur="3.36">the time so we&apos;re becoming like</text><text start="5002.3" dur="3.06">existential perverse here at the stoma</text><text start="5004.07" dur="3.09">so I think we&apos;re all gonna read that</text><text start="5005.36" dur="5.1">book and then get you back to talk about</text><text start="5007.16" dur="5.4">it so Phil thanks for the I&apos;m seeing and</text><text start="5010.46" dur="4.16">Daniel thanks so much for coming today</text><text start="5012.56" dur="3.9">if people haven&apos;t read it</text><text start="5014.62" dur="3.58">Wilhelm Reich&apos;s work was very</text><text start="5016.46" dur="3.42">interesting on the topic I&apos;m not saying</text><text start="5018.2" dur="3.8">I agree with it but it&apos;s it&apos;s one of the</text><text start="5019.88" dur="4.89">things it should be thought about he was</text><text start="5022.0" dur="4.33">basically saying what was wrong with</text><text start="5024.77" dur="3.21">Marxism and one of the things he</text><text start="5026.33" dur="3.48">assessed was that Marxism didn&apos;t deal</text><text start="5027.98" dur="4.53">with sexual ownership and the the</text><text start="5029.81" dur="4.14">impulse for non communitarian things</text><text start="5032.51" dur="3.6">that arises actually in how to deal with</text><text start="5033.95" dur="4.2">that and that became actually one of the</text><text start="5036.11" dur="3.57">deep intellectual basis of the free love</text><text start="5038.15" dur="3.09">movement which i think is not the right</text><text start="5039.68" dur="4.59">answer but just to kind of understand</text><text start="5041.24" dur="4.26">one of the directions and specifically</text><text start="5044.27" dur="3.24">it had to do with him looking at the</text><text start="5045.5" dur="4.74">relationship between sexual repression</text><text start="5047.51" dur="5.96">and violence across cultures which is</text><text start="5050.24" dur="5.87">very interesting sociologically and</text><text start="5053.47" dur="6.4">almost like the follow-up to that work</text><text start="5056.11" dur="7.0">half a century later was sex at dawn hmm</text><text start="5059.87" dur="5.7">which was influenced by that and so it&apos;s</text><text start="5063.11" dur="4.2">valuable to read sexy dawn it&apos;s also</text><text start="5065.57" dur="3.39">valuable to read the critiques of sex at</text><text start="5067.31" dur="4.1">dawn some of which are really deep and</text><text start="5068.96" dur="5.64">important some of which are specious and</text><text start="5071.41" dur="4.45">those are all kind of some basis to</text><text start="5074.6" dur="3.9">start to have the conversation a little</text><text start="5075.86" dur="5.13">more informally right I think there&apos;s a</text><text start="5078.5" dur="5.07">book sex at dust it was a critic</text><text start="5080.99" dur="4.05">yeah yeah cool it&apos;s like
