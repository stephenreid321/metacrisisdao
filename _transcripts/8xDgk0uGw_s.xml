here</text><text start="65.309" dur="5.551">has not studied conflict theory you&apos;re</text><text start="68.939" dur="3.93">gonna have a hard time making sense of</text><text start="70.86" dur="4.47">the world without a good model of how</text><text start="72.869" dur="4.591">conflict arises between people how it</text><text start="75.33" dur="3.84">gets intentionally stirred up how people</text><text start="77.46" dur="4.229">resolve it and there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="79.17" dur="5.73">difference schools of conflict Syria</text><text start="81.689" dur="6.201">that are worth studying but at a minimum</text><text start="84.9" dur="9.81">everybody should know Rene Gerard&apos;s work</text><text start="87.89" dur="9.01">and I&apos;m not saying that I agree with</text><text start="94.71" dur="7.409">Gerard there are things that he said</text><text start="96.9" dur="7.73">that we&apos;re extremely insightful so</text><text start="102.119" dur="6.481">specifically his idea is that the</text><text start="104.63" dur="7.32">fundamental nature of conflict comes</text><text start="108.6" dur="7.65">from the fact that desire is mimetic</text><text start="111.95" dur="6.16">meaning that we learn to want stuff the</text><text start="116.25" dur="4.649">same way we learn language by watching</text><text start="118.11" dur="5.28">other people and that I don&apos;t know</text><text start="120.899" dur="3.871">Mandarin and I don&apos;t know so he Lee and</text><text start="123.39" dur="2.64">I don&apos;t know Dutch because I didn&apos;t</text><text start="124.77" dur="3.15">watch people speaking those I watch</text><text start="126.03" dur="4.08">people speak in English so I got</text><text start="127.92" dur="4.24">conditioned to think in a world view</text><text start="130.11" dur="5.08">through aesthetic frames through</text><text start="132.16" dur="5.19">like it&apos;s very deep how much my whole</text><text start="135.19" dur="4.44">identity and everything was conditioned</text><text start="137.35" dur="4.83">by what I watched so his arguments is</text><text start="139.63" dur="6.72">that much of what we want is also</text><text start="142.18" dur="6.27">conditioned by watching people and so we</text><text start="146.35" dur="4.56">end up in Nate Lee wanting what other</text><text start="148.45" dur="4.86">people have which means that desire</text><text start="150.91" dur="5.1">inexorably drives conflict somebody</text><text start="153.31" dur="5.82">people have stuff you want that thing or</text><text start="156.01" dur="4.8">similar kinds of things then as more</text><text start="159.13" dur="3.6">people are wanting the same things and</text><text start="160.81" dur="4.44">conflicting over it the conflict itself</text><text start="162.73" dur="5.94">becomes mimetic people learn through</text><text start="165.25" dur="5.22">mimesis to identify with the Zionists or</text><text start="168.67" dur="3.78">the anti Zionist side based on which</text><text start="170.47" dur="4.11">side of the wall they grew up on or the</text><text start="172.45" dur="4.58">you know whatever the conflict they</text><text start="174.58" dur="5.7">happen to have been born into and then</text><text start="177.03" dur="5.02">in Gerard&apos;s model the conflict continues</text><text start="180.28" dur="4.5">to increase until there&apos;s so much</text><text start="182.05" dur="4.56">embodied energy that you&apos;re gonna get</text><text start="184.78" dur="3.72">something like a war and the least</text><text start="186.61" dur="5.31">violent way to deal with it is to have a</text><text start="188.5" dur="5.88">scapegoat a sacrificial rather than a</text><text start="191.92" dur="4.97">all against all war be able to have some</text><text start="194.38" dur="5.07">sacrificial person that everybody gets</text><text start="196.89" dur="5.2">that is able to be effectively blamed</text><text start="199.45" dur="4.8">for the whole scenario and then we&apos;re</text><text start="202.09" dur="3.84">able to take them out and decrease the</text><text start="204.25" dur="8.94">embodied conflict energy for a while</text><text start="205.93" dur="11.19">then the cycle has to repeat Georg work</text><text start="213.19" dur="5.82">really says that there is no there</text><text start="217.12" dur="4.74">historically has been no way out of that</text><text start="219.01" dur="5.729">and the role of various religions was to</text><text start="221.86" dur="5.129">figure out how to do scapegoating well</text><text start="224.739" dur="3.841">and that that&apos;s what all of the</text><text start="226.989" dur="5.161">sacrifices of various religious</text><text start="228.58" dur="5.22">traditions were about that Christianity</text><text start="232.15" dur="3.63">was actually trying to get rid of</text><text start="233.8" dur="4.29">scapegoating by showing that the person</text><text start="235.78" dur="4.08">they scapegoated was actually innocent -</text><text start="238.09" dur="4.23">not only innocent but the highest kind</text><text start="239.86" dur="6.18">of innocence so that the way people</text><text start="242.32" dur="4.98">would get out of his answer actually of</text><text start="246.04" dur="4.61">how you get out of scapegoating was</text><text start="247.3" dur="3.35">everyone developed christ-like virtues</text><text start="251.01" dur="4.84">but specifically as critique said that</text><text start="253.78" dur="3.78">by getting rid of religion and this is</text><text start="255.85" dur="5.79">relevant to the goals of this group that</text><text start="257.56" dur="8.0">is trying to reinvent the development of</text><text start="261.64" dur="6.89">human virtue by</text><text start="265.56" dur="6.81">rid of religion we got rid of the way of</text><text start="268.53" dur="6.18">dealing with the mimetic conflict while</text><text start="272.37" dur="4.89">simultaneously getting much much larger</text><text start="274.71" dur="11.61">weapons of destruction okay so why am i</text><text start="277.26" dur="12.42">bringing that up I think it&apos;s very easy</text><text start="286.32" dur="8.13">to I think there are lots of reasons to</text><text start="289.68" dur="7.709">want to drive conflict and to want to</text><text start="294.45" dur="5.67">keep groups of people having attention</text><text start="297.389" dur="6.771">focused in different ways maybe this is</text><text start="300.12" dur="4.04">actually the way I&apos;ll talk about it</text><text start="304.43" dur="6.94">power pretty much translates to power</text><text start="307.38" dur="5.55">over other people to have power over</text><text start="311.37" dur="4.26">their behaviors whether I want people to</text><text start="312.93" dur="4.739">vote for me in a particular way or I</text><text start="315.63" dur="4.92">want them to buy my stuff or I want them</text><text start="317.669" dur="4.411">to publicly support my ideas I need to</text><text start="320.55" dur="2.94">control other people&apos;s behavior to</text><text start="322.08" dur="8.72">control their behavior I need to control</text><text start="323.49" dur="10.29">their minds and so warfare is main</text><text start="330.8" dur="4.72">mainly not fought with bullets like the</text><text start="333.78" dur="4.199">kinetic warfare that we think of as</text><text start="335.52" dur="6.63">warfare that&apos;s fought with weapons is</text><text start="337.979" dur="6.091">maybe 1% of warfare 99% of warfare is</text><text start="342.15" dur="4.079">diplomatic warfare political warfare</text><text start="344.07" dur="4.68">economic warfare narrative warfare</text><text start="346.229" dur="4.891">information warfare all of this comes</text><text start="348.75" dur="5.25">together to what we call hybrid warfare</text><text start="351.12" dur="7.41">or really just politics or game theory</text><text start="354.0" dur="9.24">or the game of power but but think of it</text><text start="358.53" dur="10.8">as high hybrid or population centric</text><text start="363.24" dur="8.58">warfare so in this war the treasure</text><text start="369.33" dur="6.62">being fought over is people&apos;s minds and</text><text start="371.82" dur="4.13">the battleground is people&apos;s minds the</text><text start="376.16" dur="9.64">primary weapons are tools the tools of</text><text start="382.86" dur="4.529">narrative influence and emotionally</text><text start="385.8" dur="3.729">vacation and control of the information</text><text start="387.389" dur="6.16">flows</text><text start="389.529" dur="6.18">and in these wars they&apos;re asymmetric</text><text start="393.549" dur="3.66">wars because you have some actors that</text><text start="395.709" dur="5.79">have access to billion or</text><text start="397.209" dur="7.98">trillion-dollar level information</text><text start="401.499" dur="5.73">technologies and AI empowered micro</text><text start="405.189" dur="3.18">targeting and then you have other people</text><text start="407.229" dur="2.43">that are just trying to figure out</text><text start="408.369" dur="3.66">on their own and they don&apos;t even know</text><text start="409.659" dur="4.2">they&apos;re in a war and they don&apos;t even</text><text start="412.029" dur="3.21">know that their own mind is the</text><text start="413.859" dur="2.7">battleground of the war and they think</text><text start="415.239" dur="2.58">they believe the they believe and</text><text start="416.559" dur="2.4">they think they came to it on their own</text><text start="417.819" dur="4.29">they think they&apos;re doing a good job</text><text start="418.959" dur="6.78">sense-making and they don&apos;t realize that</text><text start="422.109" dur="5.7">as they&apos;re researching of the trillions</text><text start="425.739" dur="3.81">of pages of they could see the ones</text><text start="427.809" dur="3.33">that they will ever even be able to see</text><text start="429.549" dur="3.36">based on what shows up in their YouTube</text><text start="431.139" dur="3.72">feed or their Google search or</text><text start="432.909" dur="6.66">manipulated by algorithms that have</text><text start="434.859" dur="6.42">agendas behind them as well as the</text><text start="439.569" dur="5.97">original source material of whoever put</text><text start="441.279" dur="6.78">it out for which reasons ok so zooming</text><text start="445.539" dur="5.79">out from the current violence from</text><text start="448.059" dur="8.19">moments we have an election coming up in</text><text start="451.329" dur="8.031">the u.s. that will be radically</text><text start="456.249" dur="7.77">consequential for the world either way</text><text start="459.36" dur="6.759">no matter who wins currently whether the</text><text start="464.019" dur="3.9">election is illegally tampered with and</text><text start="466.119" dur="6.81">stolen or not half of the population</text><text start="467.919" dur="7.95">will think it was this is a real problem</text><text start="472.929" dur="4.56">right because what happens when a third</text><text start="475.869" dur="3.69">to a half of the population no matter</text><text start="477.489" dur="3.75">which way it goes thinks that it was</text><text start="479.559" dur="4.2">stolen and thinks it was radically</text><text start="481.239" dur="6.0">consequential well like one of two</text><text start="483.759" dur="7.89">really bad things happens either the</text><text start="487.239" dur="5.69">people get violent much more so than we</text><text start="491.649" dur="5.43">currently have</text><text start="492.929" dur="5.53">and that sets off one whole cascade of</text><text start="497.079" dur="3.18">scenarios where they don&apos;t get violent</text><text start="498.459" dur="3.42">and the people who want to steal</text><text start="500.259" dur="5.97">elections get even clearer that they</text><text start="501.879" dur="7.44">just can with impunity so we&apos;re like</text><text start="506.229" dur="8.071"> what do we do with this moving</text><text start="509.319" dur="10.35">forward now mail-in ballots our mail-in</text><text start="514.3" dur="8.28">ballots easier to corrupt than in-person</text><text start="519.669" dur="7.061">voting yep</text><text start="522.58" dur="6.22">and co vid as one reason violence could</text><text start="526.73" dur="4.59">be another but cove it is one reason to</text><text start="528.8" dur="6.54">have mail-in ballots like might there be</text><text start="531.32" dur="6.0">reasons associated with that yeah now</text><text start="535.34" dur="3.78">might there be reasons that people who</text><text start="537.32" dur="4.62">really want Trump out of office would</text><text start="539.12" dur="4.65">want to initiate things that make Trump</text><text start="541.94" dur="4.01">look worse and that say look at all the</text><text start="543.77" dur="4.56">bad that&apos;s happening during Trump</text><text start="545.95" dur="6.97">we could also talk about what motive the</text><text start="548.33" dur="5.85">Trump campaign would have to be engaged</text><text start="552.92" dur="4.91">in something where you wouldn&apos;t want</text><text start="554.18" dur="6.6">transfer of power to occur so I&apos;m not</text><text start="557.83" dur="4.96">there&apos;s a there&apos;s a version of this that</text><text start="560.78" dur="8.4">is easy to buy for either political</text><text start="562.79" dur="8.19">leaning I don&apos;t find that most</text><text start="569.18" dur="3.66">successful politicians that I have</text><text start="570.98" dur="5.03">encountered near the top of the power</text><text start="572.84" dur="5.73">actually believe red vs. blue ideology</text><text start="576.01" dur="5.14">they just believe in the game of power</text><text start="578.57" dur="4.41">and they signal red vs. blue ideology as</text><text start="581.15" dur="2.76">part of their mimetic warfare to control</text><text start="582.98" dur="4.95">the people that are going to vote for</text><text start="583.91" dur="9.96">them just like I don&apos;t think most of the</text><text start="587.93" dur="8.159">people that end up engaging religions</text><text start="593.87" dur="6.9">and holy wars at the most strategic</text><text start="596.089" dur="6.091">level really even are religious I think</text><text start="600.77" dur="3.06">they know that these are ways to get</text><text start="602.18" dur="6.72">people to do things for reasons that are</text><text start="603.83" dur="6.24">mostly strategic as we look at war a</text><text start="608.9" dur="3.0">little bit more and we look at the</text><text start="610.07" dur="5.49">tension heating up on the India China</text><text start="611.9" dur="5.43">border is such a big deal like what&apos;s</text><text start="615.56" dur="4.59">happening there and the India China</text><text start="617.33" dur="7.53">Pakistan interaction and the India China</text><text start="620.15" dur="7.56">Russia interaction and as we look at it</text><text start="624.86" dur="4.83">with kovat related stuff obviously what</text><text start="627.71" dur="3.87">what happens to the spread of the virus</text><text start="629.69" dur="3.84">with all of the protests that are</text><text start="631.58" dur="10.44">definitely not social distancing well</text><text start="633.53" dur="10.94">we&apos;ll find out what happens when like</text><text start="642.02" dur="5.04">with Germany and South Korea and China</text><text start="644.47" dur="4.57">who started to get second waves of</text><text start="647.06" dur="3.99">infection after reopening what happens</text><text start="649.04" dur="4.919">when we start to get second waves here</text><text start="651.05" dur="4.5">and the political tension is so heated</text><text start="653.959" dur="9.481">around the idea</text><text start="655.55" dur="10.59">of closing again and then we also start</text><text start="663.44" dur="7.92">to see things like because of the Cova</text><text start="666.14" dur="7.23">chat down of
