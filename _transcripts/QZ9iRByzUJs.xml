like to really get a sense the</text><text start="44.239" dur="3.681">trump supporters feel that trump is the</text><text start="45.68" dur="3.6">only thing standing between</text><text start="47.92"

they both think the other side is</text><text start="78.799" dur="3.041">going to steal it they&apos;re set up</text><text start="80.72" dur="2.24">to actually think that there isn&apos;t</text><text start="81.84" dur="3.0">election security it&apos;s going to be</text><text start="82.96" dur="4.24">stolen so what happens when the election</text><text start="84.84" dur="4.52">comes and</text><text start="87.2" dur="4.239">it&apos;s not held as valid and it&apos;s held as</text><text start="89.36" dur="3.36">existential and we have these mounting</text><text start="91.439" dur="3.36">tensions</text><text start="92.72" dur="3.759">already that were there with kovid</text><text start="94.799" dur="3.441">because of lockdown lockdown means more</text><text start="96.479" dur="4.96">news cycle to take all the stuff in</text><text start="98.24" dur="5.76">right and</text><text start="101.439" dur="3.761">then also it means radically increasing</text><text start="104.0" dur="3.68">unemployment</text><text start="105.2" dur="3.919">and we so when we saw the violence start</text><text start="107.68" dur="3.04">with george floyd</text><text start="109.119" dur="3.921">violence was actually bound to start</text><text start="110.72" dur="5.999">from some trigger</text><text start="113.04" dur="6.96">uh when you study kind of the societal</text><text

start="127.2" dur="3.199">system</text><text start="128.319" dur="4.241">and so when you start having massive</text><text start="130.399" dur="4.48">unemployment that&apos;s a very unstable</text><text start="132.56" dur="3.84">situation for the overall system and</text><text start="134.879" dur="3.761">it&apos;s going to express itself somehow</text><text start="136.4" dur="3.68">and no one really has the ability to</text><text start="138.64" dur="4.8">process any of this</text><text start="140.08" dur="5.44">well nor are the nor is the reporting</text><text start="143.44" dur="3.439">oriented to try to process it in an</text><text start="145.52" dur="2.48">adequate way which is actually a really</text><text start="146.879" dur="3.121">hard thing to do</text><text start="148.0" dur="4.8">there&apos;s much higher incentive to control</text><text start="150.0" dur="4.4">a narrative for particular purposes</text><text start="152.8" dur="3.28">and so for the most part people have</text><text start="154.4" dur="4.64">kind of traded epistemology</text><text start="156.08" dur="5.04">for tribalism meaning given up on trying</text><text start="159.04" dur="2.8">to do a rigorous job of making sense of</text><text start="161.12" dur="3.04">things</text><text start="161.84" dur="3.759">themselves like take a narrative take a</text><text start="164.16"

dur="4.0">and then look at each of those</text><text start="170.48" dur="4.64">propositions what evidence do i have to</text><text start="173.28" dur="3.679">verify it or falsify it</text><text

dur="3.6">they&apos;re really doing</text><text start="191.68" dur="4.16">is paying attention to what feels true</text><text start="194.08" dur="2.32">which largely has to do with what people</text><text start="195.84" dur="2.56">like me</text><text start="196.4" dur="3.04">kind of seem to think and which team i</text><text start="198.4" dur="3.16">kind of want to be on</text><text

perspective</text><text start="207.04" dur="3.6">for a minute</text><text start="209.36" dur="3.04">humans have been here for a long time</text><text start="210.64" dur="3.679">but the thing that we call civilization</text><text start="212.4" dur="4.64">which was much larger than tribal</text><text start="214.319" dur="4.0">scale starting to organize early egypt</text><text start="217.04" dur="3.44">or sumeria or whatever</text><text start="218.319" dur="4.321">since the beginning of that larger scale</text><text start="220.48" dur="4.96">coordination</text><text start="222.64" dur="3.44">a tiny percentage of the people that</text><text start="225.44" dur="2.079">ever lived</text><text start="226.08" dur="3.2">lived in something like a republic or</text><text start="227.519" dur="4.961">democracy</text><text start="229.28" dur="5.599">they almost all lived in a feudalism or</text><text start="232.48" dur="3.6">monarchy or some kind of much more</text><text start="234.879" dur="3.841">top-down autocratic</text><text start="236.08" dur="3.519">system which is actually quite easy to</text><text start="238.72" dur="2.96">understand</text><text start="239.599" dur="4.481">because the proposition of a republic or</text><text start="241.68" dur="4.08">democracy a participatory governance is</text><text start="244.08" dur="3.359">actually a wild proposition</text><text start="245.76" dur="2.88">which is that a huge number of people</text><text start="247.439" dur="2.8">who don&apos;t know each other who want</text><text start="248.64" dur="2.799">different things can sublimate their</text><text start="250.239" dur="2.961">desire and difference</text><text start="251.439" dur="3.44">to coordinate with each other it&apos;s like</text><text start="253.2" dur="3.84">that&apos;s actually kind of oh</text><text start="254.879" dur="4.001">it&apos;s understandable that&apos;s a hard thing</text><text start="257.04" dur="2.879">right this is why corporations aren&apos;t</text><text start="258.88" dur="2.079">run that way corporations are</text><text start="259.919" dur="3.521">autocracies</text><text start="260.959" dur="4.561">and so the few times throughout history</text><text start="263.44" dur="3.4">that a republic or a democracy emerged</text><text start="265.52" dur="2.56">they&apos;re actually really kind of worth</text><text start="266.84" dur="2.84">studying</text><text start="268.08" dur="3.52">and i&apos;m going to simplify here but it&apos;s</text><text start="269.68" dur="3.92">a fair simplification</text><text start="271.6" dur="4.48">they emerged following a period of a</text><text start="273.6" dur="3.84">cultural enlightenment for that culture</text><text start="276.08" dur="2.96">and the cultural enlightenments always</text><text start="277.44" dur="2.88">had at least a couple things in common</text><text start="279.04" dur="2.879">so if we look at the</text><text start="280.32" dur="3.28">kind of early greek democracies the</text><text start="281.919" dur="2.961">athenian democracy of course we can</text><text start="283.6" dur="2.8">criticize that there&apos;s a lot that wasn&apos;t</text><text start="284.88" dur="2.64">perfect about it but it was a movement</text><text start="286.4" dur="3.68">in the direction of</text><text start="287.52" dur="3.679">more participatory governance it was</text><text start="290.08" dur="3.92">following</text><text start="291.199" dur="5.201">the kind of greek enlightenment that</text><text

let&apos;s</text><text start="299.28" dur="2.4">have them all learn philosophy let&apos;s</text><text start="300.72" dur="2.88">have them all learn</text><text start="301.68" dur="3.12">formal logic and rhetoric and the arts</text><text start="303.6" dur="4.0">and these types of things</text><text start="304.8" dur="4.56">so that everyone can have a sense of how</text><text start="307.6" dur="2.4">to know the true plus the good and the</text><text start="309.36" dur="4.16">beautiful right</text><text start="310.0" dur="5.919">like all of an integrated sense of those</text><text start="313.52" dur="3.76">understand what types of systems worked</text><text start="315.919" dur="3.041">and didn&apos;t work in the past because of</text><text start="317.28" dur="4.32">more kind of knowledge of history</text><text start="318.96" dur="3.84">so if everyone can basically sense base</text><text start="321.6" dur="3.76">reality on their own</text><text start="322.8" dur="3.76">well which has to be trained right like</text><text start="325.36" dur="1.76">there&apos;s actually training involved in</text><text start="326.56" dur="2.8">that</text><text start="327.12" dur="3.919">and then there was also the value of the</text><text start="329.36" dur="3.52">socratic dialogue</text><text start="331.039" dur="3.361">and in the socratic dialogue everybody</text><text start="332.88" dur="2.48">is being trained to be able to take</text><text start="334.4" dur="2.4">every perspective</text><text start="335.36" dur="3.44">i can argue this side then i can move</text><text start="336.8" dur="2.8">around and argue this side if people are</text><text start="338.8" dur="3.92">being trained</text><text start="339.6" dur="4.64">in that kind of dialectical process that</text><text start="342.72" dur="3.52">means i&apos;m being trained in</text><text start="344.24" dur="4.08">seeking to understand the perspective of</text><text start="346.24" dur="3.76">others and actually be able to argue</text><text start="348.32" dur="3.28">them even better which is steel manning</text><text start="350.0" dur="2.88">right</text><text start="351.6" dur="3.12">well if you have a bunch of people who</text><text start="352.88" dur="2.48">can all understand reality on their own</text><text start="354.72" dur="1.919">well</text><text start="355.36" dur="2.8">and they can have high quality</text><text start="356.639" dur="2.721">conversations and take each other&apos;s</text><text start="358.16" dur="3.84">perspective not just</text><text start="359.36" dur="3.36">go into tribalism and otherness and make</text><text start="362.0" dur="2.8">a</text><text start="362.72" dur="3.84">villain or a straw man of the other</text><text start="364.8" dur="4.0">those people can start to have the kinds</text><text start="366.56" dur="3.6">of conversations to share sense making</text><text start="368.8" dur="2.8">that leads to being able to make</text><text start="370.16" dur="2.72">collective choices and then they don&apos;t</text><text start="371.6" dur="2.48">need rulers and they can say like we can</text><text start="372.88" dur="3.599">throw the rulers off</text><text start="374.08" dur="4.08">and do a participatory governance system</text><text start="376.479" dur="4.081">the european enlightenment which led to</text><text start="378.16" dur="3.84">the foundation of the u.s and</text><text start="380.56" dur="3.84">a reformation of a lot of kind of</text><text start="382.0" dur="3.759">european and other global governance the</text><text start="384.4" dur="3.919">kind of modern era</text><text start="385.759" dur="4.241">similarly was the renaissance right the</text><text start="388.319" dur="3.681">idea that people would be renaissance</text><text start="390.0" dur="4.24">men or renaissance people who actually</text><text start="392.0" dur="3.919">train in lots of disciplines</text><text start="394.24" dur="3.519">not just be specialists because it&apos;s</text><text start="395.919" dur="3.12">very hard if someone&apos;s just a specialist</text><text start="397.759" dur="3.44">to make sense of the

so the idea of</text><text start="405.039" dur="3.841">renaissance person and then</text><text start="406.639" dur="3.921">of natural philosophy and science that</text><text start="408.88" dur="3.759">we can actually empirically tell what&apos;s</text><text start="410.56" dur="4.32">going on and have the same conversation</text><text start="412.639" dur="3.28">based on that plus kind of the hegelian</text><text start="414.88" dur="3.599">dialectic</text><text start="415.919" dur="4.161">we can seek a thesis and then seek an</text><text start="418.479" dur="4.401">antithesis and then see is there a</text><text start="420.08" dur="4.32">higher order synthesis if people can do</text><text start="422.88" dur="3.439">that well</text><text start="424.4" dur="3.519">a town hall is a

is a possible thing if that</text><text start="430.479" dur="4.961">starts to break down</text><text start="432.16" dur="3.92">where people can&apos;t actually make sense</text><text start="435.44" dur="2.4">of reality</text><text start="436.08" dur="3.36">on their own well so they&apos;re taking the</text><text start="437.84" dur="3.12">view of authorities who can then be</text><text
