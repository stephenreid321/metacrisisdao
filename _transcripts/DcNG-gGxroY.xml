that so much of</text><text start="115.89" dur="3.9">what I was learning in the monastery via</text><text start="117.63" dur="4.89">Buddhism is something that goes beyond</text><text start="119.79"

dur="5.64">absolutely phenomenal for him it allows</text><text start="253.93" dur="3.54">a huge amount of mental clarity but</text><text start="256.0" dur="4.26">beyond that as you&apos;ll hear in this</text><text start="257.47" dur="5.25">episode it&apos;s doing so much more to help</text><text start="260.26" dur="4.8">you be the best version of yourself but</text><text start="262.72" dur="5.25">why is it that&apos;s kind of the theme of</text><text start="265.06" dur="4.65">this episode we talked about how given</text><text start="267.97" dur="4.02">that we are physically embodied</text><text start="269.71" dur="4.92">everything that we do is mediated</text><text start="271.99" dur="4.56">through our biology and therefore we</text><text start="274.63" dur="3.81">have a responsibility to ourselves and</text><text start="276.55" dur="3.57">to the world everything that we do to</text><text start="278.44" dur="4.89">understand that so that we can actually</text><text start="280.12" dur="5.1">be that version of ourselves put the</text><text start="283.33" dur="3.179">work out do things that help us connect</text><text start="285.22" dur="3.27">with other people and the world around</text><text start="286.509" dur="4.111">us but most of us we don&apos;t really know</text><text start="288.49" dur="4.229">how our body works and we don&apos;t have</text><text start="290.62" dur="3.24">practices and thought processes which</text><text start="292.719" dur="3.241">help us to do that</text><text start="293.86" dur="5.339">Daniel unpacks things down at the level</text><text start="295.96" dur="5.6">of the the key pillars the foundations</text><text start="299.199" dur="4.861">that we need to put in place in order to</text><text start="301.56" dur="5.56">be able to be the versions of ourselves</text><text start="304.06" dur="4.59">that we most want to be so we dig into</text><text start="307.12" dur="3.93">those foundations there&apos;s lots of</text><text start="308.65" dur="4.109">practical advice in this on how to alter</text><text start="311.05" dur="4.079">your life and effectively upgrade</text><text start="312.759" dur="4.141">yourself but we also reflect on how</text><text start="315.129" dur="4.171">difficult this is to do and to overcome</text><text start="316.9" dur="5.43">that resistance in a world or at least</text><text start="319.3" dur="4.98">in our Western societies in which the</text><text start="322.33" dur="4.5">medical system is essentially set up to</text><text start="324.28" dur="5.129">treat acute problems without really</text><text start="326.83" dur="5.399">getting down to what&apos;s causing them</text><text start="329.409" dur="5.431">which can be as simple as a nutrient or</text><text start="332.229" dur="3.84">mineral imbalance he breaks that down in</text><text start="334.84" dur="3.629">language that&apos;s so much easier to</text><text start="336.069" dur="4.32">understand than the kind of deep science</text><text start="338.469" dur="4.22">that he&apos;s actually drawing on and has a</text><text start="340.389" dur="5.011">significant amount of command over</text><text start="342.689" dur="4.931">talking about Daniel is something that I</text><text start="345.4" dur="3.69">could do at enormous length and so I&apos;m</text><text start="347.62" dur="4.32">going to cut it short here and let him</text><text start="349.09" dur="5.939">speak for himself this is an incredible</text><text start="351.94" dur="4.65">episode and from a very wise man that</text><text start="355.029" dur="3.54">was a real privilege for me to speak to</text><text start="356.59" dur="3.749">I know you&apos;re gonna love it</text><text start="358.569"

start="390.219" dur="4.861">existance podcast this is part 2</text><text start="392.65" dur="6.03">strongly advised if people want to hear</text><text start="395.08" dur="5.94">about the future of the world that they</text><text start="398.68" dur="5.07">go and listen to the first part where we</text><text start="401.02" dur="5.13">took a really macro view of where we are</text><text start="403.75" dur="6.21">as humanity and where we may be going</text><text start="406.15" dur="5.999">next and in this part we&apos;re going to</text><text start="409.96" dur="4.739">dive more into the personal development</text><text start="412.149" dur="4.591">the bio hacking the neuro hacking and</text><text start="414.699" dur="4.53">how we can develop our cell</text><text start="416.74" dur="5.579">in order to do anything positive in the</text><text start="419.229" dur="5.761">world Daniels founder @ neuro hacker</text><text start="422.319" dur="4.38">collective which is a movement dedicated</text><text start="424.99" dur="3.54">to upgrading our individual and</text><text start="426.699" dur="4.771">collective capacities and to</text><text start="428.53" dur="5.699">safeguarding the well-being of all as</text><text start="431.47" dur="4.83">you would hear in the first episode it&apos;s</text><text start="434.229" dur="4.321">pretty pretty tricky to sum up Daniel</text><text start="436.3" dur="4.73">though I guess is pretty tricky to sum</text><text start="438.55" dur="4.89">up anyone in a in a fair and rounded way</text><text start="441.03" dur="4.99">and we had a really great conversation</text><text start="443.44" dur="6.03">so welcome back and looking forward to</text><text start="446.02" dur="5.1">this second part thanks for having me</text><text start="449.47" dur="5.879">it&apos;s good to be back I really enjoyed</text><text start="451.12" dur="6.359">our last conversation so to begin in the</text><text start="455.349" dur="3.63">giving we&apos;ve already got I guess if</text><text start="457.479" dur="3.211">there were any soft questions in the</text><text start="458.979" dur="4.921">first one we had them in the first one</text><text start="460.69" dur="4.949">so we can dive right into the bigger</text><text start="463.9" dur="4.35">picture here we&apos;ll talk about qualia</text><text start="465.639" dur="4.231">which is the nootropic that have been</text><text start="468.25" dur="4.05">that&apos;s been developed by the neuro</text><text start="469.87" dur="4.019">hacker collective which is having</text><text start="472.3" dur="4.859">incredible results for many people</text><text start="473.889" dur="5.011">Martin who joined this last time was</text><text start="477.159" dur="4.051">sharing some of his own experiences</text><text start="478.9" dur="4.579">which were very positively found it very</text><text start="481.21" dur="6.03">powerful and so we&apos;ll get into that but</text><text start="483.479" dur="6.881">first at the more general level the</text><text start="487.24" dur="4.53">personal level there&apos;s a theme in your</text><text start="490.36" dur="3.839">work and it&apos;s something that a lot of</text><text start="491.77" dur="4.92">people who read how existence really</text><text start="494.199" dur="6.06">resonate with it&apos;s the idea of taking</text><text start="496.69" dur="5.219">responsibility for ourselves before we</text><text start="500.259" dur="5.871">can do anything for others</text><text start="501.909" dur="7.98">what does responsibility mean to you and</text><text start="506.13" dur="5.68">what do you think are the first steps</text><text start="509.889" dur="4.59">that anyone needs to take in terms of</text><text start="511.81" dur="4.56">personal responsibility and how perhaps</text><text start="514.479" dur="4.591">it&apos;s the first step is admitting that we</text><text start="516.37" dur="5.039">haven&apos;t been doing so how do we make</text><text start="519.07" dur="6.78">that first the first step to to find</text><text start="521.409" dur="7.321">that truth mmm-hmm well in this context</text><text start="525.85" dur="5.549">more talk about our own physical and</text><text start="528.73" dur="8.07">mental and psychological and spiritual</text><text start="531.399" dur="9.211">health and well-being ultimately if a</text><text start="536.8" dur="6.9">doctor does a good job or messes up with</text><text start="540.61" dur="5.46">a procedure or with a drug</text><text start="543.7" dur="4.079">recommendation or whatever with our</text><text start="546.07" dur="3.3">health we&apos;re going to be the ones who</text><text start="547.779" dur="6.051">benefit or suffer from it</text><text start="549.37" dur="7.53">and so we&apos;re more invested in the</text><text start="553.83" dur="4.6">medical care and the psychological care</text><text start="556.9" dur="5.33">and the health that we get than anyone</text><text start="558.43" dur="7.37">else&apos;s and so it&apos;s really a</text><text start="562.23" dur="6.88">responsibility we want to take to</text><text start="565.8" dur="4.45">understand our system well enough that</text><text start="569.11" dur="2.85">even to the degree we&apos;re interacting</text><text start="570.25" dur="2.82">with professionals that we understand</text><text start="571.96" dur="2.34">what they&apos;re saying we understand the</text><text start="573.07" dur="4.83">alternatives we understand the</text><text start="574.3" dur="9.96">consequences we understand that you know</text><text start="577.9" dur="8.94">risks and upside ratios and if we don&apos;t</text><text start="584.26" dur="5.88">and we just kind of trust an authority</text><text start="586.84" dur="5.73">to know everything about a topic and</text><text start="590.14" dur="4.44">always make good decisions for us and</text><text start="592.57" dur="4.5">then just be mad at them when they don&apos;t</text><text start="594.58" dur="5.0">it&apos;s just not a very empowered approach</text><text start="597.07" dur="4.71">and you know as soon as you realize that</text><text start="599.58" dur="5.26">we&apos;re already in an exponential</text><text start="601.78" dur="5.55">information ecology where you&apos;ve got so</text><text start="604.84" dur="4.95">many journal articles coming out on any</text><text start="607.33" dur="3.78">new topic and a clinician is a busy</text><text start="609.79" dur="4.44">person that&apos;s having to mostly see</text><text start="611.11" dur="5.07">people they can&apos;t stay up-to-date with</text><text start="614.23" dur="4.38">what is new and relevant and there&apos;s so</text><text start="616.18" dur="4.98">many kind of key breakthroughs I don&apos;t</text><text start="618.61" dur="3.99">know in the different European countries</text><text start="621.16" dur="2.94">that your listeners are in what the</text><text start="622.6" dur="4.74">stats are but in the United States right</text><text start="624.1" dur="4.98">not iatrogenic disease meaning disease</text><text start="627.34" dur="5.19">that is caused by the practice of</text><text start="629.08" dur="5.93">medicine so interactions from drugs and</text><text start="632.53" dur="5.51">complications complications from surgery</text><text start="635.01" dur="5.97">infections about in the hospitals etc is</text><text start="638.04" dur="6.1">depending upon what you include in that</text><text start="640.98" dur="7.41">is either the first leading cause of</text><text start="644.14" dur="6.96">death in the US or the third and so Wow</text><text start="648.39" dur="4.47">it&apos;s a big deal for people to realize</text><text start="651.1" dur="5.22">that and even the people who aren&apos;t</text><text start="652.86" dur="6.04">dying are mostly you know they are</text><text start="656.32" dur="5.22">experiencing side effects from other</text><text start="658.9" dur="4.5">meds or treatments they&apos;re on or they</text><text start="661.54" dur="3.69">just have sub-optimal quality of life</text><text start="663.4" dur="4.44">because the medical system is mostly not</text><text start="665.23" dur="4.58">oriented towards optimizing human</text><text start="667.84" dur="6.61">flourishing its oriented towards</text><text start="669.81" dur="8.84">treating acute illness and</text><text start="674.45" dur="7.11">so if we want to have a really richly</text><text start="678.65" dur="6.27">flourishing life in all dimensions there</text><text start="681.56" dur="4.44">are causal dynamics

dur="5.34">against them surprisingly quickly and</text><text start="733.16" dur="4.97">the a lot of I guess it&apos;s part of the</text><text start="736.55" dur="3.48">convenience of seeing so many people</text><text start="738.13" dur="2.65">they&apos;re trying to push you into a</text><text start="740.03" dur="3.96">flowchart</text><text start="740.78" dur="4.65">of expected situations and

start="746.72" dur="6.03">and that&apos;s kind of the end of the story</text><text start="748.37" dur="6.69">here I had a a junior doctor friend of</text><text start="752.75" dur="4.71">mine who gave me some cause for hope who</text><text start="755.06" dur="4.23">said that here being taught the patients</text><text start="757.46" dur="4.41">know their condition better than you do</text><text

we need to do some of</text><text start="771.65" dur="5.16">the work ourselves and go looking but</text><text start="774.2" dur="4.98">there&apos;s you know if you type almost any</text><text

mostly how can we try and</text><text start="784.76" dur="5.1">understand and what is the thing that we</text><text start="787.73" dur="4.25">should be trusting when we go looking</text><text start="789.86" dur="5.22">for it ourselves</text><text start="791.98" dur="4.51">yeah let&apos;s understand the problem space</text><text start="795.08" dur="3.2">a little bit better and then let&apos;s</text><text start="796.49" dur="5.43">understand how people can approach</text><text start="798.28" dur="5.92">empowered responsibilities well so you</text><text start="801.92" dur="3.69">said there are limits of knowledge let&apos;s</text><text start="804.2" dur="2.81">not even get to the limits of knowledge</text><text start="805.61" dur="6.17">first let&apos;s just look at the limits of</text><text start="807.01" dur="8.13">time so then way that modern medical</text><text start="811.78" dur="5.04">system in most developed nations the way</text><text start="815.14" dur="4.08">the financial structure of it works</text><text start="816.82" dur="4.35">doctors just can&apos;t afford to spend much</text><text start="819.22" dur="4.11">time with people unless it&apos;s a concierge</text><text start="821.17" dur="3.45">in practice where people are paying a</text><text start="823.33" dur="3.66">huge amount of out-of-pocket money</text><text start="824.62" dur="4.74">because that doctor racked up a</text><text start="826.99" dur="4.68">tremendous amount of student loans in</text><text start="829.36" dur="5.27">the process of learning medicine that</text><text start="831.67" dur="7.02">they have to pay back and etc right so</text><text start="834.63" dur="7.66">they if it if a doctor&apos;s seen you for</text><text start="838.69" dur="6.45">five minutes or 15 minutes and sometimes</text><text start="842.29" dur="5.4">two minutes for a health issue and</text><text start="845.14" dur="4.05">sometimes a complex health issue it&apos;s</text><text start="847.69" dur="2.97">not even the limits of knowledge that</text><text start="849.19" dur="3.54">are gonna be bumped up it&apos;s the limits</text><text start="850.66" dur="6.0">of time to be able to get enough data I</text><text start="852.73" dur="5.43">have a I have a doctor friend here I</text><text start="856.66" dur="2.94">actually think is one of the most</text><text start="858.16" dur="4.29">knowledgeable integrative</text><text start="859.6" dur="5.16">rheumatologists in the world and really</text><text start="862.45" dur="4.74">has a profound understanding of causes</text><text start="864.76" dur="4.35">of autoimmune disease but as a result</text><text start="867.19" dur="3.9">his clinic got so inundated with</text><text start="869.11" dur="3.27">incurable cases that came that he</text><text start="871.09" dur="3.63">started having shorter and shorter</text><text start="872.38" dur="4.77">sessions and then I started watching him</text><text start="874.72" dur="3.6">actually practice really poor medicine</text><text start="877.15" dur="2.97">because he only had a minute with each</text><text start="878.32" dur="3.3">person and so we didn&apos;t even get to ask</text><text start="880.12" dur="4.89">the questions that would give him a</text><text start="881.62" dur="4.8">holistic picture again so the first</text><text start="885.01" dur="3.69">thing you can be pretty sure of is that</text><text start="886.42" dur="4.56">if your doctor isn&apos;t getting a really</text><text start="888.7" dur="4.98">good sense of your whole medical history</text><text start="890.98" dur="4.86">and your symptom ology and when your</text><text start="893.68" dur="4.56">symptoms started and how that correspond</text><text start="895.84" dur="4.86">to different exposures and events that</text><text start="898.24" dur="5.85">might have happened and looking at</text><text start="900.7" dur="4.83">really you know good laboratory data and</text><text start="904.09" dur="4.53">corresponding and seeing that it makes</text><text start="905.53" dur="6.3">sense they just couldn&apos;t possibly have a</text><text start="908.62" dur="7.62">decent picture of what to do yeah I</text><text start="911.83" dur="6.0">think my doc did I try and hold on to</text><text start="916.24" dur="3.06">even as I move around the place what I</text><text start="917.83" dur="3.39">like about him as he&apos;s always running</text><text start="919.3" dur="3.75">late and he&apos;s running late because he</text><text start="921.22" dur="3.33">tries to give people the time that they</text><text start="923.05" dur="5.19">need but obviously there&apos;s knock-on</text><text start="924.55" dur="7.73">consequences for him all right so then</text><text start="928.24" dur="4.04">let&apos;s explore this a little further</text><text start="933.22" dur="5.68">conventional medicine modern Western</text><text start="936.5" dur="4.47">allopathic medicine has done a brilliant</text><text start="938.9" dur="3.99">job of saving a tremendous amount of</text><text start="940.97" dur="5.31">lives from things that we used to die</text><text start="942.89" dur="6.0">from that are mostly acute onset illness</text><text start="946.28" dur="4.76">and it&apos;s it&apos;s really an exceptional</text><text start="948.89" dur="4.43">system of medicine for acute cause</text><text start="951.04" dur="5.92">suffering so if we&apos;re talking about</text><text start="953.32" dur="5.53">injury it&apos;s not that we can&apos;t do a lot</text><text start="956.96" dur="4.5">better in the future and we will but</text><text start="958.85" dur="4.47">anybody who gets in a car accident or</text><text start="961.46" dur="6.33">gunshot would much rather go to the ER</text><text start="963.32" dur="7.59">than any other healing system and if you</text><text start="967.79" dur="4.95">have acute poisoning so dealing with</text><text start="970.91" dur="4.95">toxicity that is acute high level</text><text start="972.74" dur="4.83">toxicity or acute infection it&apos;s really</text><text start="975.86" dur="4.11">good at dealing with all that if you</text><text start="977.57" dur="4.95">have chronic complex illness that did</text><text start="979.97" dur="4.26">not come on from one acute cause so</text><text start="982.52" dur="2.97">we&apos;re looking at cancer we&apos;re looking at</text><text start="984.23" dur="2.97">autoimmune disease we look at</text><text start="985.49" dur="4.77">neurodegenerative diseases we&apos;re looking</text><text start="987.2" dur="4.65">at psychiatric disorders it&apos;s</text><text start="990.26" dur="5.87">interesting to know that there&apos;s pretty</text><text start="991.85" dur="9.99">much no actual cures for any of those</text><text start="996.13" dur="7.66">there are symptom treatments and of</text><text start="1001.84" dur="4.56">course if someone&apos;s body is running a</text><text start="1003.79" dur="5.37">cancer we can cut it out we can radiate</text><text start="1006.4" dur="4.71">it out we can poison it out and it&apos;s</text><text start="1009.16" dur="4.56">chance of coming back depending upon the</text><text start="1011.11" dur="5.48">kind of cancer is fairly high because we</text><text start="1013.72" dur="6.08">didn&apos;t actually understand why the body</text><text start="1016.59" dur="6.31">is growing cancers there in terms of why</text><text start="1019.8" dur="4.45">are cancer cells proliferating more than</text><text start="1022.9" dur="2.7">normal and why did the body&apos;s immune</text><text start="1024.25" dur="3.66">response not know how to deal with them</text><text start="1025.6" dur="5.07">effectively it&apos;s actually only in the</text><text start="1027.91" dur="5.159">last year or two with the proliferation</text><text start="1030.67" dur="4.62">of immunotherapy is that cancers</text><text start="1033.069" dur="3.87">actually starting to be looked at in a</text><text start="1035.29" dur="3.93">causal way at all chemotherapeutics</text><text start="1036.939" dur="4.65">radiation and surgery the only things</text><text start="1039.22" dur="4.59">that have been approved are exclusively</text><text start="1041.589" dur="5.161">symptomatic without addressing why the</text><text start="1043.81" dur="5.67">body&apos;s doing this same is true with all</text><text start="1046.75" dur="5.46">of those all those disorders and so one</text><text start="1049.48" dur="5.94">of the reasons is that we we don&apos;t have</text><text start="1052.21" dur="4.98">a good type of science for understanding</text><text start="1055.42" dur="6.12">in a very complex system like the human</text><text start="1057.19" dur="6.54">physiology how dis regulation works it&apos;s</text><text start="1061.54" dur="3.69">not acute if it&apos;s acute it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="1063.73" dur="2.94">easy to tell they got exposed to this</text><text start="1065.23" dur="4.05">poison</text><text start="1066.67" dur="5.67">and they got sick instantly they got it</text><text start="1069.28" dur="5.64">they you know ate this sushi and they</text><text start="1072.34" dur="6.57">got food poisoning another sick that&apos;s</text><text start="1074.92" dur="5.1">kind of straightforward but in there are</text><text start="1078.91" dur="3.5">some things where we have pretty good</text><text start="1080.02" dur="5.88">correlation like someone has you know /</text><text start="1082.41" dur="5.8">eats way too much carbohydrate and we</text><text start="1085.9" dur="3.45">see type 2 diabetes come on there&apos;s</text><text start="1088.21" dur="2.67">still a pretty straightforward</text><text start="1089.35" dur="3.27">correlation but with the other diseases</text><text start="1090.88" dur="7.08">that I mentioned they&apos;re more complex in</text><text start="1092.62" dur="7.95">origin it&apos;s because one the cause and</text><text start="1097.96" dur="4.2">effect are very separate in time we have</text><text start="1100.57" dur="5.88">time dilation which makes it very tricky</text><text start="1102.16" dur="5.52">to you have many different causes that</text><text start="1106.45" dur="3.15">are contributing to the disease</text><text start="1107.68" dur="3.6">oftentimes so it&apos;s not actually that</text><text start="1109.6" dur="4.98">there is one thing that was wrong it</text><text start="1111.28" dur="4.98">might have been some nutrient</text><text start="1114.58" dur="2.76">deficiencies and it&apos;s actually really</text><text start="1116.26" dur="3.3">important to talk about this for a</text><text start="1117.34" dur="5.54">minute when we think of nutrient</text><text start="1119.56" dur="5.58">deficiencies in modern nutritional</text><text start="1122.88" dur="5.17">Theory related to modern medical theory</text><text start="1125.14" dur="6.12">we think of again an acute level of</text><text start="1128.05" dur="5.22">deficiency such or a level of deficiency</text><text start="1131.26" dur="3.99">such that it causes that a acute disease</text><text start="1133.27" dur="4.92">so if item NC being so low that you get</text><text start="1135.25" dur="5.43">scurvy or vitamin b1 being so low you</text><text start="1138.19" dur="5.75">get berry berry well if you look at</text><text start="1140.68" dur="5.82">where an optimal level of that vitamin s</text><text start="1143.94" dur="4.27">versus where the level is at which you</text><text start="1146.5" dur="4.8">get an acute disease is a pretty big</text><text start="1148.21" dur="5.82">range in between there of suboptimal</text><text start="1151.3" dur="4.65">levels right it&apos;s not low enough yet to</text><text start="1154.03" dur="3.36">be a disease state but it&apos;s pretty far</text><text start="1155.95" dur="4.53">from where an optimally healthy person</text><text start="1157.39" dur="7.26">is yeah this is ICU in terms of</text><text start="1160.48" dur="6.93">diagnosis right and so there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="1164.65" dur="5.28">subclinical deficiency that doesn&apos;t show</text><text start="1167.41" dur="4.47">up as deficiency because in a disease</text><text start="1169.93" dur="3.39">model it&apos;s not yet causing an acute</text><text start="1171.88" dur="3.9">disease but that doesn&apos;t mean that it&apos;s</text><text start="1173.32" dur="4.77">not causing the regulatory processes of</text><text start="1175.78" dur="4.44">the body that are supported by that</text><text start="1178.09" dur="4.35">particular nutrient to regulate less</text><text start="1180.22" dur="6.18">well well if it&apos;s regulating less well</text><text start="1182.44" dur="8.09">you can start having you know all kinds</text><text start="1186.4" dur="6.81">of sub adequate regulation occur Dickens</text><text start="1190.53" dur="5.42">evangeline tube disease the same is true</text><text start="1193.21" dur="6.49">with subclinical toxicity</text><text start="1195.95" dur="5.37">so someone can have a cute let exposure</text><text start="1199.7" dur="3.03">or mercury exposure where they get sick</text><text start="1201.32" dur="3.719">right away and it&apos;s really obviously</text><text start="1202.73" dur="3.87">sick you can look at what the ideal</text><text start="1205.039" dur="2.971">level is which is there&apos;s no mercury at</text><text start="1206.6" dur="6.809">all there&apos;s a pretty big layer in</text><text start="1208.01" dur="8.85">between which is a much higher amount of</text><text start="1213.409" dur="6.661">mercury or lead or cadmium or PCBs or</text><text start="1216.86" dur="4.199">styrenes or whatever life is eight that</text><text start="1220.07" dur="3.81">would have been there in an evolutionary</text><text start="1221.059" dur="4.141">environment but not yet enough of a</text><text start="1223.88" dur="3.509">level that we would call it an acute</text><text start="1225.2" dur="4.38">poisoning or toxicity but it has an</text><text start="1227.389" dur="5.851">effect as it sometimes massive</text><text start="1229.58" dur="5.459">biological effect as a carcinogen or a</text><text start="1233.24" dur="4.86">neurologic disruptor or an occurring</text><text start="1235.039" dur="4.801">disrupter and so now imagine that we</text><text start="1238.1" dur="5.52">start stacking these right now imagine</text><text start="1239.84" dur="8.66">that we recognize that in the United</text><text start="1243.62" dur="7.649">States and I imagine it&apos;s similar in</text><text start="1248.5" dur="5.769">with a pretty big variance actually in</text><text start="1251.269" dur="5.851">different developed nations when we look</text><text start="1254.269" dur="4.951">at the breast milk mothers in the United</text><text start="1257.12" dur="6.929">States and not mothers in industrial</text><text start="1259.22" dur="6.54">areas but randomized areas we find in</text><text start="1264.049" dur="4.771">the vicinity of 200 different</text><text start="1265.76" dur="5.909">petrochemicals in the breast milk and</text><text start="1268.82" dur="5.55">this is things like volatile organic</text><text start="1271.669" dur="6.691">compounds from carpet and paint as well</text><text start="1274.37" dur="6.32">as you know styrenes from the memory</text><text start="1278.36" dur="5.01">foam bed as well as things like</text><text start="1280.69" dur="5.859">organophosphates from the

dur="6.54">manufacturing and etc and those all have</text><text start="1292.22" dur="7.38">effects so now you look at a world where</text><text start="1294.86" dur="7.71">or agriculture depletes the topsoil of</text><text start="1299.6" dur="4.919">minerals and so we and then we only put</text><text start="1302.57" dur="4.17">back in with our fertilizer just a few</text><text start="1304.519" dur="5.461">main minerals right we put NPK back in</text><text start="1306.74" dur="5.49">but we remove all of the 70 to give or</text><text start="1309.98" dur="4.919">take trace minerals so then we

dur="6.691">circle back to the question that I asked</text><text start="1533.99" dur="5.399">just a couple of minutes ago is how can</text><text start="1536.75" dur="4.919">we find the trustworthy

start="1543.679" dur="4.921">and be on top of it and there&apos;s so and</text><text start="1546.019" dur="4.321">when it&apos;s at the the below the threshold</text><text start="1548.6" dur="4.73">where it&apos;s a condition that people can</text><text start="1550.34" dur="5.25">clearly say oh you you&apos;ve got this issue</text><text start="1553.33" dur="4.569">isn&apos;t there a

just in kind of wrapping the</text><text start="1568.33" dur="4.51">major point I was trying to bring there</text><text start="1570.769" dur="5.931">is that when it comes to disease that</text><text start="1572.84" dur="6.63">doesn&apos;t have an acute cause oftentimes</text><text start="1576.7" dur="5.979">it doesn&apos;t have one cause at all it</text><text start="1579.47" dur="7.5">might be

that</text><text start="1597.46" dur="3.99">is suboptimal that makes the system</text><text start="1599.41" dur="3.87">regulate slightly less well that makes</text><text start="1601.45" dur="3.54">it more susceptible to other things that</text><text start="1603.28" dur="3.149">are suboptimal you get a vicious cycle</text><text start="1604.99" dur="3.63">and eventually there&apos;s enough</text><text start="1606.429" dur="4.591">dysregulation that you actually start to</text><text start="1608.62" dur="4.11">get damaged in certain tissues or</text><text start="1611.02" dur="3.149">certain systems and those cluster</text><text start="1612.73" dur="3.27">together and we call it a disease we</text><text start="1614.169" dur="3.811">call it MS or rheumatoid arthritis or</text><text start="1616.0" dur="5.01">whatever but the reason that we haven&apos;t</text><text start="1617.98" dur="5.189">had good cures is because we&apos;re not</text><text start="1621.01" dur="3.299">gonna find a single cause for we find a</text><text start="1623.169" dur="3.0">number of different things that</text><text start="1624.309" dur="3.541">statistically correlate but none of

it&apos;s not</text><text start="1634.6" dur="3.54">even the same set in everyone so this is</text><text start="1636.94" dur="3.3">a key thing in terms of understanding</text><text start="1638.14" dur="4.44">why we have to take a more complex</text><text start="1640.24" dur="4.5">approach to understanding something as</text><text start="1642.58" dur="5.49">complex as a human body when you&apos;re</text><text start="1644.74" dur="6.75">trying to understand issues like aging</text><text start="1648.07" dur="5.839">and issues like chronic disease and on</text><text start="1651.49"

that</text><text start="1659.59" dur="4.98">will treat it it&apos;s just not gonna work</text><text start="1661.289" dur="7.571">so that&apos;s it that&apos;s important just kind</text><text start="1664.57" dur="7.8">of from an approach point of view so how</text><text start="1668.86" dur="6.059">do we find good resources and how do we</text><text start="1672.37" dur="4.98">approach this well couple things like</text><text start="1674.919" dur="4.5">all areas there&apos;s a pretty good Pareto</text><text start="1677.35" dur="8.22">principle at 80/20 kind of principle</text><text start="1679.419" dur="8.851">here where if people do a good job with</text><text start="1685.57" dur="4.17">the foundations of well-being they&apos;re</text><text start="1688.27" dur="2.94">going to

dur="9.48">straightforward so in order</text><text start="1697.809" dur="5.881">sleep enough and sleep well that&apos;s a all</text><text start="1701.98" dur="3.84">the regeneration that happens in

the</text><text start="2145.25" dur="7.08">conventional produce so the cost really</text><text start="2147.98" dur="6.0">can be dealt with the produce is usually</text><text start="2152.33" dur="3.09">not that expensive the things that are</text><text start="2153.98" dur="5.27">expensive in places like Whole Foods</text><text start="2155.42" dur="7.02">usually are the healthy packaged

that&apos;s a way that cost is not</text><text start="2214.1" dur="5.97">a barrier of entry the other thing</text><text start="2216.41" dur="6.33">though is you know when we say solar is</text><text

parity with coal in some</text><text start="2227.48" dur="10.05">areas it&apos;s just complete nonsense</text><text start="2230.38" dur="10.24">because 99% of the cost of coal energy</text><text start="2237.53" dur="4.56">is just the coal company doesn&apos;t have to</text><text start="2240.62" dur="3.27">pay for it so they don&apos;t internalize it</text><text start="2242.09" dur="5.27">into the cost of coal it&apos;s externalized</text><text start="2243.89" dur="7.29">to the Commons in the form of co2 and</text><text start="2247.36" dur="5.489">mercury mercury vapor and nitrous

the like it there is a massive cost</text><text start="2258.099" dur="5.071">to all people to the environment to</text><text start="2260.92" dur="4.26">future generations to whatever that if</text><text start="2263.17" dur="5.579">you had to say hey burn coal but just</text><text start="2265.18" dur="5.429">don&apos;t leave the environments worse as a</text><text start="2268.749" dur="4.891">result so whatever it takes to clean up</text><text start="2270.609" dur="4.38">the effects in real time do that and if</text><text start="2273.64" dur="3.27">it costs some money to do that you have</text><text start="2274.989" dur="4.231">to include that in the cost of coal coal</text><text start="2276.91" dur="4.56">would go up by the price of coal would</text><text start="2279.22" dur="6.0">go up by hundreds or thousands of times</text><text start="2281.47" dur="6.0">and solar would have been that grid</text><text start="2285.22" dur="3.509">parity the moment it existed so and the</text><text start="2287.47" dur="5.519">same is true in health care</text><text start="2288.729" dur="7.59">I can eat shittier foods that are cheap</text><text start="2292.989" dur="5.191">but there&apos;s a cost and it&apos;s a cost</text><text start="2296.319" dur="5.22">that&apos;s being externalized to the</text><text start="2298.18" dur="5.099">decreased health of my

start="2306.819" dur="6.78">life and so it becomes important to</text><text start="2310.15" dur="7.52">think about what does cost really mean</text><text start="2313.599" dur="4.071">and what is actually worth investing in</text><text start="2317.91" dur="5.439">right yeah so cost we can think of it&apos;s</text><text start="2321.249" dur="5.461">not just a financial cost but there can</text><text start="2323.349" dur="5.551">be the other and until I think it&apos;s a</text><text start="2326.71" dur="4.829">it&apos;s a funny human thing that we tend to</text><text start="2328.9" dur="5.28">ignore that sort of personal cost until</text><text start="2331.539" dur="4.381">it actually hits us even though we have</text><text start="2334.18" dur="3.659">all the evidence to see if you see</text><text start="2335.92" dur="3.75">someone who smoked their whole lives and</text><text start="2337.839" dur="4.14">didn&apos;t think about it then the cost</text><text start="2339.67" dur="4.26">becomes evident later we say over and</text><text start="2341.979" dur="5.76">over again but seem to have trouble when</text><text start="2343.93" dur="6.389">it comes to ourselves humans

the</text><text start="2760.57" dur="4.11">research was that as people were</text><text start="2762.43" dur="5.37">relating with the older version of</text><text start="2764.68" dur="5.01">themselves because right now the idea of</text><text start="2767.8" dur="5.28">ourselves as older people is just a</text><text start="2769.69" dur="5.34">completely abstract topic but us now is</text><text

make some differences we can</text><text start="2851.98" dur="5.16">make some changes which can actually</text><text start="2854.11" dur="6.63">affect us positively and I guess one of</text><text start="2857.14" dur="6.06">the the main ones is that the conscious</text><text start="2860.74" dur="4.26">input of better things into our bodies</text><text start="2863.2" dur="5.58">in the way that you describe just in</text><text start="2865.0" dur="6.81">terms of food but when it comes to the</text><text start="2868.78" dur="6.68">world of biohacking which is ever more</text><text start="2871.81" dur="6.03">widespread it seems to me there&apos;s</text><text start="2875.46" dur="4.45">there&apos;s a lot to talk about by hacking</text><text start="2877.84" dur="3.69">I&apos;m like trying to formulate three</text><text start="2879.91" dur="4.71">questions at once I guess it&apos;d be better</text><text start="2881.53" dur="5.58">to start by saying ask for like your two</text><text start="2884.62" dur="5.72">minute description of what qualia is and</text><text start="2887.11" dur="5.82">then we can really dig deeper into it</text><text start="2890.34" dur="5.38">yeah so quality is a nootropic which</text><text start="2892.93" dur="4.44">means some chemistry that enhances</text><text start="2895.72" dur="4.47">cognitive function different aspects of</text><text start="2897.37" dur="6.36">cognitive function beyond one&apos;s previous</text><text start="2900.19" dur="6.15">baseline without causing negative side</text><text start="2903.73"

dur="5.25">we started this we saw this kind of</text><text start="2955.89" dur="7.86">meteoric exponential rise of the use of</text><text start="2959.52" dur="6.69">smart drugs and specifically even</text><text start="2963.75" dur="5.579">illegal off-label smart drugs we&apos;re</text><text start="2966.21" dur="5.73">talking about adderall modafinil riddlin</text><text start="2969.329" dur="4.77">vyvanse wellbutrin and mostly</text><text start="2971.94" dur="5.52">dopaminergic but some some other</text><text start="2974.099" dur="5.041">categories and we saw Averell do an</text><text start="2977.46" dur="6.21">estimated five billion dollars in</text><text start="2979.14" dur="7.29">illegal sales in the US per year when we</text><text start="2983.67" dur="5.119">started smart drugs as a whole - about</text><text start="2986.43" dur="4.439">15 billion dollars that&apos;s just</text><text start="2988.789" dur="7.02">domestically right so internationally a</text><text start="2990.869" dur="8.521">lot more and this is because people were</text><text start="2995.809" dur="6.04">had such strong pressure to perform and</text><text start="2999.39" dur="5.88">produce and really wanted to while</text><text start="3001.849" dur="6.631">simultaneously having so much that was</text><text start="3005.27" dur="5.43">damaging their ability to focus from all</text><text start="3008.48" dur="5.97">of the social media kinds of</text><text start="3010.7" dur="6.57">distractions to gut brain access being</text><text start="3014.45" dur="5.31">out like we talked about where 50%</text><text start="3017.27" dur="5.46">dopamine is produced and the nutrient</text><text start="3019.76" dur="6.39">and deficiencies in toxicities and etc</text><text start="3022.73" dur="6.66">and you know then other than people</text><text start="3026.15" dur="6.54">going to off-label smart drugs we also</text><text start="3029.39" dur="5.58">saw you know energy drinks where people</text><text start="3032.69" dur="4.94">were doing 300 and 400 milligrams of</text><text start="3034.97" dur="2.66">caffeine and</text><text start="3038.53" dur="4.93">you know caffeine is a cool molecule</text><text start="3041.349" dur="4.361">qualy has a very small amount of</text><text start="3043.46" dur="3.51">caffeine and a unique form in it because</text><text start="3045.71" dur="4.34">it&apos;s a really neat central nervous</text><text start="3046.97" dur="5.58">system stimulant if we have caffeine</text><text start="3050.05" dur="3.88">bound to an antioxidant from blueberry</text><text start="3052.55" dur="4.2">skin called taro still being that</text><text start="3053.93" dur="4.919">affects the pharmacokinetics of it so it</text><text start="3056.75" dur="4.44">releases much slower so you don&apos;t get a</text><text start="3058.849" dur="3.871">jolt and then a drop you get a very slow</text><text start="3061.19" dur="5.25">central nervous system release over a</text><text start="3062.72" dur="5.55">longer period of time but that is it</text><text start="3066.44" dur="4.53">also helps the uptake of some of the</text><text start="3068.27" dur="6.72">other more specifically active neural</text><text start="3070.97" dur="6.57">chemistry but at those kinds of doses</text><text start="3074.99" dur="5.76">this is really not a healthy</text><text start="3077.54" dur="5.37">relationship with caffeine and you start</text><text start="3080.75" dur="3.9">getting you know you&apos;d get increased</text><text start="3082.91" dur="4.14">focus and attention and alertness to a</text><text start="3084.65" dur="4.74">certain point and then the jitteriness</text><text start="3087.05" dur="4.68">and inability to focus starts getting a</text><text start="3089.39" dur="4.35">negative response curve and a central</text><text start="3091.73" dur="5.16">nervous system stimulant like caffeine</text><text start="3093.74" dur="5.4">or a dopamine enhancer like adderall</text><text start="3096.89" dur="4.62">are really only affecting a very narrow</text><text start="3099.14" dur="4.05">range of the total aspects of chemistry</text><text start="3101.51" dur="4.349">that are important for cognitive</text><text start="3103.19" dur="5.01">enhancement and so one of the things</text><text start="3105.859" dur="7.711">that you find is when people are going</text><text start="3108.2" dur="7.8">to those kinds of solutions is that they</text><text start="3113.57" dur="3.9">they work right like people are taking</text><text start="3116.0" dur="3.69">them for their midterms or their finals</text><text start="3117.47" dur="4.35">or their tech startup or for their</text><text start="3119.69" dur="6.0">gaming or whatever because they actually</text><text start="3121.82" dur="7.26">can focus better longer concentrate and</text><text start="3125.69" dur="5.55">they have more motivation but one of the</text><text start="3129.08" dur="4.289">things very interesting is some of the</text><text start="3131.24" dur="3.78">other cognitive capabilities that you</text><text start="3133.369" dur="2.851">would want online at the same time there</text><text start="3135.02" dur="3.15">are studies that actually show they go</text><text start="3136.22" dur="3.78">down so different aspects of memory like</text><text start="3138.17" dur="6.27">total working memory goes down on that</text><text start="3140.0" dur="6.45">role and creativity goes down and the</text><text start="3144.44" dur="6.06">ability for fluid intelligence and task</text><text start="3146.45" dur="6.57">switching goes down and it happens to be</text><text start="3150.5" dur="4.53">that empathy goes down for most people</text><text start="3153.02" dur="6.06">and irritability anxiousness</text><text start="3155.03" dur="6.0">depersonalization go up and so that&apos;s</text><text start="3159.08" dur="4.2">one problem is that it&apos;s a very narrow</text><text start="3161.03" dur="5.67">set of positive effects the other</text><text start="3163.28" dur="4.829">problem is that your body regulates</text><text start="3166.7" dur="3.149">dopamine right your nervous system</text><text start="3168.109" dur="2.251">regulates dopamine in a very kind of</text><text start="3169.849" dur="2.371">Kampala</text><text start="3170.36" dur="4.29">this way and you don&apos;t want fixed high</text><text start="3172.22" dur="3.78">dopamine levels all the time you do want</text><text start="3174.65" dur="3.33">your body to be able to up regulate its</text><text start="3176.0" dur="3.6">dopamine when you&apos;re doing and dopamine</text><text start="3177.98" dur="2.97">there&apos;s a kind of task like working on a</text><text start="3179.6" dur="3.33">project and then you want it to be able</text><text start="3180.95" dur="3.33">to chill when you want to go play with</text><text start="3182.93" dur="7.07">your kids or cuddle or something else</text><text start="3184.28" dur="8.85">and so rather than take a chemical that</text><text start="3190.0" dur="6.37">externally exogenously overrides an</text><text start="3193.13" dur="5.28">endogenous regulatory process and then</text><text start="3196.37" dur="4.2">the process of doing that it actually</text><text start="3198.41" dur="6.06">creates dependence and addiction which</text><text start="3200.57" dur="6.63">most medicines that affect the brain and</text><text start="3204.47" dur="5.07">mind end up doing we&apos;re much more</text><text start="3207.2" dur="4.85">interested in understanding how the</text><text start="3209.54" dur="6.24">regulatory process has worked and</text><text start="3212.05" dur="5.17">providing chemistry that supported the</text><text start="3215.78" dur="2.7">regulatory processes to be able to</text><text start="3217.22" dur="2.85">regulate better so that you could</text><text start="3218.48" dur="3.06">actually up regulate endogenous</text><text start="3220.07" dur="2.73">regulatory capacity because we can</text><text start="3221.54" dur="2.97">actually define health when we&apos;re</text><text start="3222.8" dur="5.91">talking about disease earlier we can</text><text start="3224.51" dur="6.39">actually define health as the robustness</text><text start="3228.71" dur="4.68">of the regulatory capacity of the system</text><text start="3230.9" dur="4.35">which means that any kind of issue can</text><text start="3233.39" dur="3.27">come up any kind of deviation from homeo</text><text start="3235.25" dur="3.81">dynamics and the system can actually</text><text start="3236.66" dur="6.21">respond to it and so we wanted to work</text><text start="3239.06" dur="5.37">on increasing the regulatory capacity of</text><text start="3242.87" dur="3.33">the system so that rather than causing</text><text start="3244.43" dur="2.91">addiction meaning the person was on it</text><text start="3246.2" dur="3.06">for a while they get off and that were</text><text start="3247.34" dur="3.81">screwed we wanted it to be that if</text><text start="3249.26" dur="4.44">someone was on any product we made for a</text><text start="3251.15" dur="6.18">while then they got off that they would</text><text start="3253.7" dur="6.27">actually have lasting benefit in terms</text><text start="3257.33" dur="4.71">of elevation of some positive functions</text><text start="3259.97" dur="4.29">from the baseline before they started</text><text start="3262.04" dur="3.6">and that&apos;s true for koala industry for</text><text start="3264.26" dur="4.89">although other products that were making</text><text start="3265.64" dur="5.64">its the design methodology and so with</text><text start="3269.15" dur="4.35">quality the way we started was we said</text><text start="3271.28" dur="3.63">okay when people are seeking cognitive</text><text start="3273.5" dur="3.21">enhancement what are they really seeking</text><text start="3274.91" dur="3.57">it&apos;s not just cognitive it&apos;s usually</text><text start="3276.71" dur="3.78">emotional cognitive psychologic</text><text start="3278.48" dur="5.19">energetic together right there they&apos;re</text><text start="3280.49" dur="6.9">seeking focus and concentration and</text><text start="3283.67" dur="5.58">attention those dynamics and memory the</text><text start="3287.39" dur="3.33">ability for working memory to hold more</text><text start="3289.25" dur="4.59">in their memory and their speed of</text><text start="3290.72" dur="5.34">recall verbal fluency you know etc and</text><text start="3293.84" dur="4.53">they want increased analytic</text><text start="3296.06" dur="4.59">capabilities and synthesis capabilities</text><text start="3298.37" dur="4.09">and creativity they also want to</text><text start="3300.65" dur="5.02">increase motivation and dry</text><text start="3302.46" dur="5.149">and emotional resilience and they also</text><text start="3305.67" dur="4.74">want some complex things that are like</text><text start="3307.609" dur="4.51">the dialectic of pretty opposite things</text><text start="3310.41" dur="4.409">which is I want the ability to</text><text start="3312.119" dur="4.71">concentrate really hard on one topic and</text><text start="3314.819" dur="4.471">not get distracted while simultaneously</text><text start="3316.829" dur="3.721">having the ability to task switch from</text><text start="3319.29" dur="4.44">one thing to another thing what I need</text><text start="3320.55" dur="6.779">to do that it&apos;s like we&apos;re asking for a</text><text start="3323.73" dur="4.889">magic pill to fix everything here well</text><text start="3327.329" dur="4.29">has nothing to do the magic pill it&apos;s</text><text start="3328.619" dur="5.94">that a well regulated system is good at</text><text start="3331.619" dur="6.21">shifting modes right like that&apos;s what</text><text start="3334.559" dur="6.151">adaptiveness is and an adaptive creature</text><text start="3337.829" dur="5.75">can go from sleeping to waking can go</text><text start="3340.71" dur="5.19">from very different kinds of states and</text><text start="3343.579" dur="4.361">the quicker that one can go between</text><text start="3345.9" dur="3.929">different modes and the better they can</text><text start="3347.94" dur="6.389">be in those modes as the adaptiveness of</text><text start="3349.829" dur="6.78">the creature and so what we wanted to</text><text start="3354.329" dur="5.071">support was the overall adaptiveness so</text><text start="3356.609" dur="5.22">if we were just driving the chemistry of</text><text start="3359.4" dur="4.83">focus and concentration</text><text start="3361.829" dur="4.651">it would make task-switching worse we</text><text start="3364.23" dur="4.319">could drive things that would support</text><text start="3366.48" dur="5.19">task switching may focus worse to make</text><text start="3368.549" dur="4.5">both better you have to not be exogenous</text><text start="3371.67" dur="2.909">lis driving the chemistry in one</text><text start="3373.049" dur="4.081">direction or the other but supporting</text><text start="3374.579" dur="5.551">the regulatory processes and so this was</text><text start="3377.13" dur="6.179">you know this is kind of at a high level</text><text start="3380.13" dur="6.179">but this is our design philosophy for</text><text start="3383.309" dur="8.101">how we wanted to approach anything in</text><text start="3386.309" dur="7.201">the health and well-being space is let&apos;s</text><text start="3391.41" dur="3.57">make sure that we are well and</text><text start="3393.51" dur="3.63">specifically in the enhancement space</text><text start="3394.98" dur="3.839">biohacking so often isn&apos;t looking at the</text><text start="3397.14" dur="5.25">disease model but the enhancement side</text><text start="3398.819" dur="4.951">and again modern medicine that&apos;s one of</text><text start="3402.39" dur="3.78">the other differences is that it is a</text><text start="3403.77" dur="8.7">disease model process so it&apos;s really not</text><text start="3406.17" dur="8.699">looking at optimization so why we mapped</text><text start="3412.47" dur="4.109">all those things to start was to say you</text><text start="3414.869" dur="4.891">know people really don&apos;t just want to</text><text start="3416.579" dur="5.911">increase focus well being more irritable</text><text start="3419.76" dur="4.92">and less creative and with less code</text><text start="3422.49" dur="5.879">Emery they want this whole suite of</text><text start="3424.68" dur="6.48">things together that means that they</text><text start="3428.369" dur="4.331">have increased creative productive</text><text start="3431.16" dur="5.919">capacity and flow</text><text start="3432.7" dur="7.7">and so then we said all right well what</text><text start="3437.079" dur="6.96">do we know in any of the various</text><text start="3440.4" dur="6.84">Biosciences human Biosciences about the</text><text start="3444.039" dur="7.98">physiologic processes that mediate those</text><text start="3447.24" dur="6.91">cognitive and subjective dynamics what</text><text start="3452.019" dur="5.451">do we know about the neural chemistry</text><text

map</text><text start="3463.15" dur="4.02">those processing some are acetylcholine</text><text start="3465.039" dur="5.25">mediated right some have to do with the</text><text start="3467.17" dur="4.889">nmda complex some have to do with how</text><text start="3470.289" dur="3.961">catecholamines process some have to do</text><text start="3472.059" dur="3.78">with sodium ion dynamic so we were</text><text start="3474.25" dur="3.359">mapping these and saying how does the</text><text start="3475.839" dur="4.43">body regulate those on its own can we</text><text start="3477.609" dur="5.371">draw the regulatory processes and then</text><text start="3480.269" dur="4.721">why does the body get less good at</text><text start="3482.98" dur="5.129">regulating because of course kids</text><text start="3484.99" dur="4.829">actually have this ability to focus on</text><text start="3488.109" dur="4.5">something they&apos;re interested in and also</text><text start="3489.819" dur="5.46">tasks which and fall asleep pretty</text><text start="3492.609" dur="5.641">quickly and then be energetic right like</text><text start="3495.279" dur="7.471">that&apos;s adaptiveness so starting to look</text><text start="3498.25" dur="6.69">at why does why does a system have</text><text start="3502.75" dur="3.96">decreased capacity to do those things</text><text start="3504.94" dur="4.29">what are the rate limiting factors in</text><text start="3506.71" dur="4.77">the system and what can we offer to</text><text start="3509.23" dur="4.71">support the system&apos;s capacity to do that</text><text start="3511.48" dur="4.859">better so like just as a for instance if</text><text start="3513.94" dur="4.109">your listeners are interested in example</text><text start="3516.339" dur="3.72">let&apos;s just say we take dopamine that</text><text start="3518.049" dur="5.82">we&apos;re talking about earlier rather than</text><text start="3520.059" dur="7.171">give you know something like an N feta</text><text start="3523.869" dur="7.44">mean right at 11:00 p.m. feta mean it is</text><text start="3527.23" dur="7.16">a enchained dopamine agonist where you</text><text

or</text><text start="3541.99" dur="3.75">anything else and it doesn&apos;t look at the</text><text start="3544.18" dur="4.02">whole process of how the body normally</text><text start="3545.74" dur="4.71">regulates dopamine so you do get down</text><text start="3548.2" dur="3.78">regulation addiction we said well how</text><text start="3550.45" dur="3.149">does the body normally do dopamine</text><text start="3551.98" dur="3.42">creation and there&apos;s this whole complex</text><text start="3553.599" dur="4.92">process of how protein is broken down</text><text start="3555.4"

down an axon</text><text start="3567.65" dur="4.33">crosses the synapse has to cross a whole</text><text start="3570.03" dur="3.9">bunch of different kinds of enzymes to</text><text start="3571.98" dur="3.93">break it down into synapse and then goes</text><text start="3573.93" dur="3.3">into one of multiple dopamine receptors</text><text start="3575.91" dur="4.44">that affect how it&apos;s processed you have</text><text start="3577.23" dur="5.52">to have the right dynamics happening in</text><text start="3580.35" dur="4.59">the cell the Krebs cycle process is to</text><text start="3582.75" dur="3.45">have enough energy to process that some</text><text start="3584.94" dur="3.42">of it will hydroxylase into</text><text start="3586.2" dur="4.35">norepinephrine you map this whole thing</text><text start="3588.36" dur="5.1">out and then say how can we support each</text><text start="3590.55" dur="4.74">step in that process and so then we have</text><text start="3593.46" dur="4.53">you know what are the vitamins what are</text><text start="3595.29" dur="5.25">the amino acids what of minerals were</text><text start="3597.99" dur="4.35">the different dynamics convert one step</text><text start="3600.54" dur="3.75">to the other step it can be at</text><text start="3602.34" dur="5.73">suboptimal levels that lead to rate</text><text start="3604.29" dur="6.75">limiting in those processes and so we</text><text start="3608.07" dur="6.3">made a database of like 500 chemicals</text><text start="3611.04" dur="5.61">that were associated with the underlying</text><text start="3614.37" dur="5.19">physiology of all of those subjective</text><text start="3616.65" dur="4.5">states and capabilities and then we</text><text start="3619.56" dur="6.33">started paring it down in terms of which</text><text start="3621.15" dur="6.54">ones are you know well tolerated and</text><text start="3625.89" dur="3.6">have positive synergies with other ones</text><text start="3627.69" dur="3.21">and don&apos;t have negative synergies and</text><text start="3629.49" dur="3.54">support each step in the various</text><text start="3630.9" dur="3.63">pathways and you know that led to an</text><text start="3633.03" dur="3.96">initial hypothesis of how to make</text><text start="3634.53" dur="6.3">something with things that we wanted to</text><text start="3636.99" dur="6.69">test do we need more or less choline</text><text start="3640.83" dur="4.92">donor in this more or less dopamine</text><text start="3643.68" dur="5.13">agonist in here etc and that led to</text><text start="3645.75" dur="6.8">about a hundred iterations with testing</text><text start="3648.81" dur="5.55">and we gave qualia and we&apos;ve done</text><text start="3652.55" dur="5.47">preclinical tests where in clinical</text><text start="3654.36" dur="5.19">trials now but we did preclinical is</text><text start="3658.02" dur="4.89">preparing for the clinicals where we did</text><text start="3659.55" dur="6.12">people&apos;s cue EEG brain scans as well as</text><text start="3662.91" dur="8.61">a bunch of biometrics like HRV and</text><text start="3665.67" dur="7.83">ethnography and etc and psychometrics</text><text start="3671.52" dur="5.79">and cognitive metrics before people took</text><text start="3673.5" dur="6.69">it and then once they did quality of</text><text start="3677.31" dur="6.24">just once and then once they were on it</text><text start="3680.19" dur="5.07">for a month and we saw really awesome</text><text start="3683.55" dur="4.44">results the data set was too small we</text><text start="3685.26" dur="4.23">only had that single blinded so I won&apos;t</text><text start="3687.99" dur="3.86">speak to the numbers yet we&apos;re gonna</text><text start="3689.49" dur="4.53">speak to him once the the full</text><text start="3691.85" dur="4.87">double-blind did large larger scale</text><text start="3694.02" dur="5.09">clinical trial comes out but you know</text><text start="3696.72" dur="4.97">and we would of course have</text><text start="3699.11" dur="4.8">dunh larger trials earlier on except</text><text start="3701.69" dur="4.71">they&apos;re expensive and yeah trying to pay</text><text start="3703.91" dur="3.96">for all of it is a tricky thing and this</text><text start="3706.4" dur="3.96">is worth like we could have taken more</text><text start="3707.87" dur="7.11">venture capital money earlier but then</text><text start="3710.36" dur="6.6">we would have been more beholden to have</text><text start="3714.98" dur="3.48">to maximize profits as per their goals</text><text start="3716.96" dur="4.83">and we really wanted to do something</text><text start="3718.46" dur="5.1">that we could really control with what</text><text start="3721.79" dur="3.21">our own capacity to fund was so that we</text><text start="3723.56" dur="4.59">could keep making the highest quality</text><text start="3725.0" dur="6.0">things so like for instance our cost of</text><text start="3728.15" dur="4.77">goods just the raw material costs for us</text><text start="3731.0" dur="5.67">on this is more expensive than the</text><text start="3732.92" dur="9.23">retail price of most metrics and it&apos;s</text><text start="3736.67" dur="7.92">because being like you know we have a</text><text start="3742.15" dur="4.75">versions of each ingredient like benefit</text><text start="3744.59" dur="4.11">I mean version of be one for the effect</text><text start="3746.9" dur="4.53">on peripheral neurons that we wanted is</text><text start="3748.7" dur="6.24">something like a hundred times more cost</text><text start="3751.43" dur="4.8">per kilo than if I mean that is the</text><text start="3754.94" dur="3.81">normal form would be one that you could</text><text start="3756.23" dur="3.48">put but we have those kind of expensive</text><text start="3758.75" dur="2.76">forms because it was the one - that</text><text start="3759.71" dur="3.06">should do what we wanted now we&apos;re</text><text start="3761.51" dur="4.53">trying to get the cost down through</text><text start="3762.77" dur="5.55">economies of scale but that was longer</text><text start="3766.04" dur="4.32">than two minutes what we were trying to</text><text start="3768.32" dur="5.7">do with quality and what it really is</text><text start="3770.36" dur="5.4">clearly a super complex I mean even</text><text start="3774.02" dur="4.26">beyond the super complexity of the</text><text start="3775.76" dur="5.55">ingredients in there it&apos;s a very complex</text><text start="3778.28" dur="6.36">and deep thinking approach that you&apos;ve</text><text start="3781.31" dur="6.33">taken so it kind of already sidesteps a</text><text start="3784.64" dur="5.01">lot of the the reservations that people</text><text start="3787.64" dur="4.67">have about biohacking and nootropics</text><text start="3789.65" dur="5.73">where there tends to be some sort of</text><text start="3792.31" dur="5.35">downside some kind of burnout element</text><text start="3795.38" dur="3.93">which you&apos;ve already said this is you</text><text start="3797.66" dur="4.29">know from the foundation up is not what</text><text start="3799.31" dur="5.49">qualia is about well I also wonder when</text><text start="3801.95" dur="5.55">when I think and people I know who try</text><text start="3804.8" dur="5.37">to take supplements to enhance their</text><text start="3807.5" dur="4.83">performance one way or another it does</text><text start="3810.17" dur="5.01">seem to still matter what it is that</text><text start="3812.33" dur="5.61">they want to do when they take it so I</text><text start="3815.18" dur="5.55">mean accrue a crude example can be you</text><text start="3817.94" dur="4.38">could take modafinil fired a pretty</text><text start="3820.73" dur="6.27">unhealthy relationship with modafinil</text><text start="3822.32" dur="7.77">for much of a year a few a few years in</text><text start="3827.0" dur="5.16">the past and after a time I realized but</text><text start="3830.09" dur="2.82">I still kept doing it that I would take</text><text start="3832.16" dur="4.29">it because I would</text><text start="3832.91" dur="5.37">feel like I was on and I felt like I&apos;m</text><text start="3836.45" dur="3.63">great I&apos;m doing great stuff I&apos;m really</text><text start="3838.28" dur="2.94">focused but if I really broke it down</text><text start="3840.08" dur="3.3">and looked at it</text><text start="3841.22" dur="4.62">I wasn&apos;t achieving anything you can take</text><text start="3843.38" dur="6.15">it to get the sensation of being on it</text><text start="3845.84" dur="5.85">but then do nothing so yeah it&apos;s is</text><text start="3849.53" dur="4.26">there does this still play a factor in</text><text start="3851.69" dur="4.5">in taking qualia because if you&apos;re if</text><text start="3853.79" dur="5.21">you&apos;re just taking it but without any</text><text start="3856.19" dur="8.07">sort of purpose in mind is that enough</text><text start="3859.0" dur="7.84">it&apos;s a tool right and there is right use</text><text start="3864.26" dur="6.0">of tools somebody can use a hammer wrong</text><text start="3866.84" dur="8.64">and break their thumb or they can use a</text><text start="3870.26" dur="6.51">hammer ray in buildings and so and to</text><text start="3875.48" dur="4.38">the other point somebody can build</text><text start="3876.77" dur="8.07">things that aren&apos;t worth building so</text><text start="3879.86" dur="7.2">those modafinil towers that I built I</text><text start="3884.84" dur="5.49">mean it&apos;s a classic thing where somebody</text><text start="3887.06" dur="5.13">is using meth and there&apos;s just cleaning</text><text start="3890.33" dur="3.48">their grout with a toothbrush because</text><text start="3892.19" dur="2.91">they have a tremendous amount of energy</text><text start="3893.81" dur="3.0">that needs to do something but they&apos;re</text><text start="3895.1" dur="7.23">not really clear on whether the super</text><text start="3896.81" dur="8.52">useful thing to do would be so if</text><text start="3902.33" dur="4.83">someone already is sleeping well is</text><text start="3905.33" dur="5.04">exercising well as meditating as dealing</text><text start="3907.16" dur="5.16">with stress well has a empowering</text><text start="3910.37" dur="4.83">outlook on life is clear on what they</text><text start="3912.32" dur="5.31">want to create and then they add qualia</text><text start="3915.2" dur="7.65">to that it&apos;s gonna be a much different</text><text start="3917.63" dur="7.35">experience than if someone is thinking</text><text start="3922.85" dur="4.59">in ways and living in ways that have</text><text start="3924.98" dur="3.75">them aggressive and scattered and etc</text><text start="3927.44" dur="3.06">and they take quality like that they&apos;re</text><text start="3928.73" dur="3.27">not going to instantly just know what to</text><text start="3930.5" dur="5.1">do with their lives because they have</text><text start="3932.0" dur="5.31">some neurochemical support so in general</text><text start="3935.6" dur="3.48">I would encourage people to do the</text><text start="3937.31" dur="3.09">foundational things before I would have</text><text start="3939.08" dur="3.75">them do any kind of more advanced</text><text start="3940.4" dur="4.2">biohacking that said there&apos;s an</text><text start="3942.83" dur="7.5">exception to that that I&apos;ve seen which</text><text start="3944.6" dur="10.02">is there are a lot of people who just</text><text start="3950.33" dur="6.63">can&apos;t do the things they know will make</text><text start="3954.62" dur="3.84">a difference for them there the habit</text><text start="3956.96" dur="3.03">patterns the addiction patterns have</text><text start="3958.46" dur="3.21">just been too strong they beat</text><text start="3959.99" dur="2.86">themselves up for not exercising but</text><text start="3961.67" dur="3.88">they just you know</text><text start="3962.85" dur="3.42">many years of wanting to and it&apos;s still</text><text start="3965.55" dur="2.49">not happening</text><text start="3966.27" dur="3.84">and we&apos;ve had a lot of people and I</text><text start="3968.04" dur="4.07">can&apos;t make any claims about this but</text><text start="3970.11" dur="5.07">we&apos;ve had many people tell us that they</text><text start="3972.11" dur="4.9">took qualia and then after years of</text><text start="3975.18" dur="3.21">wanting to exercise and not they started</text><text start="3977.01" dur="3.45">exercising or they started eating well</text><text start="3978.39" dur="3.51">or they started doing things that they</text><text start="3980.46" dur="3.33">actually felt that they had increased</text><text start="3981.9" dur="4.56">energy and motivation and capacity to do</text><text start="3983.79" dur="7.89">that they they were just overwhelming</text><text start="3986.46" dur="6.9">and daunting previously and so yeah my</text><text start="3991.68" dur="2.85">general recommendation we do the</text><text start="3993.36" dur="3.3">foundational things first</text><text start="3994.53" dur="3.6">unless there&apos;s difficulty with the</text><text

capacity to do it yeah it</text><text start="4002.06" dur="6.08">sounds a bit like some of the effects of</text><text start="4004.85" dur="5.55">a regular meditation practice where you</text><text start="4008.14" dur="4.81">certainly in my experience I end up</text><text start="4010.4" dur="5.31">finding that there&apos;s more sort of space</text><text start="4012.95" dur="5.34">and energy and capacity in myself to set</text><text start="4015.71" dur="5.49">about doing things that I want to do but</text><text start="4018.29" dur="5.52">usually provoke a kind of it feels like</text><text

in a way the thing the</text><text start="4031.28" dur="4.26">is causing you so much stress and grief</text><text start="4033.74" dur="4.02">you keep looking in the other direction</text><text

start="4134.91" dur="5.19">because having shitty energy and</text><text start="4137.91" dur="4.59">unstable mood and inflammation is less</text><text start="4140.1" dur="5.87">pleasure but then when your pleasure is</text><text start="4142.5" dur="6.06">low you and you&apos;re feeling really shitty</text><text start="4145.97" dur="4.329">then you crave anything that will make</text><text start="4148.56" dur="3.57">you feel better again in the moment so</text><text start="4150.299" dur="6.901">that that that&apos;s the addiction cycle</text><text start="4152.13" dur="6.66">right and so in blood sugar is a classic</text><text start="4157.2" dur="3.27">example you take something that spikes</text><text start="4158.79" dur="3.69">your blood sugar you feel really good</text><text start="4160.47" dur="3.27">but then it also crashes your blood</text><text start="4162.48" dur="3.72">sugar then once your blood Sugar&apos;s</text><text start="4163.74" dur="4.41">crashed you&apos;re kind of desperate and so</text><text start="4166.2" dur="4.02">you will go for sugary things it will</text><text start="4168.15" dur="4.26">raise it again when have you eaten</text><text start="4170.22" dur="3.329">something that wasn&apos;t sugary earlier you</text><text start="4172.41" dur="3.42">would have never had your blood sugar</text><text start="4173.549" dur="5.631">crash in the first place and been stable</text><text start="4175.83" dur="6.48">so the addiction cycle is a cycle of</text><text start="4179.18" dur="5.32">hyper stimulus the dis regulates</text><text start="4182.31" dur="6.81">baseline that leads to more desire for</text><text start="4184.5" dur="6.66">hyper stimulus right yeah and it&apos;s</text><text start="4189.12" dur="3.9">possible to have some of that attitude</text><text start="4191.16" dur="4.11">towards exercise if you get on the</text><text start="4193.02" dur="4.95">exercise wagon but then that also can</text><text start="4195.27" dur="4.71">lead to an addiction the over exercise</text><text start="4197.97" dur="5.12">because you&apos;re getting your kick but</text><text start="4199.98" dur="5.76">probably still avoiding something</text><text start="4203.09" dur="4.45">okay so I&apos;ll get to that in a minute but</text><text start="4205.74" dur="3.54">let me tell the other part of this food</text><text start="4207.54" dur="3.929">analogy because then we&apos;ll be able to</text><text start="4209.28" dur="4.05">relate it so</text><text start="4211.469" dur="4.711">let&apos;s say instead of the chocolate cake</text><text start="4213.33" dur="4.74">I&apos;m looking at eating a salad the salad</text><text start="4216.18" dur="3.3">is not gonna give me the same dopamine</text><text start="4218.07" dur="5.34">flood in the moment the chocolate cake</text><text start="4219.48" dur="6.06">did even if it&apos;s a good salad right for</text><text start="4223.41" dur="7.67">the fat sugar salt reasons we mentioned</text><text start="4225.54" dur="10.14">earlier and that said as I&apos;m doing the</text><text start="4231.08" dur="6.88">salads regularly I will have a body that</text><text start="4235.68" dur="4.41">is more mobile that has more energy that</text><text start="4237.96" dur="4.739">has less fatigue that has less blood</text><text start="4240.09" dur="4.92">sugar crashes it has less excessive</text><text start="4242.699" dur="5.881">weight and that all translates to a body</text><text start="4245.01" dur="7.2">whose baseline pleasure is higher right</text><text start="4248.58" dur="6.0">and so the opposite of the addiction</text><text start="4252.21" dur="4.62">cycle is something that does not spike</text><text start="4254.58" dur="5.76">your pleasure</text><text start="4256.83" dur="5.61">but that doesn&apos;t destabilize and</text><text start="4260.34" dur="5.22">decrease your baseline and that leads to</text><text start="4262.44" dur="6.509">slowly up regulating baseline and so</text><text start="4265.56" dur="6.72">here&apos;s the the difference addictive</text><text start="4268.949" dur="5.011">things spike your pleasure and then</text><text start="4272.28" dur="4.83">crash it and then it spikes then it</text><text start="4273.96" dur="4.89">crashes but the baseline lowers two</text><text start="4277.11" dur="4.17">things you both get more highs and lows</text><text start="4278.85" dur="4.65">and progressively more lows in the</text><text start="4281.28" dur="6.24">addiction cycle in the healthy cycle</text><text start="4283.5" dur="6.8">with anything you get less extreme highs</text><text start="4287.52" dur="5.55">and lows and progressively more highs</text><text start="4290.3" dur="4.66">right that&apos;s a kind of difference in the</text><text start="4293.07" dur="4.2">relationship and so what&apos;s interesting</text><text start="4294.96" dur="3.96">is while the addict is controlled by</text><text start="4297.27" dur="5.1">pleasure they actually have much less</text><text start="4298.92" dur="7.67">pleasure in their life right because the</text><text start="4302.37" dur="9.21">baseline is is very different right and</text><text start="4306.59" dur="6.64">so when we&apos;re talking about what is</text><text start="4311.58" dur="3.03">healthy we&apos;re actually also talking</text><text start="4313.23" dur="6.93">about what is more pleasurable</text><text start="4314.61" dur="7.44">now you mentioned exercise and you</text><text start="4320.16" dur="6.75">mentioned it as a addiction and also has</text><text start="4322.05" dur="7.14">an avoidance can someone exercise</text><text start="4326.91" dur="3.72">because they hate their body and they&apos;re</text><text start="4329.19" dur="3.27">fat and disgusting and they need to</text><text start="4330.63" dur="5.37">exercise as almost like a form of</text><text start="4332.46" dur="5.009">bulimia right yeah totally I can eat and</text><text start="4336.0" dur="5.34">throw up or I can eat and then go</text><text start="4337.469" dur="7.011">exercise body hatred now</text><text start="4341.34" dur="7.02">is is that radically different than</text><text start="4344.48" dur="5.59">being grateful to be alive and get to</text><text start="4348.36" dur="3.93">create and have experience and that all</text><text start="4350.07" dur="3.57">of that only gets to happen because I</text><text start="4352.29" dur="2.76">have a body and so I want to take good</text><text start="4353.64" dur="2.85">care of this vessel that I&apos;m in yeah</text><text start="4355.05" dur="5.12">it&apos;s a totally different motivation</text><text start="4356.49" dur="5.76">right and one of them happens after</text><text start="4360.17" dur="4.0">binging and one of them happens just</text><text start="4362.25" dur="4.41">because it&apos;s a good thing to do and you</text><text start="4364.17" dur="4.2">know and one might happen so that I can</text><text start="4366.66" dur="4.19">avoid feeling certain things and the</text><text start="4368.37" dur="5.37">other one is happening just to support</text><text start="4370.85" dur="5.68">feeling good in my body so the</text><text start="4373.74" dur="5.55">motivation and how one relates to</text><text start="4376.53" dur="5.22">anything can determine sex can be</text><text start="4379.29" dur="5.52">addictive or it can be healthy and</text><text start="4381.75" dur="4.83">healing meditation can be actually a way</text><text start="4384.81" dur="5.16">to avoid dealing with real in one&apos;s</text><text start="4386.58" dur="6.54">life yeah some people just get that and</text><text start="4389.97" dur="6.15">float tanks as well it can they can be</text><text start="4393.12" dur="5.43">incredibly powerful tools again tools or</text><text start="4396.12" dur="4.71">if you spend like 10 hours a day and a</text><text start="4398.55" dur="6.21">float tank what what exactly are you</text><text start="4400.83" dur="10.88">doing that for well I see so many people</text><text start="4404.76" dur="9.87">who will pray for world peace and not do</text><text start="4411.71" dur="8.98">anything that actually tangibly makes</text><text start="4414.63" dur="11.31">the world better and you know in a way</text><text start="4420.69" dur="9.06">that is worse than not doing because it</text><text start="4425.94" dur="5.19">if they didn&apos;t do it the pain of not</text><text start="4429.75" dur="3.38">contributing to what they cared about</text><text start="4431.13" dur="6.36">might make them find something actually</text><text start="4433.13" dur="5.89">you know tangible they could do but the</text><text start="4437.49" dur="2.67">reason they do that is because they</text><text start="4439.02" dur="3.36">don&apos;t know what the to do about</text><text start="4440.16" dur="4.14">climate change or about species</text><text start="4442.38" dur="3.78">extinction it&apos;s too painful and they</text><text start="4444.3" dur="4.5">can&apos;t do nothing and so that&apos;s something</text><text start="4446.16" dur="7.94">they feel like they can do but it is</text><text start="4448.8" dur="9.32">then importantly kind of a avoidance of</text><text start="4454.1" dur="7.9">something rain the bypass of something</text><text start="4458.12" dur="5.98">yeah exactly yeah there&apos;s I&apos;m wondering</text><text start="4462.0" dur="5.0">when so individual motivation is</text><text start="4464.1" dur="6.93">important too but then we also have</text><text start="4467.0" dur="6.48">individual biology and I wondered even</text><text start="4471.03" dur="4.109">if you&apos;ve tried to create the most</text><text start="4473.48" dur="4.469">rounded</text><text start="4475.139" dur="5.671">product in qualia

night where</text><text start="4497.34" dur="5.76">you are early morning I&apos;m like my I feel</text><text start="4501.239" dur="4.951">like I&apos;m definitely a very low capacity</text><text start="4503.1" dur="6.69">when I end up in like the the late night</text><text start="4506.19" dur="5.07">is that something that can just an</text><text start="4509.79" dur="3.54">example I guess of something that we</text><text start="4511.26" dur="6.27">can&apos;t really change at the individual</text><text start="4513.33" dur="7.2">level all right that was a few different</text><text start="4517.53" dur="5.55">questions that I heard one is an is</text><text start="4520.53" dur="4.47">qualia appropriate for everyone or do we</text><text start="4523.08" dur="4.5">need personalized chemistry and then are</text><text start="4525.0" dur="5.55">there things that we can&apos;t change with</text><text start="4527.58" dur="5.22">our physiology and that needs to be</text><text start="4530.55" dur="3.72">personalized so on the topic of</text><text start="4532.8" dur="3.21">personalization first with word equality</text><text start="4534.27" dur="3.9">its quality of the right chemistry for</text><text start="4536.01" dur="4.229">everyone totally not it was the best</text><text start="4538.17" dur="4.71">that we could do at making something</text><text start="4540.239" dur="5.161">that worked for worked well for the most</text><text start="4542.88" dur="3.96">people interested in that thing and it</text><text start="4545.4" dur="4.29">was actually much better than I thought</text><text start="4546.84" dur="5.31">we&apos;d be able to do because you know my</text><text start="4549.69" dur="4.67">background and starting to explore it</text><text start="4552.15" dur="7.259">was based on full personalization so</text><text start="4554.36" dur="8.44">working in integrative medical clinics</text><text start="4559.409" dur="6.681">with you know different kinds of</text><text start="4562.8" dur="4.53">innovative doctors helping design</text><text start="4566.09" dur="2.799">customized</text><text start="4567.33" dur="4.619">chemistry and neural chemistry support</text><text start="4568.889" dur="6.181">but we got to actually see people&apos;s labs</text><text start="4571.949" dur="5.431">see their qejy have the medical history</text><text start="4575.07" dur="4.41">and and so I got to see how much we</text><text start="4577.38" dur="3.989">could actually help people feel</text><text start="4579.48" dur="3.42">radically better not just in terms of</text><text start="4581.369" dur="4.921">cognitive enhancement but in terms of</text><text start="4582.9" dur="7.92">their psychological being and yeah all</text><text start="4586.29" dur="9.3">that I wasn&apos;t sure what we would be able</text><text start="4590.82" dur="5.85">to do without personalization and I was</text><text start="4595.59" dur="2.01">really curious because if there were</text><text start="4596.67" dur="2.819">things that we could do that were</text><text start="4597.6" dur="3.119">meaningful to wide audiences that</text><text start="4599.489" dur="3.871">obviously would allow us to bring</text><text start="4600.719" dur="4.291">support to a lot more people and the</text><text start="4603.36" dur="2.9">cost of the personalization work was so</text><text start="4605.01" dur="2.359">prohibitive</text><text start="4606.26" dur="5.669">[Music]</text><text start="4607.369" dur="8.85">so we were able to find that with there</text><text start="4611.929" dur="6.75">are certain axes that are so sensitive</text><text start="4616.219" dur="5.701">one person to the next or a different</text><text start="4618.679" dur="5.881">kind of genetic clusters different</text><text start="4621.92" dur="3.96">phenotypes that I just don&apos;t include</text><text start="4624.56" dur="2.369">them in quality of won&apos;t use them in any</text><text start="4625.88" dur="3.54">of our products so like for instance</text><text start="4626.929" dur="5.79">you&apos;ll see we don&apos;t have folic acid</text><text start="4629.42" dur="5.549">because whether you use folic acid or</text><text start="4632.719" dur="6.061">you use some version of methylated folic</text><text start="4634.969" dur="5.551">acid is there are so many people in each</text><text start="4638.78" dur="5.129">of the groups and it makes such a big</text><text start="4640.52" dur="5.52">difference whether they are over or</text><text start="4643.909" dur="3.421">under methylating on that particular</text><text start="4646.04" dur="4.07">axis that is just something without</text><text start="4647.33" dur="5.579">personalization I don&apos;t mess with</text><text start="4650.11" dur="6.239">because I because I couldn&apos;t actually do</text><text start="4652.909" dur="6.21">it for a wide audience effectively and</text><text start="4656.349" dur="4.961">so we work with axes that are pretty</text><text start="4659.119" dur="3.691">commonly supported by the same things</text><text start="4661.31" dur="3.72">for everybody the right krebs

those</text><text start="4684.8" dur="4.379">are the ones that we work with now there</text><text start="4686.599" dur="5.64">are still you know there&apos;s something</text><text start="4689.179" dur="6.531">like 80% of the people that have tried</text><text start="4692.239" dur="5.701">quality of it had a good response and</text><text start="4695.71" dur="4.69">felt that it was meaningful for

they are</text><text start="5039.11" dur="5.7">gonna wake up whatever time their kids</text><text start="5040.31" dur="6.81">come in so lots of lots of reasons there</text><text start="5044.81" dur="7.38">but I will say getting enough sleep is</text><text start="5047.12" dur="7.25">critical and in general also getting</text><text start="5052.19" dur="6.9">enough light during the day is critical</text><text start="5054.37" dur="9.34">and most people like I said do better if</text><text start="5059.09" dur="8.34">they&apos;re waking up with with sunlight so</text><text start="5063.71" dur="5.31">waking up in the dawn vicinity and then</text><text start="5067.43" dur="3.42">getting an earlier bed and a regular</text><text start="5069.02" dur="4.05">bedtime those are the general starting</text><text start="5070.85" dur="6.39">recommendations that any sleep expert</text><text start="5073.07" dur="7.08">will give you and and then like I said</text><text start="5077.24" dur="5.61">some percentage of the people will find</text><text start="5080.15" dur="5.76">that they do better or have personal</text><text start="5082.85" dur="4.86">reasons like you said to do otherwise so</text><text start="5085.91" dur="3.54">again we&apos;re back to the importance of</text><text start="5087.71" dur="5.04">sleep in and of itself and we also</text><text start="5089.45" dur="6.87">talked about how to get better nutrition</text><text start="5092.75" dur="5.55">into our bodies when it comes to the the</text><text start="5096.32" dur="3.72">other element that can make

dur="6.45">mentioned and for those possibly</text><text start="5104.93" dur="6.03">including me what are there some basic</text><text start="5108.74" dur="4.68">steps to get a sense of if there is a</text><text start="5110.96" dur="5.67">problem in the microbiome and what can</text><text start="5113.42" dur="5.43">be done short of going into a specialist</text><text start="5116.63" dur="4.71">lab which I think in most cases is not</text><text start="5118.85" dur="6.05">immediately available or affordable are</text><text start="5121.34" dur="3.56">there some steps that we can take</text><text start="5127.179" dur="7.52">yeah so for most people there are</text><text start="5132.34" dur="4.95">dietary things they can do that will</text><text start="5134.699" dur="5.351">help their gut if they notice that they</text><text start="5137.29" dur="4.77">are having GI symptoms they&apos;re having</text><text start="5140.05" dur="4.22">gas or bloating or tenderness in their</text><text start="5142.06" dur="7.23">abdomen or constipation or diarrhea or</text><text start="5144.27" dur="8.08">upper GI issues acidity etc it gets</text><text start="5149.29" dur="6.72">complex and the you know the allopathic</text><text start="5152.35" dur="6.3">answer is to say you have IBD and which</text><text start="5156.01" dur="5.61">can&apos;t you so many things not that that&apos;s</text><text start="5158.65" dur="5.22">not that descriptive or useful right be</text><text start="5161.62" dur="4.2">integrative approaches to the function</text><text start="5163.87" dur="3.69">medicine approaches to try and figure</text><text start="5165.82" dur="4.79">out what&apos;s going on and is it a food</text><text start="5167.56" dur="6.78">allergy is it

start="5176.14" dur="3.57">that the tests have a lot of false</text><text start="5178.21" dur="3.92">negatives so it&apos;s kind of tricky to</text><text start="5179.71" dur="2.42">figure it out</text><text start="5182.429" dur="6.841">so the foundational things one can do</text><text start="5186.659" dur="4.871">someone can do an elimination diet and</text><text start="5189.27" dur="5.199">you can read online at how to do an</text><text start="5191.53" dur="5.22">elimination diet where you eliminate the</text><text start="5194.469" dur="5.491">foods that people commonly

different</text><text start="5211.989" dur="4.771">things you can eliminate and then after</text><text start="5214.69" dur="3.93">you know some period of time off of them</text><text start="5216.76" dur="3.689">see do their symptoms get better if so</text><text start="5218.62" dur="3.809">then reintroduce the foods one at a time</text><text start="5220.449" dur="3.601">see which one kicks the symptoms on and</text><text start="5222.429" dur="4.171">you start to get some insight this is a</text><text start="5224.05" dur="5.55">way people can experiment on their own</text><text start="5226.6" dur="4.29">with what foods your bothersome the ones</text><text start="5229.6" dur="3.69">I mentioned are ones that are</text><text start="5230.89" dur="6.84">classically bothersome for a lot of</text><text start="5233.29" dur="7.11">people and there are people who have bad</text><text start="5237.73" dur="7.53">GI reactions to plants to have leptin</text><text start="5240.4" dur="9.79">sensitivities but you know the gluten</text><text start="5245.26" dur="8.65">thing is obviously a very heated</text><text start="5250.19" dur="7.56">controversial difficult topic for the</text><text start="5253.91" dur="6.809">most part the gluten sensitivity the</text><text start="5257.75" dur="5.19">food insensitive thing is not just a</text><text start="5260.719" dur="7.111">marketing ploy and/or like a some weird</text><text start="5262.94" dur="9.75">fad it is largely the result of Ubiquiti</text><text start="5267.83" dur="6.69">IFAs 8 use on wheat and so it&apos;s not</text><text start="5272.69" dur="5.25">actually gluten itself it&apos;s this</text><text start="5274.52" dur="5.16">associated dynamic there&apos;s a law we</text><text start="5277.94" dur="4.5">could get into there and there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="5279.68" dur="4.769">of books that are critiquing grains and</text><text start="5282.44" dur="4.279">why there are problems with grains the</text><text start="5284.449" dur="6.091">paleo world is pretty big into this</text><text start="5286.719" dur="6.401">where people can study further but there</text><text

does</text><text start="5301.52" dur="5.13">have to do with different agricultural</text><text start="5302.719" dur="6.211">methods in different countries so again</text><text start="5306.65" dur="5.339">you can explore that topic but cutting</text><text start="5308.93" dur="4.5">out hard to digest foods and foods you</text><text start="5311.989" dur="5.541">might be reacting to and

dur="5.25">is not overeating it&apos;s kind of a major</text><text start="5323.449" dur="3.54">step people are gonna have GI issues if</text><text start="5325.64" dur="3.23">they&apos;re overeating or

dur="7.05">distracted and the the mechanical part</text><text start="5341.42" dur="5.45">of digestion the actual chewing</text><text start="5343.07" dur="5.97">investigation is really critical for the</text><text start="5346.87" dur="5.349">chemical part of digestion to come later</text><text start="5349.04" dur="5.13">because the acid and the enzymes are not</text><text start="5352.219"

one answer that&apos;s related to</text><text start="5729.98" dur="6.36">something we talked about today which</text><text start="5731.719" dur="8.88">was you were asking the question of can</text><text start="5736.34" dur="7.52">we enhance certain capabilities without</text><text start="5740.599" dur="6.781">detracting from other ones can we</text><text start="5743.86" dur="7.589">increase our ability to focus on a task</text><text start="5747.38" dur="4.069">and do task switching simultaneously</text><text start="5753.369" dur="7.48">we&apos;re we&apos;re used to doing a lot of</text><text start="5758.27" dur="5.73">theory of trade-offs in our life where</text><text start="5760.849" dur="6.241">at all scales what&apos;s good for one</text><text start="5764.0" dur="5.79">country is bad for another country in</text><text start="5767.09" dur="4.14">terms of war particular trade agreement</text><text start="5769.79" dur="2.88">or whatever what&apos;s good for

one aspect of life is</text><text start="5788.06" dur="6.74">actually damaging other aspects of life</text><text start="5790.21" dur="6.58">the the proposal that we&apos;re voting on is</text><text

and so people</text><text start="5800.27" dur="8.0">who care about one side cluster here</text><text start="5802.82" dur="8.85">those a cluster there as much as we can</text><text start="5808.27" dur="5.92">get over decision making based on</text><text start="5811.67" dur="4.65">unnecessary dichotomy is an unnecessary</text><text start="5814.19" dur="4.55">theory of trade-offs and say how can we</text><text start="5816.32" dur="4.2">factor everything that is connected to</text><text start="5818.74" dur="3.27">it all the things that are</text><text start="5820.52" dur="4.41">interconnected to a particular decision</text><text start="5822.01" dur="5.92">that are meaningful and enhance them all</text><text start="5824.93" dur="7.02">simultaneously right enhance across</text><text start="5827.93" dur="6.93">dialectics simultaneously so is there a</text><text start="5831.95" dur="4.65">way to help the economy make jobs and</text><text start="5834.86" dur="4.38">make the environment better rather than</text><text start="5836.6" dur="5.13">jobs or the environment well there are</text><text start="5839.24" dur="4.32">and if you require that you find</text><text start="5841.73" dur="3.69">something that does both life is gonna</text><text start="5843.56" dur="4.92">be radically better can we find</text><text start="5845.42" dur="7.38">something that helps task switching and</text><text start="5848.48" dur="7.56">focus yes and now that starts to extend</text><text start="5852.8" dur="5.49">to everything can I live my life in a</text><text start="5856.04" dur="3.78">way that is actually enjoyable now and</text><text start="5858.29" dur="2.61">that leads to a progressively more</text><text start="5859.82" dur="5.91">enjoyable future</text><text start="5860.9" dur="7.5">yes can I figure out how to increase my</text><text start="5865.73" dur="4.74">gratitude what is while simultaneously</text><text start="5868.4" dur="5.91">increasing my motivation to make things</text><text start="5870.47" dur="6.39">better yes so all of the dichotomies</text><text start="5874.31" dur="3.87">where we will typically enhance one</text><text start="5876.86" dur="6.45">thing at the cost of something else</text><text start="5878.18" dur="6.93">meaningful you know we could say a high</text><text start="5883.31" dur="4.35">existence is being high in any</text><text start="5885.11" dur="4.89">particular area but most of the things</text><text start="5887.66" dur="4.2">that people would try to make higher</text><text start="5890.0" dur="5.19">they would try to optimize would be at</text><text start="5891.86" dur="5.55">the expense of something else in the in</text><text start="5895.19" dur="4.94">the tree that previous way of thinking</text><text start="5897.41" dur="5.97">about it so high across all domains</text><text start="5900.13" dur="4.72">simultaneously because we&apos;re thinking</text><text start="5903.38" dur="5.43">about the interconnectedness of all of</text><text start="5904.85" dur="5.49">it and supporting the entire picture or</text><text start="5908.81" dur="3.99">consciously</text><text start="5910.34" dur="7.2">is that one meaningful way to think</text><text start="5912.8" dur="7.799">about hi existence yeah I think that&apos;s</text><text start="5917.54" dur="4.889">the most healthy way in which to try and</text><text start="5920.599" dur="3.241">approach it that we live in so many</text><text start="5922.429" dur="5.04">times we seem to think we&apos;re we&apos;re</text><text start="5923.84" dur="5.1">living in a world of zero-sum games but</text><text start="5927.469" dur="3.571">what I like the what you&apos;re emphasizing</text><text start="5928.94" dur="4.86">which is that if we begin from the</text><text start="5931.04" dur="4.349">premise of how can we find the best</text><text start="5933.8" dur="3.54">thing that includes all of these</text><text start="5935.389" dur="4.02">elements rather than thinking I just</text><text start="5937.34" dur="4.649">want to go down one particular
