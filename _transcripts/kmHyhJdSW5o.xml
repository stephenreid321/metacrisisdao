start="4.56" dur="4.77">type phenomena just built into</text><text start="5.97" dur="5.1">algorithms can let alone the social</text><text start="9.33" dur="4.5">travel type dynamics that are made</text><text start="11.07" dur="5.37">easier not in person lead to echo</text><text start="13.83" dur="3.99">chambers where people think that most</text><text start="16.44" dur="3.44">everyone believes kind of the way they</text><text start="17.82" dur="4.44">do because that&apos;s what they&apos;re seeing</text><text start="19.88" dur="4.989">except those bad guys over there that</text><text start="22.26" dur="5.4">are far that are far enough away that</text><text start="24.869" dur="5.58">they only get the caricature eyes</text><text start="27.66" dur="6.57">version of them and so you know I&apos;ve</text><text start="30.449" dur="5.931">intentionally I still use Facebook and I</text><text start="34.23" dur="4.98">actually use it largely as a tool for</text><text start="36.38" dur="7.179">understanding social phenomena and so</text><text start="39.21" dur="7.2">I&apos;ve intentionally followed made friends</text><text start="43.559" dur="5.25">with and followed people on every side</text><text start="46.41" dur="3.84">of every political topic who are leading</text><text start="48.809" dur="5.91">thinkers that other people pay attention</text><text start="50.25" dur="7.079">to and so of course I&apos;ll have a thread</text><text start="54.719" dur="4.531">where there are some all right type</text><text start="57.329" dur="4.05">people who are commenting we&apos;re then</text><text start="59.25" dur="3.96">left people think that I have become a</text><text start="61.379" dur="4.891">Nazi or at least a Nazi supporter and</text><text start="63.21" dur="4.68">then decide to unfriend me and of course</text><text start="66.27" dur="6.029">then more conservatively oriented people</text><text start="67.89" dur="6.93">will see further Left perspectives in my</text><text start="72.299" dur="6.331">thread talking about LGBTQ rights or</text><text start="74.82" dur="9.54">whatever it is and think that I am a</text><text start="78.63" dur="8.879">whatever pejorative you know call me etc</text><text start="84.36" dur="6.09">type thing that they think and I&apos;m just</text><text start="87.509" dur="7.021">actively trying to see what the various</text><text start="90.45" dur="5.669">groups in the world think because if I</text><text start="94.53" dur="4.74">don&apos;t understand why it&apos;s compelling</text><text start="96.119" dur="4.68">like if I don&apos;t understand the partial</text><text start="99.27" dur="2.61">truths and the values that they care</text><text start="100.799" dur="2.581">about I don&apos;t have a chance of</text><text start="101.88" dur="3.419">understanding reality and if I don&apos;t</text><text start="103.38" dur="3.33">understand even beyond that why it&apos;s</text><text start="105.299" dur="3.631">compelling I don&apos;t have a chance of</text><text start="106.71" dur="4.07">possibly engaging in a constructive or</text><text start="108.93" dur="3.899">meaningful way so all I can do is</text><text start="110.78" dur="4.449">villainize them and engage in warfare</text><text start="112.829" dur="6.57">and then to various degrees win or lose</text><text start="115.229" dur="5.881">but to some degree all lose and like</text><text start="119.399" dur="3.811">that&apos;s a very very simple thing I would</text><text start="121.11" dur="3.75">suggest everyone do if you tend to be</text><text start="123.21" dur="3.24">left-leaning and most of your friends</text><text start="124.86" dur="3.179">kind of agree with you about climate</text><text start="126.45" dur="4.8">change or abortion rights or whatever I</text><text start="128.039" dur="7.241">would actually really like you to find</text><text start="131.25" dur="7.42">mmm follow Ben Shapiro follow the proper</text><text start="135.28" dur="6.84">terian Institute follow you know very</text><text start="138.67" dur="6.69">follow Heritage Foundation and Cato</text><text start="142.12" dur="7.53">Institute and whatever and actually seek</text><text start="145.36" dur="6.59">to understand both where they&apos;re sharing</text><text start="149.65" dur="6.809">things that you actually didn&apos;t know and</text><text start="151.95" dur="6.85">even where you really disagree why it&apos;s</text><text start="156.459" dur="6.271">compelling with an answer that isn&apos;t</text><text start="158.8" dur="5.61">just because they&apos;re all stupid because</text><text start="162.73" dur="4.8">you actually don&apos;t have any chance of</text><text start="164.41" dur="5.22">healing a culture war otherwise you only</text><text start="167.53" dur="3.48">have a chance of engaging in it and if</text><text start="169.63" dur="3.24">someone happens to be more right</text><text start="171.01" dur="4.62">oriented and of course saying right left</text><text start="172.87" dur="5.19">is itself over simplified but we&apos;ll use</text><text start="175.63" dur="4.079">that as a simplification for all of the</text><text start="178.06" dur="3.12">perspectives that are engaged in some</text><text start="179.709" dur="3.241">kind of warfare that actually need to be</text><text start="181.18" dur="6.27">engaged in some kind of more generative</text><text start="182.95" dur="6.93">dialectical conversation study</text><text start="187.45" dur="6.11">intersectionality like follow some of</text><text start="189.88" dur="7.35">the thinkers that are actually giving</text><text start="193.56" dur="5.08">arguments for and history for why some</text><text start="197.23" dur="2.7">of that&apos;s important actually read some</text><text start="198.64" dur="3.06">of the postmodern thinkers</text><text start="199.93" dur="3.54">read Foucault and Derrida on whatever</text><text start="201.7" dur="3.84">before just saying all post-modernism is</text><text start="203.47" dur="4.31">stupid and again look to see are their</text><text start="205.54" dur="4.62">true insights and critiques in there and</text><text start="207.78" dur="6.61">can you factor them to understand them</text><text start="210.16" dur="5.79">and even where you don&apos;t think they&apos;re</text><text start="214.39" dur="5.37">true can you see why they&apos;re compelling</text><text start="215.95" dur="5.849">and so that&apos;s a very very easy step so</text><text start="219.76" dur="3.479">I&apos;m speaking to why it&apos;s important</text><text start="221.799" dur="5.341">because I think that we have more issues</text><text start="223.239" dur="5.601">in the world today from now weaponized</text><text start="227.14" dur="4.56">drones actually available for sale</text><text start="228.84" dur="5.47">pre-made and the nature of the</text><text start="231.7" dur="5.19">environmental risks and the massive</text><text start="234.31" dur="5.28">human migrations that are impending and</text><text start="236.89" dur="6.09">and the culture wars and the fact that</text><text start="239.59" dur="6.6">the cultural wars are oriented to a kind</text><text start="242.98" dur="5.61">of war that is beyond just on Facebook I</text><text start="246.19" dur="4.35">think that we have more different issues</text><text start="248.59" dur="6.45">on more fronts that are more</text><text start="250.54" dur="7.02">consequential with the answer not being</text><text start="255.04" dur="4.53">everyone increasing the quality of their</text><text start="257.56" dur="3.57">sense making to find solutions that</text><text start="259.57" dur="2.909">aren&apos;t war because to find solutions</text><text start="261.13" dur="3.68">that aren&apos;t war requires that their</text><text start="262.479" dur="6.421">solutions for everybody</text><text start="264.81" dur="5.919">there is a degenerate movement towards</text><text start="268.9" dur="5.85">more groupthink that becomes more</text><text start="270.729" dur="6.81">polarized and that is a movement towards</text><text start="274.75" dur="5.22">warfare in a time that is one that&apos;s</text><text start="277.539" dur="4.861">never desirable but it&apos;s especially not</text><text start="279.97" dur="3.75">desirable with a world that has as</text><text start="282.4" dur="3.51">centralized and fragile and</text><text start="283.72" dur="3.599">infrastructure as ours where people</text><text start="285.91" dur="3.89">don&apos;t actually grow food and the</text><text start="287.319" dur="4.741">populations of cities depend upon</text><text start="289.8" dur="4.6">infrastructure that if it failed would</text><text start="292.06" dur="3.96">totally suck and where the weapons</text><text start="294.4" dur="5.07">technology we have is unlike anything</text><text start="296.02" dur="5.399">we&apos;ve ever had like we can see that</text><text start="299.47" dur="5.28">these types of patterns have happened in</text><text start="301.419" dur="5.37">the past and led to war and resets and I</text><text start="304.75" dur="7.639">think that that&apos;s too costly to happen</text><text start="306.789" dur="7.62">again and so outside of everyone</text><text start="312.389" dur="4.03">recognizing that and having that</text><text start="314.409" dur="4.38">motivate their willingness to do</text><text start="316.419" dur="5.071">something really uncomfortable which is</text><text start="318.789" dur="4.261">to be willing to disagree with the</text><text start="321.49" dur="3.39">in-group that they&apos;re a part of even</text><text start="323.05" dur="4.919">where the in group will use ostracizing</text><text start="324.88" dur="6.27">and shaming as a way to hold them in</text><text start="327.969" dur="5.431">line and to really engage with other</text><text start="331.15" dur="5.28">people and perspectives and to not do</text><text start="333.4" dur="4.53">the lazy thing of just defecting to the</text><text start="336.43" dur="3.709">sense making that someone else that you</text><text start="337.93" dur="5.76">hold as legitimate Authority gave you</text><text start="340.139" dur="5.56">but really engaging earnestly with all</text><text start="343.69" dur="3.96">of the perspectives that you can to try</text><text start="345.699" dur="3.661">to understand what makes sense to then</text><text start="347.65" dur="4.38">also understand what a way forward that</text><text start="349.36" dur="4.41">doesn&apos;t look like war looks like I don&apos;t</text><text start="352.03" dur="3.359">think there are any good chances for the</text><text start="353.77" dur="3.86">world unless a lot of people start doing</text><text start="355.389"
