start="20.72" dur="5.44">let&apos;s think about an early</text><text start="24.0" dur="3.92">hypothetical idealized market like</text><text start="26.16" dur="3.199">literally people just took their</text><text start="27.92" dur="3.439">shoes and their cows and their sheep and</text><text start="29.359" dur="2.561">their service offerings to a market and</text><text start="31.359" dur="2.161">they</text><text start="31.92" dur="3.6">looked at exchanging them and then</text><text start="33.52" dur="3.92">because trading</text><text start="35.52" dur="4.08">cows for chickens is hard we have some</text><text start="37.44" dur="3.68">kind of currency to mediate a barter</text><text start="39.6" dur="3.76">of goods and services but we&apos;re talking</text><text start="41.12" dur="4.0">about real goods and services</text><text start="43.36" dur="3.44">maybe there&apos;s two people maybe there&apos;s</text><text start="45.12" dur="2.959">five people that sell shoes there&apos;s not</text><text start="46.8" dur="3.12">five thousand of them</text><text start="48.079" dur="3.12">and i can go touch the shoes myself i</text><text start="49.92" dur="2.159">can talk with them i can see what the</text><text start="51.199" dur="4.561">price is</text><text start="52.079" dur="4.48">and there is no hyper normal stimuli of</text><text start="55.76" dur="2.16">advertising</text><text start="56.559" dur="4.0">it&apos;s like somebody yelling from his</text><text start="57.92" dur="4.159">thing so there&apos;s a symmetry between the</text><text start="60.559" dur="5.361">supply and the demand side</text><text start="62.079" dur="5.36">right the supply side is a guy or a few</text><text start="65.92" dur="3.199">guys selling something and the demand</text><text start="67.439" dur="3.281">side is a person or a family trying to</text><text start="69.119" dur="2.641">buy something and they can kind of tell</text><text start="70.72" dur="2.96">each other&apos;s</text><text start="71.76" dur="4.08">to some degree of symmetry buy or beware</text><text start="73.68" dur="4.799">becomes an important idea</text><text start="75.84" dur="4.16">but now when this becomes nike and then</text><text start="78.479" dur="3.521">still one person there&apos;s still a</text><text start="80.0" dur="2.72">symmetry between supply and demand in</text><text start="82.0" dur="4.159">aggregate</text><text start="82.72" dur="6.64">meaning the total amount of money</text><text start="86.159" dur="4.881">flowing into supply equals the total</text><text start="89.36" dur="3.84">amount flowing out of demand but</text><text start="91.04" dur="3.6">this side is coordinated and this site</text><text start="93.2" dur="3.599">isn&apos;t you don&apos;t have something like a</text><text start="94.64" dur="3.92">labor union on all purchasers</text><text start="96.799" dur="3.68">where it&apos;s like all facebook users are</text><text start="98.56" dur="4.0">part of some union that puts money</text><text start="100.479" dur="3.441">together to counter facebook and</text><text start="102.56" dur="3.76">lobbying and regulation you have</text><text start="103.92" dur="4.4">facebook as like a close to a trillion</text><text start="106.32" dur="3.6">dollar organization against me</text><text start="108.32" dur="3.439">as a person and i&apos;m still the same size</text><text start="109.92" dur="2.879">person that i was in those early market</text><text start="111.759" dur="2.881">examples but there wasn&apos;t like a</text><text start="112.799" dur="5.36">trillion dollar organization</text><text start="114.64" dur="5.04">and now when that happens manufactured</text><text start="118.159" dur="4.881">demand</text><text start="119.68" dur="4.079">kills market theory and classical market</text><text start="123.04" dur="3.92">theory</text><text start="123.759" dur="5.84">which is the the idea of why</text><text start="126.96" dur="3.76">a market is like evolution right it&apos;s</text><text start="129.599" dur="4.401">like some</text><text start="130.72" dur="4.08">evolutionary process is that the demand</text><text start="134.0" dur="2.879">is based on</text><text start="134.8" dur="3.439">real people wanting things that will</text><text start="136.879" dur="2.08">actually enhance the quality of their</text><text start="138.239" dur="2.961">life</text><text start="138.959" dur="4.081">and so that creates an evolutionary</text><text start="141.2" dur="3.92">niche for people to provide supply</text><text start="143.04" dur="4.72">and then the rational actor will</text><text start="145.12" dur="4.72">purchase the good or service at the best</text><text start="147.76" dur="4.559">price and of the best value but of</text><text start="149.84" dur="3.759">course as soon as we get to a situation</text><text start="152.319" dur="2.961">where</text><text start="153.599" dur="4.0">and you look at dan ariely and all the</text><text start="155.28" dur="4.0">behavioral economics saying that the rat</text><text start="157.599" dur="3.521">homo economicus the rational actor</text><text start="159.28" dur="3.12">doesn&apos;t exist we end up making choices</text><text start="161.12" dur="4.32">based on</text><text start="162.4" dur="5.36">status that&apos;s conferred with a brand</text><text start="165.44" dur="4.0">based on uh the compellingness of the</text><text start="167.76" dur="2.24">marketing based on all kinds of things</text><text start="169.44" dur="2.0">that are not</text><text start="170.0" dur="3.04">the best product or service at the best</text><text start="171.44" dur="3.76">price</text><text start="173.04" dur="3.919">but you also get that i want stuff that</text><text start="175.2" dur="3.119">will not increase the quality of my life</text><text start="176.959" dur="3.28">i desperately want</text><text start="178.319" dur="4.321">because i was there the demand was</text><text start="180.239" dur="3.92">manufactured into me so it&apos;s not an</text><text start="182.64" dur="3.44">emergent authentic demand that</text><text start="184.159" dur="4.481">represents collective intelligence</text><text start="186.08" dur="4.56">it&apos;s a supply side saying i want to get</text><text start="188.64" dur="4.16">them to want more of my</text><text start="190.64" dur="3.28">and i actually have the power to do that</text><text start="192.8" dur="3.76">using</text><text start="193.92" dur="4.319">applied psychology like actual and as</text><text start="196.56" dur="3.52">soon as you get to split testing</text><text start="198.239" dur="3.121">and the ability to ai split test a</text><text start="200.08" dur="2.879">gazillion things</text><text start="201.36" dur="3.84">we&apos;re talking about radically</text><text start="202.959" dur="3.521">scientifically optimized

dur="5.761">demand</text><text start="209.599" dur="8.161">and then be able to fulfill it and</text><text start="214.72" dur="4.64">and most of that ends up being of the</text><text start="217.76" dur="2.96">type that is actually bad for the</text><text start="219.36" dur="3.12">quality of the life of the people but</text><text start="220.72" dur="3.28">you have the plausible

dur="3.121">control what they&apos;re doing the people</text><text start="227.04" dur="3.279">are choosing it i&apos;m just</text><text start="228.64" dur="3.44">offering the source of supply that</text><text start="230.319" dur="3.28">they&apos;re wanting that&apos;s like</text><text start="232.08" dur="3.04">offering crack to kids and then when</text><text start="233.599" dur="2.961">they come back for more of it like</text><text start="235.12" dur="4.319">saying hey</text><text start="236.56" dur="4.239">so this is that was one of the threads i</text><text start="239.439" dur="5.36">wanted to address</text><text start="240.799" dur="6.8">well i love it um back in uh</text><text start="244.799" dur="3.601">must have been 2013 when game b was</text><text start="247.599" dur="2.56">actually</text><text start="248.4" dur="3.68">a group of people who met in a room and</text><text start="250.159" dur="2.64">talked about things one of the points</text><text start="252.08" dur="4.48">that i</text><text start="252.799" dur="5.921">um was making in that context</text><text start="256.56" dur="3.44">was this inherent asymmetry around</text><text start="258.72" dur="2.639">unionization</text><text start="260.0" dur="3.44">and that the problem is unions have</text><text start="261.359" dur="5.601">gotten a bad wrap</text><text start="263.44" dur="5.28">because of the tight association</text><text start="266.96" dur="4.0">cognitively that we have with labor</text><text start="268.72" dur="4.4">unions right we think of unions and</text><text start="270.96" dur="3.12">labor unions as synonymous but union is</text><text start="273.12" dur="2.88">actually</text><text start="274.08" dur="4.08">a category it&apos;s potentially a very large</text><text start="276.0" dur="4.479">category and effectively</text><text start="278.16" dur="3.28">management always has the benefit of it</text><text start="280.479" dur="4.0">the question is</text><text start="281.44" dur="5.68">will workers have a symmetrical</text><text start="284.479" dur="4.0">entity right that&apos;s the labor case but</text><text start="287.12" dur="4.48">you can make the same case</text><text start="288.479" dur="5.361">with respect to you know banking credit</text><text start="291.6" dur="4.0">unions don&apos;t work they&apos;re very bank-like</text><text start="293.84" dur="3.2">but if they were structured in such a</text><text start="295.6" dur="4.879">way to actually</text><text start="297.04" dur="4.4">you know unionize people who utilize the</text><text start="300.479" dur="3.761">bank</text><text start="301.44" dur="4.8">could be highly effective could be a</text><text start="304.24" dur="3.679">complete replacement for the insurance</text><text start="306.24" dur="3.92">industry which doesn&apos;t even make sense</text><text start="307.919" dur="4.481">in a market context</text><text start="310.16" dur="4.24">but as a risk pool you could do a very</text><text start="312.4" dur="4.639">effective job so anyway yes</text><text start="314.4" dur="3.359">the the question is how do you scale up</text><text start="317.039" dur="4.321">the</text><text start="317.759" dur="5.44">uh collective force and especially how</text><text start="321.36" dur="4.559">do you do it in light of the fact</text><text start="323.199" dur="5.201">that the entities that are already</text><text start="325.919" dur="4.641">effectively unionized</text><text start="328.4" dur="4.48">see it coming and they disrupt it with</text><text start="330.56" dur="5.44">all of their very powerful</text><text start="332.88" dur="7.039">tools and so um</text><text start="336.0" dur="4.639">well anyway go ahead i want to say the</text><text start="339.919" dur="2.961">beginning of an</text><text start="340.639" dur="4.4">answer to that because i think it brings</text><text start="342.88" dur="5.759">us to what you&apos;ve been largely exploring</text><text start="345.039" dur="5.361">in the show of late of the breakdown of</text><text start="348.639" dur="2.56">democracy and open society and what do</text><text start="350.4" dur="3.44">we do about that</text><text start="351.199" dur="3.201">and how that relates to breakdown in</text><text start="353.84" dur="2.079">culture</text><text start="354.4" dur="3.12">and breakdown in market we can look at</text><text start="355.919" dur="2.56">those the relationship between those</text><text start="357.52" dur="3.519">three types of</text><text start="358.479" dur="2.56">entities</text><text start="364.84" dur="4.28">so</text><text start="367.36" dur="3.92">a way of thinking about what the</text><text start="369.12" dur="5.519">architectural</text><text start="371.28" dur="7.52">idea of a liberal democracy is</text><text start="374.639" dur="5.361">and why say the founders of this country</text><text start="378.8" dur="4.88">set it up not as a pure</text><text start="380.0" dur="6.319">laissez-faire market but as a uh</text><text start="383.68" dur="4.72">as a state that had regulatory power and</text><text start="386.319" dur="4.16">the market together</text><text start="388.4" dur="3.2">was the idea is that a market will</text><text start="390.479" dur="3.28">provision</text><text start="391.6" dur="4.4">lots of goods and services better than a</text><text start="393.759" dur="3.521">centralized</text><text start="396.0" dur="3.36">government will so let&apos;s leave the</text><text start="397.28" dur="3.759">market to do the kind of provisioning of</text><text start="399.36" dur="2.399">resource and innovation that it does</text><text start="401.039" dur="2.401">well</text><text start="401.759" dur="4.481">but the market will also do a couple</text><text start="403.44" dur="4.56">really bad things it will lead to</text><text start="406.24" dur="4.079">increasing asymmetries of wealth</text><text start="408.0" dur="3.919">inexorably this is what piketty&apos;s data</text><text start="410.319" dur="2.241">showed and but it&apos;s just obvious having</text><text start="411.919" dur="2.56">more money</text><text start="412.56" dur="3.84">increases your capacity to have access</text><text start="414.479" dur="4.56">to financial services and you know you</text><text start="416.4" dur="4.72">you make interest on debt and on um</text><text start="419.039" dur="4.241">compounding interest on wealth</text><text start="421.12" dur="3.359">and so you end up getting a power law</text><text start="423.28" dur="4.56">distribution of wealth</text><text start="424.479" dur="6.081">so then a few people in just the market</text><text start="427.84" dur="4.4">dynamic would be able to have way</text><text start="430.56" dur="4.16">outsized control over everyone else</text><text start="432.24" dur="4.239">against everyone else&apos;s interests</text><text start="434.72" dur="3.52">and the market creates opportunities for</text><text start="436.479" dur="3.12">things that are really bad we all know</text><text start="438.24" dur="3.2">that like we want there to be a thing</text><text start="439.599" dur="3.361">called crime where you don&apos;t where</text><text start="441.44" dur="3.36">even though there&apos;s a market incentive</text><text start="442.96" dur="2.88">for child sex trafficking and whatever</text><text start="444.8" dur="3.28">else we say</text><text start="445.84" dur="4.0">no we&apos;re we&apos;re going to create some rule</text><text start="448.08" dur="2.72">of law that binds that thing and not</text><text start="449.84" dur="4.56">just have market</text><text start="450.8" dur="6.239">drive it so the idea is</text><text start="454.4" dur="4.96">that we create a state that we actually</text><text start="457.039" dur="4.16">give a monopoly of violence to so it has</text><text start="459.36" dur="3.76">even more power at the bottom of the</text><text start="461.199" dur="4.0">stack of what power is than the top of</text><text start="463.12" dur="4.32">the economic power law distribution</text><text start="465.199" dur="3.761">so the wealthiest people and the</text><text start="467.44" dur="3.199">wealthiest corporations will still be</text><text start="468.96" dur="3.519">bound by this rule of law</text><text start="470.639" dur="3.12">and the rule of law is an encoding of</text><text start="472.479" dur="2.961">the collective</text><text start="473.759" dur="3.201">ethics of the people right the ethics</text><text start="475.44" dur="3.84">are the basis of</text><text start="476.96" dur="4.079">jurisprudence and there is some kind of</text><text start="479.28" dur="3.199">democratic process of getting to say</text><text start="481.039" dur="2.72">what is it that we consider the good</text><text start="482.479" dur="2.72">life and important that we want</text><text start="483.759" dur="3.361">enshrined in rule of law</text><text start="485.199" dur="4.081">we give that a monopoly of violence and</text><text start="487.12" dur="4.4">really then the goal of the state</text><text start="489.28" dur="3.759">is to bind the predatory aspects of</text><text start="491.52" dur="2.88">market incentive while leaving the</text><text start="493.039" dur="2.321">market to do the things that it does</text><text start="494.4" dur="2.639">well</text><text start="495.36" dur="3.6">but pretty much every law is where</text><text start="497.039" dur="3.761">someone has an incentive to do something</text><text start="498.96" dur="3.44">which is a market type dynamic</text><text start="500.8" dur="3.2">that is bad for the whole enough that we</text><text start="502.4" dur="3.359">make a lot to bind it</text><text start="504.0" dur="4.08">okay so the purpose of a state is to</text><text start="505.759" dur="4.321">bind the predatory aspects of a market</text><text start="508.08" dur="3.679">that only works as long as the people</text><text start="510.08" dur="3.519">bind the state</text><text start="511.759" dur="3.84">and the people behind the state if you</text><text start="513.599" dur="4.401">have a government of for and by the</text><text start="515.599" dur="4.961">people of an educated populace who are</text><text start="518.0" dur="4.0">who had a quality of education that were</text><text start="520.56" dur="2.959">capable of understanding</text><text start="522.0"

start="528.32" dur="3.12">they are getting is of adequate quality</text><text start="530.24" dur="2.599">and unbiased enough that they&apos;re</text><text start="531.44" dur="2.8">informed about what&apos;s currently</text><text start="532.839" dur="3.641">happening</text><text start="534.24" dur="3.76">for if you think about that that&apos;s what</text><text start="536.48" dur="2.88">a

dur="4.16">will end up getting captured by the</text><text start="592.0" dur="4.88">market and so you&apos;ll end up having</text><text start="594.64" dur="3.6">the head of the fda be someone who ran a</text><text start="596.88" dur="3.84">big drug or a big</text><text start="598.24" dur="4.08">um ag company and the head of the dod</text><text start="600.72" dur="2.559">being somebody who ran

is</text><text start="615.44" dur="4.639">worse than just an evil market because</text><text start="618.079" dur="3.681">now it has the regulatory apparatus of</text><text start="620.079" dur="2.481">rule of law and monopoly of violence</text><text start="621.76" dur="3.84">backing up</text><text start="622.56" dur="4.959">the market type the dynamics</text><text start="625.6" dur="3.04">so then we say okay well what do we do</text><text start="627.519" dur="3.361">here</text><text start="628.64" dur="4.08">and we see that civilizations fail</text><text start="630.88" dur="3.84">towards either oppression or chaos</text><text start="632.72" dur="3.76">right those are the two fail states they</text><text start="634.72" dur="4.08">fail towards oppression</text><text start="636.48" dur="3.359">if trying to create some coherence</text><text start="638.8" dur="4.24">happens through a top</text><text start="639.839" dur="5.761">down forcing function they fail towards</text><text start="643.04" dur="3.84">chaos if not having enough top-down</text><text start="645.6" dur="2.72">forcing function everybody</text><text start="646.88" dur="3.44">kind of believes whatever they want but</text><text start="648.32" dur="2.959">they have no unifying basis for belief</text><text start="650.32" dur="3.199">and so then</text><text start="651.279" dur="4.0">they will end up going into they&apos;ll</text><text start="653.519" dur="2.241">they&apos;ll balkanize they&apos;ll tribalize and</text><text start="655.279" dur="1.68">then the</text><text start="655.76" dur="3.36">tribal groups will fight against each</text><text start="656.959" dur="5.761">other if you don&apos;t want to</text><text start="659.12" dur="5.68">so and so either</text><text start="662.72" dur="3.04">we keep failing towards chaos which we</text><text start="664.8" dur="2.8">can see is happening</text><text start="665.76" dur="3.04">in the west and in the us in particular</text><text start="667.6" dur="3.679">right now</text><text start="668.8" dur="4.159">and then china which is happy to do the</text><text start="671.279" dur="3.041">oppression thing and oppression beats</text><text start="672.959" dur="3.921">chaos and war</text><text start="674.32" dur="4.4">right because it has more ability to</text><text start="676.88" dur="3.6">execute effectively which is why</text><text start="678.72" dur="3.119">china has built high-speed trains all</text><text start="680.48" dur="3.28">around the world when we haven&apos;t built a</text><text start="681.839" dur="4.321">single one in our country</text><text start="683.76" dur="4.319">um so either we lose to china in the</text><text start="686.16" dur="4.239">21st century an oppression runs the 21st</text><text start="688.079" dur="4.0">century or we beat china at being china</text><text start="690.399" dur="3.761">meaning beating a depression or it&apos;s</text><text start="692.079" dur="3.921">like those are both failure modes</text><text start="694.16" dur="3.2">what is the what is there other than</text><text start="696.0" dur="4.72">oppression or</text><text start="697.36" dur="5.76">um or chaos is</text><text start="700.72" dur="4.239">order that is emergent not imposed which</text><text start="703.12" dur="3.52">requires a culture of people who can all</text><text start="704.959" dur="3.44">make sense of the world on their own and</text><text start="706.64" dur="2.8">communicate effectively to have shared</text><text start="708.399" dur="2.801">sense making</text><text start="709.44" dur="3.44">as a basis for shared choice making the</text><text start="711.2" dur="3.759">idea of an open society</text><text start="712.88" dur="3.519">is that some huge number of people can</text><text start="714.959" dur="2.88">all make choices together</text><text start="716.399" dur="2.88">a huge number of people who see the</text><text start="717.839" dur="3.361">world differently and are anonymous to</text><text start="719.279" dur="5.36">each other not a tribe</text><text start="721.2" dur="7.199">that was an enlightenment era idea right</text><text start="724.639" dur="5.281">born out of the idea that we could all</text><text start="728.399" dur="3.201">make sense of the world together born</text><text start="729.92" dur="3.44">out of the philosophy of science and the</text><text start="731.6" dur="2.72">hegelian dialectic that we could make</text><text start="733.36" dur="3.039">sense of</text><text start="734.32" dur="3.68">base reality and that we could make</text><text start="736.399" dur="4.56">sense of each other&apos;s perspective</text><text start="738.0" dur="4.399">dialectic find a synthesis and then be</text><text start="740.959" dur="2.401">able to have that be the basis of</text><text start="742.399" dur="4.0">governance</text><text start="743.36" dur="4.719">so what what i think is this is not an</text><text start="746.399" dur="2.56">adequate long-term structure because we</text><text start="748.079" dur="3.121">can talk about why</text><text start="748.959" dur="4.0">tech has made nation-state democracies</text><text start="751.2" dur="3.04">obsolete and it&apos;s just not obvious yet</text><text start="752.959" dur="3.281">but it has</text><text start="754.24" dur="3.839">but as an intermediate structure the</text><text start="756.24" dur="4.08">reboot of the thing that</text><text start="758.079" dur="4.081">was intended has to start at the level</text><text start="760.32" dur="3.44">of the people at culture</text><text start="762.16" dur="3.44">and that collective sense making and</text><text start="763.76" dur="3.44">collective good faith dialogue</text><text start="765.6" dur="3.6">because without that you can&apos;t bind</text><text start="767.2" dur="3.92">state without that you can&apos;t find market</text><text start="769.2" dur="4.639">incentive</text><text start="771.12" dur="4.8">okay i love this riff of yours okay i</text><text start="773.839" dur="3.12">think there&apos;s a tremendous amount that&apos;s</text><text start="775.92" dur="3.44">really important</text><text start="776.959" dur="4.641">and the synthesis is super tight i know</text><text start="779.36" dur="4.159">people will have a little bit of trouble</text><text start="781.6" dur="3.52">following it but i i actually would</text><text start="783.519" dur="2.241">advise them to maybe to go back through</text><text start="785.12" dur="2.48">it and</text><text start="785.76" dur="3.68">listen to it again because it&apos;s right on</text><text start="787.6" dur="3.84">the money as far as i&apos;m concerned</text><text start="789.44" dur="3.44">there&apos;s one place where i wonder if it</text><text start="791.44" dur="4.399">doesn&apos;t have two things</text><text start="792.88" dur="5.04">inverted so you talk about the two</text><text start="795.839" dur="4.8">characteristics that are necessary</text><text start="797.92" dur="3.919">in order for uh what did you call it</text><text start="800.639" dur="4.481">liberal democracy</text><text start="801.839" dur="4.24">or whatever it was that you used as a</text><text start="805.12" dur="3.76">moniker</text><text start="806.079" dur="4.961">to function one of them had to do with</text><text start="808.88" dur="2.959">the idea that the state was big enough</text><text start="811.04" dur="3.359">to bind</text><text start="811.839" dur="3.761">the most powerful and well-resourced</text><text start="814.399" dur="3.761">actors</text><text start="815.6" dur="5.76">and the second was that the people have</text><text start="818.16" dur="5.359">to be capable of binding the state</text><text start="821.36" dur="3.599">now i understood you to say that what</text><text start="823.519" dur="3.44">failed first</text><text start="824.959" dur="3.12">was the people&apos;s ability to bind the</text><text start="826.959" dur="3.521">state is that</text><text start="828.079" dur="2.401">correct</text><text start="831.279" dur="3.761">i&apos;m saying that&apos;s at this foundation of</text><text start="833.279" dur="4.961">the stack that we have to address</text><text start="835.04" dur="7.039">the failure with recursive so</text><text start="838.24" dur="6.959">as i see it what happened was</text><text start="842.079" dur="4.721">the power the fact that there is always</text><text start="845.199" dur="3.521">corruption</text><text start="846.8" dur="3.36">um it&apos;s impossible to drive it out</text><text start="848.72" dur="3.359">completely</text><text start="850.16" dur="4.479">the corruption self enlarges the</text><text start="852.079" dur="3.521">loopholes and becomes subtle enough that</text><text start="854.639" dur="4.081">it&apos;s hard to see</text><text start="855.6" dur="6.16">directly the most powerful actors</text><text start="858.72" dur="5.119">suddenly got an infusion of power</text><text start="861.76" dur="4.079">and we could trace down the cause of it</text><text start="863.839" dur="5.201">but let&apos;s just say somewhere in</text><text start="865.839" dur="3.841">recent history the most powerful actors</text><text start="869.04" dur="3.599">became</text><text start="869.68" dur="4.56">more powerful than the state and what</text><text start="872.639" dur="4.64">they did with that power</text><text start="874.24" dur="4.959">was they unhooked the ability of the</text><text start="877.279" dur="4.401">state to regulate the market</text><text start="879.199" dur="3.64">i believe the reason for this was that</text><text start="881.68" dur="4.0">each</text><text start="882.839" dur="5.641">individual</text><text start="885.68" dur="4.159">industry had an interest in having its</text><text start="888.48" dur="3.599">regulations removed</text><text start="889.839" dur="3.201">in order to create a bigger slice of the</text><text start="892.079" dur="3.681">pie for it</text><text start="893.04" dur="4.799">and so effectively what you had was each</text><text start="895.76" dur="3.04">industry agreeing to unregulate every</text><text start="897.839" dur="3.041">other industry</text><text start="898.8" dur="3.76">like you can unregulate if i have a</text><text start="900.88" dur="5.04">pharmaceutical company</text><text start="902.56" dur="4.959">right and you&apos;re an oil company and</text><text start="905.92" dur="3.279">you want to make money but you have to</text><text start="907.519" dur="2.081">be able to up the atmosphere to do</text><text start="909.199" dur="1.921">it</text><text start="909.6" dur="3.919">and i want to make money giving people</text><text start="911.12" dur="5.6">drugs that they shouldn&apos;t have</text><text start="913.519" dur="4.88">and you know corrupting the the fda</text><text start="916.72" dur="3.76">then we&apos;ll partner and so you what you</text><text start="918.399" dur="4.721">got was many industries partnering to</text><text start="920.48" dur="5.359">unhook the ability of the state to bind</text><text start="923.12" dur="4.24">the market but one of the things that</text><text start="925.839" dur="2.161">they had to do in order to make that</text><text start="927.36" dur="2.64">work</text><text start="928.0" dur="3.759">was they had to eliminate the ability of</text><text start="930.0" dur="3.279">the people to veto</text><text start="931.759" dur="3.76">right and so this is where we get this</text><text start="933.279" dur="4.161">incredibly toxic duopoly</text><text start="935.519" dur="3.201">that pretends to do our bidding and</text><text start="937.44" dur="4.16">pretends to be</text><text start="938.72" dur="4.08">um you know fiercely opposed the two</text><text start="941.6" dur="3.44">sides of it but in fact</text><text start="942.8" dur="4.08">the thing they&apos;re united about is not</text><text start="945.04" dur="2.64">allowing something else to compete with</text><text start="946.88" dur="3.36">them</text><text start="947.68" dur="4.0">for power so it&apos;s you know the wolf in</text><text start="950.24" dur="3.519">sheep&apos;s clothing</text><text start="951.68" dur="3.12">is in charge of the thing that is</text><text start="953.759" dur="4.08">supposed to be</text><text start="954.8" dur="4.88">protecting us from wolves um</text><text start="957.839" dur="3.761">in any case we don&apos;t have to go too deep</text><text start="959.68" dur="3.36">there but this this is actually super</text><text start="961.6" dur="4.32">important</text><text start="963.04" dur="4.479">go for it this is related to the thing</text><text start="965.92" dur="5.599">we said about</text><text start="967.519" dur="6.56">as the market as a whole gets bigger</text><text start="971.519" dur="4.721">then the individual consumer stays an</text><text start="974.079" dur="4.081">individual consumer but the supply side</text><text start="976.24" dur="5.039">the company gets much larger</text><text start="978.16" dur="4.72">as that happens the asymmetry of the war</text><text start="981.279" dur="1.92">between them of the game theory between</text><text start="982.88" dur="3.759">them</text><text start="983.199" dur="5.2">gets larger and so uh manufactured</text><text start="986.639" dur="3.44">demand becomes a more intense thing well</text><text start="988.399" dur="5.44">the same thing is true</text><text start="990.079" dur="5.361">in terms of the market capacity to</text><text start="993.839" dur="3.92">influence the government and the market</text><text start="995.44" dur="4.639">government complex&apos;s capacity to</text><text start="997.759"

dur="3.279">there&apos;s a heap of mechanisms that happen</text><text start="1006.399" dur="3.44">and there&apos;s not like five guys at the</text><text start="1007.759" dur="2.561">top who are
