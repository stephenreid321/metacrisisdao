and</text><text start="41.12" dur="5.04">that maybe shouldn&apos;t be right so</text><text start="43.6" dur="4.08">facebook ran experiments of doping what</text><text start="46.16" dur="3.68">goes in people&apos;s news feed and they</text><text start="47.68" dur="3.359">could put more negative valence things</text><text start="49.84" dur="2.8">and the people would start becoming</text><text

dur="2.879">because</text><text start="60.879" dur="3.441">we evolved to take in the world around</text><text start="62.879" dur="3.441">us and the world around us couldn&apos;t be</text><text

start="84.08" dur="3.6">what happens is i get a false sense of</text><text start="86.08" dur="2.96">the world right</text><text start="87.68" dur="3.52">so</text><text start="89.04" dur="3.68">i can think that who becomes president</text><text start="91.2" dur="2.879">is the most important thing for</text><text start="92.72" dur="3.6">me to figure out even though i have</text><text start="94.079" dur="3.441">almost no agency and it will probably i</text><text start="96.32" dur="2.96">can&apos;t even predict what the</text><text start="97.52" dur="4.48">difference it&apos;ll make in my life</text><text start="99.28" dur="4.08">and it can it can become more consuming</text><text start="102.0" dur="3.04">than how my kids are doing in school</text><text start="103.36" dur="2.96">which i have real agency on and is more</text><text start="105.04" dur="2.719">consequential in the course of their</text><text start="106.32" dur="3.2">whole life and how i feel about who i</text><text

dur="4.64">most you know like do i get the vaccine</text><text start="120.479" dur="4.801">or not i have some choice in this right</text><text start="123.28" dur="3.519">and so because i have some choice</text><text start="125.28" dur="2.88">it seems like it makes sense to like pay</text><text start="126.799" dur="2.561">attention to it enough to make a good</text><text start="128.16" dur="3.2">choice</text><text start="129.36" dur="3.28">most of the big issues</text><text start="131.36" dur="3.12">like</text><text start="132.64" dur="4.8">what is the real urgency of

don&apos;t really have much choice</text><text start="141.84" dur="3.92">in one way or the other and it&apos;s almost</text><text start="144.4" dur="3.6">just like</text><text start="145.76" dur="3.76">like studying it is almost the</text><text start="148.0" dur="3.12">fascination porn that makes you want to</text><text start="149.52" dur="2.719">look at an accident when you drive by</text><text start="151.12" dur="2.479">slowly</text><text start="152.239" dur="2.881">right it&apos;s like</text><text start="153.599" dur="3.681">there&apos;s something very compelling about</text><text start="155.12" dur="4.8">it for no good reason of anything</text><text start="157.28" dur="4.8">you can do about it now</text><text start="159.92" dur="4.16">you know i talk about sense making i pay</text><text start="162.08" dur="3.36">attention to these things and i happen</text><text start="164.08" dur="3.2">to have actually</text><text start="165.44" dur="3.6">put my life in a position where i&apos;m</text><text start="167.28" dur="4.88">trying to do something about that but</text><text start="169.04" dur="4.32">that i still can&apos;t about all the issues</text><text start="172.16" dur="2.96">and</text><text start="173.36" dur="3.519">um</text><text start="175.12" dur="3.119">and honestly if i was working as a</text><text start="176.879" dur="4.64">doctor</text><text start="178.239" dur="3.28">or i was working as a</text><text start="181.76" dur="5.119">as a school teacher or</text><text start="184.48" dur="3.759">any number of other things</text><text start="186.879" dur="3.36">i would want to make sure more of my</text><text start="188.239" dur="3.681">sense making was connected to how well i</text><text start="190.239" dur="5.841">could serve the people in the world it</text><text start="191.92" dur="4.16">was in front of me and my agency there</text><text start="196.4" dur="3.839">so</text><text start="197.68" dur="4.8">i would say you need to step back from</text><text start="200.239" dur="3.92">the input feed</text><text start="202.48" dur="3.039">to be able to reflect more internally</text><text start="204.159" dur="3.041">and say what are the things i actually</text><text start="205.519" dur="3.36">have agency over that i care about the</text><text start="207.2" dur="4.0">most</text><text start="208.879" dur="4.321">and then how do i make sure that my</text><text start="211.2" dur="3.679">the preponderance of my attention</text><text start="213.2" dur="4.24">matches the things i care about the most</text><text start="214.879" dur="4.961">that i can do something about</text><text start="217.44" dur="2.4">and</text><text start="220.08" dur="3.12">then to the degree that you see that</text><text start="221.599" dur="2.881">other people seem to have some agency</text><text start="223.2" dur="2.399">and you believe their sense making it a</text><text start="224.48" dur="2.479">domain you care about you&apos;re like how</text><text start="225.599" dur="3.121">can i support them</text><text start="226.959" dur="3.761">maybe i donate to that particular thing</text><text start="228.72" dur="4.64">maybe i share their information and</text><text start="230.72" dur="3.92">boost it maybe i whatever it is right</text><text start="233.36" dur="2.64">um</text><text start="234.64" dur="3.2">that&apos;s also a really valuable thing</text><text start="236.0" dur="3.76">where you&apos;re like i&apos;m going to proxy</text><text start="237.84" dur="4.0">support to something i can&apos;t do that</text><text start="239.76" dur="4.24">much of my own but i care about</text><text start="241.84" dur="3.759">um and that actually takes a lot less</text><text start="244.0" dur="3.92">energy than stressing on it and still</text><text start="245.599" dur="4.081">not knowing what the to do</text><text start="247.92" dur="3.76">um</text><text start="249.68" dur="5.119">when it comes to something like a choice</text><text start="251.68" dur="6.0">you&apos;re going to make so say the vaccines</text><text start="254.799" dur="4.56">you can&apos;t know that if you spend 100</text><text start="257.68" dur="3.04">hours researching it you&apos;ll come up with</text><text start="259.359" dur="2.321">a better answer than just going with</text><text start="260.72" dur="1.84">your gut</text><text start="261.68" dur="3.76">like</text><text start="262.56" dur="4.72">the the nature of the fallibility of the</text><text start="265.44" dur="3.68">data and the fact that there there</text><text start="267.28" dur="3.44">haven&apos;t been the long term studies that</text><text start="269.12" dur="3.44">we would want to see and whatever like</text><text start="270.72" dur="2.88">you can&apos;t be sure that that 100 hours</text><text start="272.56" dur="2.96">will actually make you make a better</text><text start="273.6" dur="3.44">decision right</text><text start="275.52" dur="3.119">and</text><text start="277.04" dur="3.76">uh</text><text start="278.639" dur="2.161">so</text><text start="281.04" dur="4.719">either you make the decision that feels</text><text start="283.44" dur="4.24">best for you and put it out of your mind</text><text start="285.759" dur="3.44">and whatever</text><text start="287.68" dur="3.44">solution you make see if there&apos;s some</text><text start="289.199" dur="3.041">mitigating things you can do right so i</text><text start="291.12" dur="3.28">know a bunch of people who decide to get</text><text start="292.24" dur="3.679">the vaccine they find naturopaths who</text><text start="294.4" dur="2.96">say well here are things that will</text><text start="295.919" dur="2.961">probably help your body metabolize it</text><text start="297.36" dur="3.2">better and make it less</text><text start="298.88" dur="2.879">likely to be harmful do we have any idea</text><text start="300.56" dur="2.639">less likely to be harmful no because</text><text start="301.759" dur="3.681">nobody&apos;s studied getting the</text><text start="303.199" dur="4.56">vitamin c iv associated with it over 30</text><text start="305.44" dur="3.92">years like it&apos;s just a guess but it&apos;s</text><text start="307.759" dur="3.28">reasonable guesses from smart people who</text><text start="309.36" dur="3.52">have paid attention to it</text><text start="311.039" dur="3.841">or you don&apos;t get it and you say okay i&apos;m</text><text start="312.88" dur="3.759">going to do the zinc and vitamin d and</text><text start="314.88" dur="3.84">quercetin and ivermectin and green tea</text><text start="316.639" dur="6.0">and that kind of to to mitigate the</text><text start="318.72" dur="3.919">positive getting it or whatever</text><text start="322.84" dur="4.919">so make the decision that seems the best</text><text start="325.6" dur="4.8">with what you can see how you can kind</text><text start="327.759" dur="2.641">of mitigate</text><text start="330.88" dur="4.0">and recognize that a lot more investment</text><text start="333.44" dur="3.12">wouldn&apos;t necessarily give you a higher</text><text start="334.88" dur="4.24">confidence margin</text><text start="336.56" dur="4.8">that&apos;s also a part of it</text><text start="339.12" dur="4.56">okay</text><text start="341.36" dur="4.24">but one thing i&apos;ll say is that like</text><text start="343.68" dur="3.519">you know there&apos;s this biblical quote to</text><text start="345.6" dur="2.8">those who have more shall be given to</text><text start="347.199" dur="2.881">those who don&apos;t have the little they</text><text start="348.4" dur="3.76">have will be taken away</text><text start="350.08" dur="3.2">it&apos;s kind of like the idea of the secret</text><text start="352.16" dur="2.64">but it&apos;s this</text><text start="353.28" dur="4.56">you know i think everybody knows what</text><text start="354.8" dur="3.04">it&apos;s like when</text><text start="357.919" dur="3.041">when someone feels really abundant in</text><text start="359.44" dur="2.72">their relationships and friendships the</text><text start="360.96" dur="2.48">way that they show up in the world is</text><text start="362.16" dur="2.8">more attractive to other people when</text><text start="363.44" dur="2.72">somebody feels like</text><text start="364.96" dur="2.239">really bummed that they don&apos;t have a</text><text start="366.16" dur="2.4">relationship and they don&apos;t have</text><text start="367.199" dur="2.881">friendships and they&apos;re kind of down on</text><text start="368.56" dur="3.759">the world and whatever like they&apos;re kind</text><text start="370.08" dur="3.679">of maximally not attractive and so to</text><text start="372.319" dur="2.72">those who don&apos;t have more is taken away</text><text start="373.759" dur="3.601">to those who have more is given there&apos;s</text><text start="375.039" dur="4.72">just a there is a autopoetic nature of</text><text start="377.36" dur="4.959">the state we&apos;re in right</text><text start="379.759" dur="4.641">so if i feel a sense of that the areas</text><text start="382.319" dur="3.921">i&apos;m paying attention to i&apos;m actually</text><text start="384.4" dur="4.48">learning real things and i&apos;m increasing</text><text start="386.24" dur="4.16">my agency that will actually orient me</text><text start="388.88" dur="3.36">to continue to increase my agency and</text><text start="390.4" dur="4.48">over time i might be able to have more</text><text start="392.24" dur="4.88">capacity to take on more things</text><text start="394.88" dur="3.759">if i am in a state of kind of uh</text><text start="397.12" dur="3.519">overwhelming hopelessness i will</text><text start="398.639" dur="3.921">probably continue to advance</text><text start="400.639" dur="3.361">overwhelming hopelessness because if i</text><text start="402.56" dur="2.56">feel overwhelmed i&apos;m likely to look at</text><text start="404.0" dur="2.319">something i don&apos;t know what to make of</text><text start="405.12" dur="2.4">this and then look at another thing look</text><text start="406.319" dur="2.561">at another thing and not actually go</text><text start="407.52" dur="4.239">deep enough to figure any thing</text><text start="408.88" dur="2.879">out and just propagate</text><text start="412.0" dur="4.639">so the question of how can i center in</text><text start="414.16" dur="4.479">my actual sense of agency and grow it</text><text start="416.639" dur="4.96">and you grow it by acting on it and</text><text start="418.639" dur="5.28">empowering it is a part of the long term</text><text start="421.599" dur="4.32">consideration next up we&apos;ve got sarah</text><text start="423.919" dur="4.4">ness he&apos;s been applying authentic</text><text start="425.919" dur="4.881">relating and conversational skills to</text><text start="428.319" dur="3.201">hot cultural topics conversation really</text><text start="430.8" dur="3.04">is</text><text start="431.52" dur="4.799">in many ways i think a game like we talk</text><text start="433.84" dur="4.56">about game a and game b i think game b</text><text start="436.319" dur="2.88">is really understanding</text><text start="438.4" dur="3.28">um</text><text start="439.199" dur="4.161">that conversation can be</text><text start="441.68" dur="3.44">uh</text><text start="443.36" dur="3.2">that there there are skills you can</text><text start="445.12" dur="2.56">learn in it there are ways that we can</text><text start="446.56" dur="3.199">talk better with each

dur="3.84">understanding into conversation it&apos;s not</text><text start="453.84" dur="3.359">just a well this is the way i did it</text><text start="455.68" dur="3.6">when i&apos;m a kid and when i was a kid and</text><text start="457.199" dur="3.921">now i do that for the rest of my life</text><text start="459.28" dur="3.6">so i&apos;ve been doing a several workshops</text><text start="461.12" dur="4.4">with rebel wisdom now both around</text><text start="462.88" dur="4.08">connection and they&apos;ve been kind enough</text><text start="465.52" dur="3.28">to give me the space to develop some</text><text start="466.96" dur="3.76">ideas and games around how this can be</text><text start="468.8" dur="3.76">used in what i think is one of the</text><text start="470.72" dur="3.36">biggest questions of our time which is</text><text start="472.56" dur="5.039">how do we communicate through</text><text start="474.08" dur="5.119">polarization and across divides</text><text start="477.599" dur="4.961">um so that&apos;s a little bit of what we&apos;re</text><text start="479.199" dur="4.641">going to be playing with today</text><text start="482.56" dur="3.6">and what i&apos;m going to what i&apos;m going to</text><text start="483.84" dur="4.479">do is i&apos;m going to share a model that</text><text start="486.16" dur="3.84">i&apos;ve been using lately to describe some</text><text start="488.319" dur="2.88">of why we why we seem to get into</text><text start="490.0" dur="3.199">conflict and have a hard time</text><text start="491.199" dur="3.28">communicating past it let&apos;s go into this</text><text start="493.199" dur="3.921">model that i&apos;ve been playing with this</text><text start="494.479" dur="4.4">content context concern</text><text start="497.12" dur="3.68">uh</text><text start="498.879" dur="4.401">no model will ever encompass the</text><text start="500.8" dur="4.16">complexity of being human but</text><text start="503.28" dur="3.84">um i think sometimes having frames can</text><text start="504.96" dur="4.56">be helpful for us so</text><text start="507.12" dur="4.079">um i think that in any given situation</text><text start="509.52" dur="2.8">we have content which is the level we&apos;re</text><text start="511.199" dur="3.361">speaking at</text><text start="512.32" dur="4.24">we have contexts which are which are our</text><text

way this is subjective too</text><text start="520.88" dur="4.399">the classic example i give is like</text><text start="523.279" dur="4.0">we go out for coffee i think we&apos;re</text><text start="525.279" dur="4.0">hanging out you think it&apos;s a date we</text><text start="527.279" dur="3.361">have very different kind of reactions to</text><text start="529.279" dur="2.801">what&apos;s

dur="2.8">um or</text><text start="534.56" dur="2.8">in the vaccination example that i keep</text><text start="536.24" dur="2.56">giving</text><text start="537.36" dur="3.36">i think that we&apos;re

dur="3.6">perspectives and for you you think that</text><text start="544.72" dur="3.84">i&apos;m trying to convince you as to why you</text><text start="546.64" dur="3.28">should get vaccinated we&apos;re going to</text><text start="548.56" dur="3.279">have really different reactions to the</text><text start="549.92" dur="5.039">conversations right so this this is</text><text start="551.839" dur="4.481">beliefs this is um kind of the top level</text><text start="554.959" dur="3.041">like frame through which we&apos;re going to</text><text start="556.32" dur="3.12">see the world so one of the things that</text><text start="558.0" dur="2.959">can happen in conversation is just</text><text start="559.44" dur="3.28">asking about like</text><text start="560.959" dur="3.921">okay like where are you coming from with</text><text start="562.72" dur="4.0">this what are your beliefs what do you</text><text start="564.88" dur="3.76">think is true why do you think we&apos;re</text><text start="566.72" dur="3.679">having this conversation right now</text><text start="568.64" dur="3.199">here&apos;s why i think we are here&apos;s what i</text><text start="570.399" dur="2.321">want to get out of it</text><text start="571.839" dur="2.241">um</text><text start="572.72" dur="4.0">so naming some of these things and that</text><text start="574.08" dur="4.64">can even include facts like this is the</text><text start="576.72" dur="3.52">data that i have that has me believe the</text><text start="578.72" dur="3.28">things that i believe</text><text start="580.24" dur="4.48">um so that&apos;s context and even though</text><text start="582.0" dur="4.48">it&apos;s supposedly reality i have a context</text><text start="584.72" dur="4.08">you have a context and revealing that</text><text start="586.48" dur="4.24">can be a big part of uh getting to</text><text start="588.8" dur="3.76">clarity with each other</text><text start="590.72" dur="3.28">and then another piece is concern and</text><text start="592.56" dur="4.16">this is where a lot of things like</text><text start="594.0" dur="4.16">non-violent communication and um</text><text start="596.72" dur="3.76">authentic relating and circling will</text><text start="598.16" dur="5.44">often focus a lot on this which is like</text><text start="600.48" dur="5.28">why like what matters to you here</text><text start="603.6" dur="4.32">um what are your values what are the</text><text start="605.76" dur="4.16">stories that have you believe this so</text><text start="607.92" dur="4.08">this is kind of almost the more heart</text><text start="609.92" dur="3.919">centered like what do you feel about</text><text start="612.0" dur="3.36">this why why are we even having this</text><text start="613.839" dur="3.0">conversation</text><text start="615.36" dur="4.0">from a personal</text><text start="616.839" dur="3.321">level uh</text><text start="619.36" dur="2.56">and</text><text start="620.16" dur="3.28">a way that you could reflect this even</text><text start="621.92" dur="3.68">is like what i think i get about you</text><text start="623.44" dur="3.839">here what i think i understand about</text><text start="625.6" dur="3.04">your values your</text><text start="627.279" dur="3.041">you know what&apos;s here for you you&apos;ll</text><text start="628.64" dur="3.439">notice my voice even drops a little bit</text><text start="630.32" dur="2.88">when i&apos;m talking about it it&apos;s like more</text><text start="632.079" dur="2.801">of a</text><text start="633.2" dur="3.28">relational level</text><text start="634.88" dur="5.04">and so we can even see this playing out</text><text start="636.48" dur="5.76">to some extent in society right now</text><text start="639.92" dur="3.84">um so what you can do in conversation</text><text start="642.24" dur="3.2">and the reason i&apos;m sharing this is if</text><text start="643.76" dur="4.0">you notice that talking is happening at</text><text start="645.44" dur="4.079">the level of content if we&apos;re just going</text><text start="647.76" dur="3.36">back and forth and we&apos;re kind of</text><text start="649.519" dur="3.521">asserting our views but not getting</text><text start="651.12" dur="3.76">anywhere you can either go to context</text><text start="653.04" dur="4.32">like okay like where are your views</text><text start="654.88" dur="4.56">coming from what are your beliefs here</text><text start="657.36" dur="3.039">what do you think is true</text><text start="659.44" dur="2.72">um</text><text start="660.399" dur="3.761">you know what what demographics or</text><text start="662.16" dur="5.359">groups do you belong to that think that</text><text start="664.16" dur="4.88">this is important um even like uh to</text><text start="667.519" dur="3.281">some extent like what social groups are</text><text start="669.04" dur="3.039">you part of and the concern of like what</text><text start="670.8" dur="2.8">might happen</text><text start="672.079" dur="2.401">if you didn&apos;t</text><text start="673.6" dur="2.4">uh</text><text start="674.48" dur="2.799">if you if you changed your view like</text><text start="676.0" dur="2.72">what are you concerned about because</text><text start="677.279" dur="2.881">some people will get kicked out of their</text><text start="678.72" dur="2.72">social groups if they change their view</text><text start="680.16" dur="2.96">like so there&apos;s real concerns here</text><text start="681.44" dur="3.2">there&apos;s real things at stake so the</text><text start="683.12" dur="3.92">other thing you can go to are like what</text><text start="684.64" dur="4.319">are your motivations um what do you care</text><text start="687.04" dur="3.6">about why are we even having this</text><text start="688.959" dur="4.32">conversation for you</text><text start="690.64" dur="4.08">um what&apos;s a story about a reason this</text><text start="693.279" dur="2.8">matters to you</text><text start="694.72" dur="2.64">and depending on the person you may have</text><text start="696.079" dur="3.2">to go to either of these or you can</text><text start="697.36" dur="4.159">reveal them yourself</text><text start="699.279" dur="4.8">um like okay here&apos;s what i think we&apos;re</text><text start="701.519" dur="4.961">having a conversation about um here&apos;s</text><text start="704.079" dur="4.0">what matters to me in the conversation</text><text start="706.48" dur="3.359">here&apos;s why i&apos;m even talking about it</text><text start="708.079" dur="3.921">here are my motivations for those views</text><text start="709.839" dur="3.521">in the first place</text><text start="712.0" dur="2.88">and it really just depends on where the</text><text start="713.36" dur="2.96">conversation is going i&apos;ll usually</text><text start="714.88" dur="2.639">bounce back and forth between these</text><text start="716.32" dur="2.72">depending on</text><text start="717.519" dur="3.521">what the other person&apos;s receptivity</text><text start="719.04" dur="3.919">seems to be</text><text start="721.04" dur="3.599">and</text><text start="722.959" dur="3.601">just like trying out different different</text><text start="724.639" dur="4.161">options in conversation and the one and</text><text start="726.56" dur="3.2">only john viveki teaches our section on</text><text start="728.8" dur="2.32">wisdom</text><text start="729.76" dur="3.84">he talks a lot about the need to</text><text start="731.12" dur="4.32">cultivate what he calls dear logos</text><text start="733.6" dur="3.2">conversational practices that take us</text><text start="735.44" dur="3.68">somewhere new</text><text start="736.8" dur="4.0">and i&apos;ve never seen him so energized as</text><text start="739.12" dur="4.0">he was at our recent state of</text><text start="740.8" dur="4.719">sense-making event on how we steal the</text><text start="743.12" dur="4.32">culture and you&apos;ve had this when you&apos;ve</text><text start="745.519" dur="3.201">had those really great conversations in</text><text start="747.44" dur="3.92">your life</text><text start="748.72" dur="4.72">it took on a life of its own it went in</text><text start="751.36" dur="4.32">a direction you could not have foreseen</text><text start="753.44" dur="3.92">and it reached into parts of your psyche</text><text start="755.68" dur="3.839">you didn&apos;t realize or hadn&apos;t been</text><text start="757.36" dur="4.64">touched what&apos;s what&apos;s so powerful in</text><text start="759.519" dur="4.32">these practices is people often say i</text><text start="762.0" dur="3.839">didn&apos;t know that kind of intimacy was</text><text start="763.839" dur="3.921">possible and they say paradoxical things</text><text start="765.839" dur="5.12">like it was so new but it felt like</text><text start="767.76" dur="5.44">that&apos;s always who i really was they do</text><text start="770.959" dur="5.12">this simultaneous it&apos;s always been that</text><text start="773.2" dur="5.759">way and it&apos;s really radically new</text><text start="776.079" dur="5.2">because what they&apos;re doing right is</text><text start="778.959" dur="4.32">they&apos;re on they&apos;re they&apos;re participating</text><text start="781.279" dur="3.36">in something that</text><text start="783.279" dur="3.36">is not them</text><text start="784.639" dur="4.481">not just the other person not just some</text><text start="786.639" dur="4.721">some but something that has a life of</text><text start="789.12" dur="4.64">its own dynamically between them that&apos;s</text><text start="791.36" dur="3.52">the logos and what you&apos;re we&apos;re doing in</text><text start="793.76" dur="4.4">these</text><text start="794.88" dur="5.28">practices is we&apos;re making</text><text start="798.16" dur="3.44">the we&apos;re making ourselves available</text><text start="800.16" dur="3.2">notice how the language is almost sounds</text><text start="801.6" dur="4.08">religious we&apos;re making ourselves</text><text start="803.36" dur="4.64">available to the logos heraclitus said</text><text start="805.68" dur="4.399">it way back when you know 500 and</text><text start="808.0" dur="5.2">something bce don&apos;t listen to my words</text><text start="810.079" dur="5.841">but listen to the logos within them</text><text start="813.2" dur="4.96">that&apos;s what we&apos;re trying to do</text><text start="815.92" dur="4.8">learn to listen not just to the words</text><text start="818.16" dur="4.239">but to the logos within them because if</text><text start="820.72" dur="3.52">we can</text><text start="822.399" dur="4.0">we can take</text><text start="824.24" dur="4.56">that the collective intelligence of</text><text start="826.399" dur="4.961">distributed cognition and we could</text><text start="828.8" dur="4.88">participate it in its weaving itself</text><text start="831.36" dur="5.12">into collective wisdom and that&apos;s the</text><text start="833.68" dur="4.48">best thing we have</text><text start="836.48" dur="4.0">for trying to deal with the hyper</text><text start="838.16" dur="3.52">objects that we are trying to confront</text><text start="840.48" dur="2.96">right now</text><text start="841.68" dur="4.64">and i know you&apos;ve talked about stealing</text><text start="843.44" dur="5.6">the culture which i think is</text><text start="846.32" dur="5.12">for me it&apos;s exactly that how do we</text><text start="849.04" dur="5.359">how do we mainstream these practices how</text><text start="851.44" dur="4.72">we how do we bring a counter-cultural</text><text start="854.399" dur="5.601">movement around this sort of deeper</text><text start="856.16" dur="5.919">sense of connection and communication</text><text start="860.0" dur="3.6">thank you for asking that question david</text><text start="862.079" dur="2.481">how do we steal the culture as basically</text><text start="863.6" dur="2.32">though</text><text start="864.56" dur="2.88">we&apos;ve got five minutes john how do we</text><text start="865.92" dur="3.76">steal the culture yeah i&apos;ll do it right</text><text start="867.44" dur="4.32">now okay um so i&apos;m going to say</text><text start="869.68" dur="3.36">something a little bit provocative but</text><text start="871.76" dur="3.519">because we need to be provocative at</text><text start="873.04" dur="4.08">this point i think that what you pointed</text><text start="875.279" dur="3.201">to that gra that gravity i think we</text><text start="877.12" dur="3.279">should use the word that people most</text><text start="878.48" dur="3.84">spontaneously use in that situation and</text><text start="880.399" dur="3.761">it&apos;s old word and we have to give up</text><text start="882.32" dur="4.0">some of its old baggage but but we&apos;re</text><text start="884.16" dur="3.76">we&apos;re not we&apos;re we&apos;re not just making it</text><text start="886.32" dur="3.12">a symbol we&apos;re renewing it we&apos;re</text><text start="887.92" dur="4.56">revitalizing it and that&apos;s the word</text><text start="889.44" dur="4.48">spirit this is a spiritual exercise and</text><text start="892.48" dur="4.0">these are spiritual practices because</text><text start="893.92" dur="6.24">they really put you in touch with the</text><text start="896.48" dur="6.719">flowing present transformative dynamic</text><text start="900.16" dur="5.679">of collective wisdom and that to me is a</text><text start="903.199" dur="4.32">very good meaning for spirit and i think</text><text start="905.839" dur="3.761">it&apos;s what people</text><text start="907.519" dur="4.081">really did mean but we&apos;ve lost that and</text><text start="909.6" dur="4.32">we&apos;ve reduced it into some weird</text><text start="911.6" dur="4.88">cartoonish image of a ghostly entity</text><text start="913.92" dur="4.479">within us or something like that and i i</text><text start="916.48" dur="4.0">i&apos;m sorry i don&apos;t mean to be too</text><text start="918.399" dur="3.921">aggressive to some people&apos;s belief but i</text><text start="920.48" dur="3.76">don&apos;t know if that old</text><text start="922.32" dur="5.6">picture is doing much work for us it</text><text start="924.24" dur="5.92">doesn&apos;t seem to be where this new model</text><text start="927.92" dur="4.4">but perhaps of what was always being</text><text start="930.16" dur="4.64">said i&apos;m willing to acknowledge that</text><text start="932.32" dur="5.92">that&apos;s spirit then here&apos;s the proposal</text><text start="934.8" dur="6.32">that ultimately what changes a</text><text start="938.24" dur="5.76">civilization is to change the spirit of</text><text start="941.12" dur="4.719">its culture um this is a in some sense a</text><text start="944.0" dur="3.199">hegelian idea although i reject kegel&apos;s</text><text start="945.839" dur="4.401">reduction of everything to the</text><text start="947.199" dur="4.401">propositional right and so</text><text start="950.24" dur="4.0">think about</text><text start="951.6" dur="4.239">see i i sometimes people get some some</text><text start="954.24" dur="3.76">people get angry with me you should be</text><text start="955.839" dur="4.481">more political john and i say no</text><text start="958.0" dur="4.88">because politics is degenerated to</text><text start="960.32" dur="4.319">ideology and ideology is saying all that</text><text start="962.88" dur="4.079">matters is the propositional and i&apos;m</text><text start="964.639" dur="4.961">deeply philosophically opposed to that</text><text start="966.959" dur="4.161">also i don&apos;t want to model this on the</text><text start="969.6" dur="3.44">french or the russian revolution i want</text><text start="971.12" dur="4.48">to model what we&apos;re trying to do on the</text><text start="973.04" dur="5.28">axial revolution or what christianity</text><text start="975.6" dur="5.039">did towards the collapse of antiquity</text><text start="978.32" dur="4.319">christianity didn&apos;t overthrow

didn&apos;t codify new laws until had it</text><text start="987.519" dur="3.76">had done something else it created these</text><text start="989.36" dur="4.0">little biological communities

were weaving</text><text start="1000.639" dur="4.721">those together and they created a new</text><text start="1002.56" dur="4.16">spirit and and you know</text><text start="1005.36" dur="3.36">and</text><text start="1006.72" dur="4.16">think about things that we now take for</text><text start="1008.72" dur="5.039">granted that christianity bestowed upon</text><text
