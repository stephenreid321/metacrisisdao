pattern replicator which</text><text start="15.719" dur="5.881">means that it can mutate and change and</text><text start="18.17" dur="7.18">affect behavior and propagate much much</text><text start="21.6" dur="6.36">much faster right and we can kind of say</text><text start="25.35" dur="4.769">that in homo sapiens are genetic</text><text start="27.96" dur="5.9">selected for mimetics for higher-order</text><text start="30.119" dur="7.71">mimetics right our genetics because most</text><text start="33.86" dur="5.56">other species what the selective</text><text start="37.829" dur="4.41">pressures had them be adaptive to an</text><text start="39.42" dur="5.43">environment right they there&apos;s mutation</text><text start="42.239" dur="3.931">and then the mutations that survive and</text><text start="44.85" dur="3.75">make the best are the ones that make it</text><text start="46.17" dur="4.65">through but that&apos;s within the context of</text><text start="48.6" dur="4.02">survive in that environment and are able</text><text start="50.82" dur="2.94">to mate successfully in that environment</text><text start="52.62" dur="3.15">so they become more more fit to their</text><text start="53.76" dur="3.93">environment so the cheetah does really</text><text start="55.77" dur="3.059">well in the savanna I would not do well</text><text start="57.69" dur="3.33">in the Arctic and the polar bear</text><text start="58.829" dur="3.601">wouldn&apos;t do wellness event and Orca</text><text start="61.02" dur="3.539">wouldn&apos;t do well outside of the

dur="4.57">abstraction capacity which is both our</text><text start="69.119" dur="6.831">capacity for language and memes as well</text><text start="71.46" dur="7.019">as tools we were able to go and become</text><text start="75.95" dur="3.34">adaptive become actually apex predators</text><text start="78.479" dur="2.941">in the savanna</text><text start="79.29" dur="3.869">and in the Arctic and in the ocean and</text><text start="81.42" dur="3.269">everywhere right we were able to go to</text><text start="83.159" dur="4.171">every environment which means that as</text><text start="84.689" dur="4.381">soon as our population would normally if</text><text start="87.33" dur="3.719">we were any other animals start to level</text><text start="89.07" dur="3.18">off in relationship with the</text><text start="91.049" dur="3.121">environmental carrying capacity of an</text><text start="92.25" dur="3.479">environment we just moved we were able</text><text start="94.17" dur="3.75">to decimate that environment to move to</text><text start="95.729" dur="5.07">the next one right into all of them and</text><text start="97.92" dur="4.68">then but that part isn&apos;t the part I want</text><text start="100.799" dur="3.75">to get into it now it&apos;s it&apos;s since we</text><text start="102.6" dur="3.96">were gonna be adaptive to totally new</text><text start="104.549" dur="5.131">environments and since we were gonna</text><text start="106.56" dur="7.11">create tools where what it was to be</text><text start="109.68" dur="6.45">adaptive was changing sin since we</text><text start="113.67" dur="4.229">modify our environment in ways the other</text><text start="116.13" dur="3.69">animals don&apos;t we can&apos;t come in</text><text start="117.899" dur="3.661">genetically fit to a specific</text><text start="119.82" dur="3.24">environment we have to come in and be</text><text start="121.56" dur="2.94">able to imprint the environment that</text><text start="123.06" dur="3.559">we&apos;re in so we know how to be fit two</text><text start="124.5" dur="5.729">totally different environments cuz like</text><text start="126.619" dur="5.921">it&apos;s not that adaptive for us to throw</text><text start="130.229" dur="3.551">Spears or even climb trees all that well</text><text start="132.54" dur="2.89">but it is to be able to</text><text start="133.78" dur="3.66">like text and drive and stuff that</text><text start="135.43" dur="5.24">wouldn&apos;t have been adaptive thousand</text><text start="137.44" dur="7.08">years ago at all and so this is why</text><text start="140.67" dur="5.8">human babies are embryonic or jnanis for</text><text start="144.52" dur="4.439">so long right compared to any other</text><text start="146.47" dur="3.87">animal and if you like the thing I like</text><text start="148.959" dur="2.911">to do here is to think about a horse</text><text start="150.34" dur="4.53">standing up in like 20 minutes</text><text start="151.87" dur="5.61">and a human being able to walk in like a</text><text start="154.87" dur="4.5">year and just think about how many 20</text><text start="157.48" dur="5.07">minute segments multiplied into a year</text><text start="159.37" dur="5.55">to get a sense of how much longer we are</text><text start="162.55" dur="4.05">helpless than anything else is and even</text><text start="164.92" dur="4.89">amongst the other primates close to us</text><text start="166.6" dur="4.62">is there&apos;s really nothing like us in</text><text start="169.81" dur="4.41">terms of the extended helplessness and</text><text start="171.22" dur="4.98">that&apos;s because we&apos;re we don&apos;t have</text><text start="174.22" dur="3.239">inherited knowledge of how to be us</text><text start="176.2" dur="2.43">since the environment is going to be</text><text start="177.459" dur="2.791">different we have to imprint the</text><text start="178.63" dur="3.03">environment that we&apos;re in to be able to</text><text start="180.25" dur="9.769">be adaptive to environments that we&apos;re</text><text start="181.66" dur="12.27">changing right so and so this is a</text><text start="190.019" dur="5.921">saying that our genetics selected for</text><text start="193.93" dur="3.779">neuroplasticity selected for memetics</text><text start="195.94" dur="4.609">our hardware selected for faster</text><text start="197.709" dur="5.971">software updates that could have faster</text><text start="200.549" dur="4.931">changes in adaptive basis so that we</text><text start="203.68" dur="6.869">could move our environments and all</text><text start="205.48" dur="7.259">those types of things so if we think</text><text start="210.549" dur="4.291">about a meat and kind of like a gene as</text><text start="212.739" dur="3.78">an ax pattern replicator but as an</text><text start="214.84" dur="4.59">abstract pattern replicator that can</text><text start="216.519" dur="4.171">mutate much quicker there&apos;s also a big</text><text start="219.43" dur="5.55">differences that the other animals</text><text start="220.69" dur="7.26">aren&apos;t it in an environment the mutation</text><text start="224.98" dur="7.53">across genes is very evenly distributed</text><text start="227.95" dur="7.2">mutations happening to the gazelles and</text><text start="232.51" dur="4.71">to the Cheetahs at an equal rate right</text><text start="235.15" dur="3.66">and there&apos;s co selective pressures on</text><text start="237.22" dur="3.299">both of them so they&apos;re both getting</text><text start="238.81" dur="3.6">faster the slowest ones of each are</text><text start="240.519" dur="4.261">dying off and so there&apos;s this kind of</text><text start="242.41" dur="3.93">symmetry of power that has the</text><text start="244.78" dur="4.47">competitive pressures between them have</text><text start="246.34" dur="5.97">them all up level but when we start</text><text start="249.25" dur="4.799">being mostly mimetic and the other</text><text start="252.31" dur="3.299">species are still mostly genetic meaning</text><text start="254.049" dur="3.271">we&apos;re largely based we&apos;re getting</text><text start="255.609" dur="3.06">adaptive based on abstract pattern</text><text start="257.32" dur="2.969">replicators are still in stan see a</text><text start="258.669" dur="3.391">pattern replicators we can increase our</text><text start="260.289" dur="3.661">per date of capacity much faster than</text><text start="262.06" dur="3.72">they can increase their than the</text><text start="263.95" dur="2.85">environment can increase its resilience</text><text start="265.78" dur="3.569">to operative capacity</text><text start="266.8" dur="4.95">which means that we can debase the whole</text><text start="269.349" dur="4.201">substrate that we depend upon which is</text><text start="271.75" dur="4.8">self terminating right you can&apos;t keep</text><text start="273.55" dur="5.91">debasing that which you depend upon so</text><text start="276.55" dur="5.579">in evolution there is a selection</text><text start="279.46" dur="7.739">process for the genes that make it</text><text start="282.129" dur="6.931">through right but they there is this</text><text start="287.199" dur="3.421">kind of symmetry of the genes that make</text><text start="289.06" dur="4.199">it through because of the evenness of</text><text start="290.62" dur="6.09">mutation and because of the co selective</text><text start="293.259" dur="6.241">pressures now with mimetics the memes</text><text start="296.71" dur="5.01">that make it through are the memes that</text><text start="299.5" dur="4.08">win in a rival risk context not the ones</text><text start="301.72" dur="3.06">that necessarily represent the true or</text><text start="303.58" dur="3.869">the good or the beautiful so the</text><text start="304.78" dur="4.979">propagate of memes propagate more than</text><text start="307.449" dur="5.15">the true memes propagate this is a super</text><text start="309.759" dur="6.331">important concept to understand which is</text><text start="312.599" dur="6.431">like I was always dumbfounded thinking</text><text start="316.09" dur="4.35">about the evolution of religions take</text><text start="319.03" dur="6.27">Christianity for instance and they say</text><text start="320.44" dur="7.17">ok so Jesus when they brought Mary</text><text start="325.3" dur="3.839">Magdalene said let he who has no</text><text start="327.61" dur="3.33">sentence amongst you cast the first</text><text start="329.139" dur="2.971">stone right and then when they&apos;re</text><text start="330.94" dur="2.879">nailing him up he says Father forgive</text><text start="332.11" dur="4.559">them for they know not what they they do</text><text start="333.819" dur="5.85">and he&apos;s like bringing forgiveness to</text><text start="336.669" dur="5.461">Judaism and in his name we did the</text><text start="339.669" dur="4.711">Crusades in the Inquisition and said we</text><text start="342.13" dur="5.189">will not just kill but torture anyone</text><text start="344.38" dur="5.279">who doesn&apos;t accept the Lord of peace is</text><text start="347.319" dur="4.111">there it&apos;s like how the did we do</text><text start="349.659" dur="5.91">that how did we do the mental gymnastics</text><text start="351.43" dur="5.669">to take the guy whose key teachings were</text><text start="355.569" dur="3.15">forgiveness and torture people in the</text><text start="357.099" dur="3.72">name of that well we figured out how to</text><text start="358.719" dur="5.281">do it right but the key is that we was</text><text start="360.819" dur="5.761">super adaptive so you you&apos;ve got an idea</text><text start="364.0" dur="5.46">right say you&apos;ve got Jesus teachings or</text><text start="366.58" dur="4.32">we can take it in any of them and then</text><text start="369.46" dur="3.78">there&apos;s going to be a bunch of mutations</text><text start="370.9" dur="8.489">on that idea different interpretations</text><text start="373.24" dur="9.09">of it some of the mutations say be quiet</text><text start="379.389" dur="6.661">and don&apos;t push your ideas on anyone like</text><text start="382.33" dur="5.88">be contemplative and you know etc and</text><text start="386.05" dur="3.899">those ones don&apos;t catch on because they</text><text start="388.21" dur="4.53">aren&apos;t being intentionally propagated</text><text start="389.949" dur="4.89">and other ones say go out and propagate</text><text start="392.74" dur="5.039">these ideas on missions and on Crusades</text><text start="394.839" dur="4.311">and focus on the not the forgiveness</text><text start="397.779" dur="3.561">parts but on the</text><text start="399.15" dur="5.28">rath and Leviticus and who God&apos;s enemies</text><text start="401.34" dur="4.8">we&apos;re like focus on those parts and that</text><text start="404.43" dur="6.36">you actually get better spots in heaven</text><text start="406.14" dur="7.38">for converting more people right and and</text><text start="410.79" dur="4.47">so what you end up getting is that the</text><text start="413.52" dur="4.8">ideas that catch on are the ones that</text><text start="415.26" dur="5.7">win and narrative warfare but they&apos;re</text><text start="418.32" dur="3.93">having to catch on so then say Islam is</text><text start="420.96" dur="3.81">also competing for some of the same</text><text start="422.25" dur="5.19">people right because ultimately the</text><text start="424.77" dur="4.53">religions become the basis of of in</text><text start="427.44" dur="4.68">groups that are competing against out</text><text start="429.3" dur="5.91">groups for fundamentally political and</text><text start="432.12" dur="5.36">economic and survival type basis so I</text><text start="435.21" dur="4.35">can hold people together with a</text><text start="437.48" dur="4.57">political left or political right</text><text start="439.56" dur="4.62">ideology or a capitalist communist</text><text start="442.05" dur="3.99">ideology or racial identity ideology or</text><text start="444.18" dur="5.07">religious ideologies all of those become</text><text start="446.04" dur="5.58">the basis of an in-group that can be</text><text start="449.25" dur="4.41">that can bind together to be more</text><text start="451.62" dur="4.29">successful in competition with assumed</text><text start="453.66" dur="3.45">out groups right but what that means is</text><text start="455.91" dur="3.78">that rival risk game theoretic</text><text start="457.11" dur="4.65">environment is going to be selecting for</text><text start="459.69" dur="5.91">what is effective at rivalry not what is</text><text start="461.76" dur="5.55">true and and definitely not what is good</text><text start="465.6" dur="3.3">for the whole and the moment that</text><text start="467.31" dur="3.66">anybody figures something out that is</text><text start="468.9" dur="4.02">more effective at rivalry than everybody</text><text start="470.97" dur="4.05">else reverse engineers at and you know</text><text start="472.92" dur="6.6">creates similar mimetic mutations on</text><text start="475.02" dur="7.71">other sides and so there&apos;s not that many</text><text start="479.52" dur="6.66">James right there they&apos;re lovely people</text><text start="482.73" dur="5.01">right and totally nonviolent and aren&apos;t</text><text start="486.18" dur="3.03">you know aren&apos;t gonna hurt anybody but</text><text start="487.74" dur="2.73">they&apos;re also not pushing their ideas on</text><text start="489.21" dur="3.42">anybody so the ideas aren&apos;t spreading</text><text start="490.47" dur="4.23">that fast so the ideas that have an</text><text start="492.63" dur="5.58">artificial focus on the spreading of</text><text start="494.7" dur="4.92">ideas and figure out how to emotionally</text><text start="498.21" dur="3.96">manipulate people into believing the</text><text start="499.62" dur="9.63">idea with heaven and hell and whatever</text><text start="502.17" dur="9.54">right are going to spread more so this</text><text start="509.25" dur="4.8">is a key thing to get is you know</text><text start="511.71" dur="3.96">whether we&apos;re taking it it&apos;s not just</text><text start="514.05" dur="3.0">right I&apos;m giving the example of the</text><text start="515.67" dur="3.45">teachings of Jesus turning into the</text><text start="517.05" dur="6.06">Crusades or the Inquisition but it&apos;s</text><text start="519.12" dur="6.24">also take thinking like Darwin right so</text><text start="523.11" dur="5.61">take the context in which Darwin came</text><text start="525.36" dur="7.32">about Darwin came about just following</text><text start="528.72" dur="5.52">Malthus right so so we</text><text start="532.68" dur="4.62">got the British Empire&apos;s first kind of</text><text start="534.24" dur="5.099">real world ruling empire first time that</text><text start="537.3" dur="3.0">a global inventory of resources was ever</text><text start="539.339" dur="2.791">conducted</text><text start="540.3" dur="3.57">Malthus came up with the fundamental</text><text start="542.13" dur="3.48">principle of scarcity or inadequacy that</text><text start="543.87" dur="3.3">says hey people are reproducing</text><text start="545.61" dur="2.789">geometrically resources reproduce</text><text start="547.17" dur="2.58">arithmetic li there&apos;s not gonna be</text><text start="548.399" dur="2.791">enough for everybody not everybody&apos;s</text><text start="549.75" dur="4.32">gonna make it well then who&apos;s gonna make</text><text start="551.19" dur="4.35">it that idea says compassion is not</text><text start="554.07" dur="3.51">viable we can&apos;t all make it</text><text start="555.54" dur="3.57">fundamentally mathematically there</text><text start="557.58" dur="5.58">aren&apos;t the resources for now this is</text><text start="559.11" dur="6.53">gibberish actually today because we know</text><text start="563.16" dur="3.989">that populations don&apos;t reproduce</text><text start="565.64" dur="3.61">exponentially forever</text><text start="567.149" dur="4.471">they steady-state and we&apos;ve already seen</text><text start="569.25" dur="5.16">the population in Japan and in Denmark</text><text start="571.62" dur="4.26">and another like the most economically</text><text start="574.41" dur="4.65">successful countries start decreasing</text><text start="575.88" dur="5.61">right and we also know that we can</text><text start="579.06" dur="3.899">recycle resources we don&apos;t have to just</text><text start="581.49" dur="3.12">have a linear materials economy where we</text><text start="582.959" dur="3.811">use them up and turn them into trash and</text><text start="584.61" dur="3.57">that completely fundamentally changes</text><text start="586.77" dur="2.97">the underlying scarcity basis we can</text><text start="588.18" dur="4.349">also share resources in different ways</text><text start="589.74" dur="4.92">so the underlying thinking behind</text><text start="592.529" dur="3.541">Malthus isn&apos;t true but he didn&apos;t know</text><text start="594.66" dur="3.95">that at the time it seemed quite</text><text start="596.07" dur="4.68">compelling so let me say ok so</text><text start="598.61" dur="5.41">solution for everyone a world works for</text><text start="600.75" dur="8.6">all is not even viable those who want it</text><text start="604.02" dur="7.53">are simply not facing up to reality and</text><text start="609.35" dur="3.73">so if not everyone&apos;s gonna make it who&apos;s</text><text start="611.55" dur="4.47">going to and so then Darwin comes out in</text><text start="613.08" dur="4.74">that context and so the idea of survival</text><text start="616.02" dur="3.21">of the fittest is the idea we focus on</text><text start="617.82" dur="3.69">the most even though that&apos;s not an idea</text><text start="619.23" dur="5.4">that he emphasized early in the writing</text><text start="621.51" dur="5.579">hardly at all right and so there was</text><text start="624.63" dur="7.16">again taking Darwin&apos;s idea in one</text><text start="627.089" dur="6.75">context and then also taking the most</text><text start="631.79" dur="5.91">propagated version of it that led to</text><text start="633.839" dur="7.281">social Darwinism the basically reified</text><text start="637.7" dur="3.42">institutional sociopathy</text></transcript>
