what I&apos;m</text><text start="294.19" dur="3.75">really digging for is something about</text><text start="296.229" dur="3.211">you that maybe people haven&apos;t heard</text><text start="297.94" dur="3.12">before you know something that shows a</text><text start="299.44" dur="3.42">little bit about your personality from</text><text start="301.06" dur="3.509">your youth I know actually there was a</text><text start="302.86" dur="4.2">space you came from in Iowa you were</text><text start="304.569" dur="4.35">homeschooled and it was from the works</text><text start="307.06" dur="3.479">of Buckminster Fuller and David Bohm</text><text start="308.919" dur="2.821">that you had learned from but how did</text><text start="310.539" dur="3.03">that shape you you know you&apos;re this</text><text start="311.74" dur="4.41">young kid you&apos;re in an environment in</text><text start="313.569" dur="4.141">Iowa there&apos;s meditation going on how did</text><text start="316.15" dur="3.419">you pull from that and what did that</text><text start="317.71" dur="4.889">mean to what you do now well I would say</text><text start="319.569" dur="5.431">one of the big unique fortunate things</text><text start="322.599" dur="6.121">about bringing for me was I was mostly</text><text start="325.0" dur="5.31">homeschooled and I happened to be in one</text><text start="328.72" dur="2.789">meditation community but was in a number</text><text start="330.31" dur="3.949">of different alternative communities</text><text start="331.509" dur="6.241">that focused on personal development</text><text start="334.259" dur="5.351">activism different forms and fields of</text><text start="337.75" dur="4.199">science permaculture right my parents</text><text start="339.61" dur="4.38">were interested in evolutionary topics</text><text start="341.949" dur="3.75">and so we got to live in proximity to</text><text start="343.99" dur="3.39">different cool thinkers and evolutionary</text><text start="345.699" dur="3.631">topics but the benefit of the</text><text start="347.38" dur="4.14">homeschooling was my parents were</text><text start="349.33" dur="4.019">wanting to do an experiment the</text><text start="351.52" dur="4.29">educational experiment which was before</text><text start="353.349" dur="4.111">unschooling was the thing the idea was</text><text start="355.81" dur="4.38">let&apos;s give them no fixed curriculum at</text><text start="357.46" dur="3.929">all and expose them to as many things as</text><text start="360.19" dur="3.06">possible see what their interests are</text><text start="361.389" dur="4.861">and facilitate that and so this was my</text><text start="363.25" dur="5.219">education growing up so I never had a</text><text start="366.25" dur="5.82">fixed amount of spelling or handwriting</text><text start="368.469" dur="5.79">or you know social studies or so my</text><text start="372.07" dur="4.56">spelling still depends on spell checker</text><text start="374.259" dur="3.63">completely my handwriting depends upon</text><text start="376.63" dur="2.7">the fact that only used computers</text><text start="377.889" dur="3.301">because I you know I never developed</text><text start="379.33" dur="4.679">those things but I did get to dive into</text><text start="381.19" dur="4.259">the sciences very deeply very early in a</text><text start="384.009" dur="3.331">way that was untraditional that is a way</text><text start="385.449" dur="3.991">that would would be the case for any kid</text><text start="387.34" dur="4.949">if they were facilitated to follow what</text><text start="389.44" dur="5.099">they were really interested in and so my</text><text start="392.289" dur="4.261">early upbringing was all of the sciences</text><text start="394.539" dur="4.44">all of the different philosophic</text><text start="396.55" dur="3.78">traditions and all areas of activism but</text><text start="398.979" dur="3.84">one of the other really neat things was</text><text start="400.33" dur="5.73">because I didn&apos;t learn them in the</text><text start="402.819" dur="5.371">contexts of subjects right this is</text><text start="406.06" dur="4.05">social science this is biology this is</text><text start="408.19" dur="3.96">physics I didn&apos;t even think of them in</text><text start="410.11" dur="4.64">isolated way so I&apos;d be cross applying</text><text start="412.15" dur="5.37">principles from thermodynamics to</text><text start="414.75" dur="4.599">astrophysics to cell biology to looking</text><text start="417.52" dur="3.869">at what is true about how reality works</text><text start="419.349" dur="3.721">across all of these because I didn&apos;t</text><text start="421.389" dur="2.7">think of them in segmented ways and I</text><text start="423.07" dur="2.67">didn&apos;t think of them in terms of</text><text start="424.089" dur="3.3">discrete laws of a domain</text><text start="425.74" dur="3.66">what age were you when you started to be</text><text start="427.389" dur="3.361">fascinated about systems and about how</text><text start="429.4" dur="2.699">things work I mean because is there a</text><text start="430.75" dur="3.63">time we remember like I know when I was</text><text start="432.099" dur="3.66">a kid I took a part of telephone and my</text><text start="434.38" dur="3.689">curiosity I have this insatiable</text><text start="435.759" dur="4.141">curiosity and I always wondered how</text><text start="438.069" dur="3.061">things work so I wasn&apos;t satisfied unless</text><text start="439.9" dur="3.09">I took it apart and put it back together</text><text start="441.13" dur="3.719">did you feel like that in your life I</text><text start="442.99" dur="4.23">mean how has that serves you I do how</text><text start="444.849" dur="3.811">would you describe your curiosity the</text><text start="447.22" dur="3.84">same as yours I&apos;m the same as any other</text><text start="448.66" dur="5.789">kids I maybe just had more facilitation</text><text start="451.06" dur="4.8">so it happens with kids usually is they</text><text start="454.449" dur="3.0">want to take apart the telephone they</text><text start="455.86" dur="3.0">want to make lasers they want to you</text><text start="457.449" dur="4.201">know do all kinds of interesting things</text><text start="458.86" dur="4.92">boys and particularly those ones but all</text><text start="461.65" dur="4.53">genders whatever they&apos;re interested in</text><text start="463.78" dur="4.289">is gonna be very deep but but also</text><text start="466.18" dur="4.049">things that are more esoteric like I&apos;ve</text><text start="468.069" dur="3.961">never met a little kid who at 2 3 4</text><text start="470.229" dur="4.111">years old doesn&apos;t ask questions like why</text><text start="472.03" dur="3.78">is the sky blue and we give them</text><text start="474.34" dur="4.71">nonsense answers but to actually</text><text start="475.81" dur="4.5">understand how the atmosphere works and</text><text start="479.05" dur="2.73">how diffraction works and how light</text><text start="480.31" dur="2.609">works and how that intersects with the</text><text start="481.78" dur="2.729">way the rods and the cones and our eye</text><text start="482.919" dur="4.441">work and what the subjective experience</text><text start="484.509" dur="5.34">of blue compared to the actual objective</text><text start="487.36" dur="3.63">experience of light scattering it&apos;s</text><text start="489.849" dur="2.671">actually one of the deepest most</text><text start="490.99" dur="3.54">profound things to answer that well that</text><text start="492.52" dur="5.429">exposes them to everything from the hard</text><text start="494.53" dur="4.5">problem of neuroscience to atmosphere</text><text start="497.949" dur="3.03">sciences and where they&apos;re gonna learn</text><text start="499.03" dur="3.9">about climate change and stellar</text><text start="500.979" dur="3.66">formation and physics they ask why is</text><text start="502.93" dur="4.829">fire hot it&apos;s the same kind of thing</text><text start="504.639" dur="4.921">right like well we can talk about what</text><text start="507.759" dur="3.09">the photon releasing is and how photons</text><text start="509.56" dur="3.06">are exchanging energy in the hand but</text><text start="510.849" dur="3.93">then why are my subjectively</text><text start="512.62" dur="5.039">experiencing it as hot and so what</text><text start="514.779" dur="5.13">happens is we just don&apos;t know so we</text><text start="517.659" dur="3.87">don&apos;t answer their questions well and we</text><text start="519.909" dur="3.18">instead steer them to things that we do</text><text start="521.529" dur="3.151">know that are really not interesting</text><text start="523.089" dur="2.851">like how to spell something or what the</text><text start="524.68" dur="2.61">capital is something that is and we turn</text><text start="525.94" dur="3.089">them off to schooling we turn them off</text><text start="527.29" dur="4.26">to learning turn them off to their</text><text start="529.029" dur="5.221">innate fascination of existing so when</text><text start="531.55" dur="4.349">we look at the whole issue of the kind</text><text start="534.25" dur="3.149">of welfare model dynamic where we think</text><text start="535.899" dur="2.971">if people are not capitalistic aliy</text><text start="537.399" dur="5.461">motivated they&apos;ll just watch TV all the</text><text start="538.87" dur="5.25">time kids are so intrinsically motivated</text><text start="542.86" dur="2.969">to learn everything they can and to</text><text start="544.12" dur="3.209">build stuff and to create and to like</text><text start="545.829" dur="3.57">want to go to work with mom or dad and</text><text start="547.329" dur="4.26">figure out how to do stuff what happens</text><text start="549.399"

dur="4.98">beginning of his talks was that he was</text><text start="670.04" dur="4.93">he became aware early in childhood that</text><text start="673.26" dur="4.08">he had slightly below

dur="4.41">school got spelling faster than him got</text><text start="681.18" dur="5.06">math faster than him but some things</text><text start="683.37" dur="5.52">happen some specific experiences where</text><text start="686.24" dur="4.03">he became interested in figuring out</text><text start="688.89" dur="2.489">what could a person of normal</text><text start="690.27"

dur="4.89">who he would say he was utterly</text><text start="705.749" dur="4.05">convinced he had no endogenous no</text><text start="707.999" dur="3.57">capacities that were beyond normal but a</text><text start="709.799" dur="3.24">development process one of the things</text><text start="711.569" dur="3.27">that&apos;s so interesting for me then was</text><text start="713.039" dur="4.38">all the people who developed themselves</text><text start="714.839" dur="3.99">to the kind of highest degrees of</text><text start="717.419" dur="4.77">comprehensive development said things</text><text start="718.829" dur="7.74">very similar and so it&apos;s clear to me</text><text start="722.189" dur="7.02">that and you know then we&apos;ve no very</text><text start="726.569" dur="4.5">deeply into all of the evolutionary</text><text start="729.209" dur="6.12">biology of the topics and educational</text><text start="731.069" dur="5.76">theory that the highest stages of

dur="3.6">beyond normal can be the new baseline</text><text start="740.699" dur="3.271">what was the stage where you went</text><text start="742.259" dur="3.57">through where you realized a that you</text><text start="743.97" dur="3.029">had something that was neurodegenerative</text><text start="745.829" dur="3.0">I think a lot of people deal with</text><text start="746.999"

you</text><text start="752.579" dur="3.93">realized eh I have something that I&apos;m</text><text start="754.529" dur="3.3">not exactly sure how to fix and then</text><text start="756.509" dur="6.75">what did that road look like for you to</text><text start="757.829" dur="8.78">heal so I was in undergraduate I was 18</text><text start="763.259" dur="5.82">I was rock climbing weightlifting</text><text start="766.609" dur="6.07">healthy and then had symptoms start</text><text start="769.079" dur="5.79">kicking on very rapidly that were kind</text><text start="772.679" dur="4.44">of neuromuscular joint type things did</text><text start="774.869" dur="4.11">not have a background in by our health</text><text start="777.119" dur="5.731">at that point was studying math and</text><text start="778.979" dur="5.46">physics and other topics and so you</text><text start="782.85" dur="3.419">started studying seeing all of the</text><text start="784.439" dur="3.15">doctors and Integrative doctors and</text><text start="786.269" dur="2.82">various kind of modalities they could</text><text start="787.589" dur="3.45">and ended up figuring out a handful of</text><text start="789.089" dur="4.47">underlying phenomena from inflammatory</text><text start="791.039" dur="4.95">conditions and the underlying causes in</text><text start="793.559" dur="4.17">terms of toxicity and pathogenicity and</text><text start="795.989" dur="3.63">things were more causing it for myself</text><text start="797.729" dur="3.241">and end up reversing it fairly quickly</text><text start="799.619" dur="3.93">what was the time period where it</text><text start="800.97" dur="6.359">reversed three months Wow three months</text><text start="803.549" dur="5.91">and the initial diagnosis was rheumatic</text><text start="807.329" dur="3.42">autoimmune disorder it doesn&apos;t have a</text><text start="809.459" dur="3.03">cure</text><text start="810.749" dur="3.84">doesn&apos;t traditionally have a cure so</text><text start="812.489" dur="5.19">that was very neat and then I was you</text><text start="814.589" dur="5.041">know free of symptom pathology for for</text><text start="817.679" dur="6.691">many years until</text><text start="819.63" dur="7.02">mmm 30 something and again very rapidly</text><text start="824.37" dur="3.27">had an onset of something and it was</text><text start="826.65" dur="2.91">probably the same underlying</text><text start="827.64" dur="3.51">susceptibilities they hadn&apos;t been fully</text><text start="829.56" dur="3.75">addressed previously they got read</text><text start="831.15" dur="4.17">triggered by some new phenomena and then</text><text start="833.31" dur="4.02">it was a much more aggressive onset with</text><text start="835.32" dur="4.11">more complexity involved and that</text><text start="837.33" dur="5.76">required me doing a much deeper dive</text><text start="839.43" dur="6.03">into modeling it know that this was</text><text start="843.09" dur="6.06">important so we look at something like</text><text start="845.46" dur="5.07">MS or rheumatoid arthritis or ALS or any</text><text start="849.15" dur="3.51">any kind of complex disease or</text><text start="850.53" dur="3.6">psychiatric issues ER but say we&apos;re</text><text start="852.66" dur="4.35">looking at so we&apos;re looking at a</text><text start="854.13" dur="5.76">rheumatic condition we will see</text><text start="857.01" dur="4.68">correlation between that romantic</text><text start="859.89" dur="3.72">conditions statistically significant</text><text start="861.69" dur="3.6">correlation and things like a particular</text><text start="863.61" dur="3.06">kind of toxin exposure whether it&apos;s a</text><text start="865.29" dur="2.91">heavy metal or whether it&apos;s an</text><text start="866.67" dur="3.69">organophosphate or something like that</text><text start="868.2" dur="3.63">we don&apos;t see one for one it&apos;s not</text><text start="870.36" dur="2.85">everyone who has it has had that</text><text start="871.83" dur="3.36">exposure or everybody&apos;s had that</text><text start="873.21" dur="3.54">exposure has that disease but we see</text><text start="875.19" dur="3.24">statistically meaningful correlation</text><text start="876.75" dur="2.94">will see statistically meaningful</text><text start="878.43" dur="4.34">correlation with a bunch of different</text><text start="879.69" dur="6.27">forms of U of subclinical infections of</text><text

up being very</text><text start="891.42" dur="4.74">hard the traditional medical model is</text><text start="892.89" dur="6.57">looking for one disease primarily having</text><text start="896.16" dur="4.8">one pathway that is primarily causing it</text><text start="899.46" dur="5.64">and then it&apos;s going to have one chemical</text><text start="900.96" dur="6.0">that addresses that pathway but for our</text><text start="905.1" dur="4.92">current medical approach is good for</text><text start="906.96" dur="5.25">acute cause issues so this is why it&apos;s</text><text start="910.02" dur="3.72">so great for emergency medicine because</text><text start="912.21" dur="3.72">the cause is actually pretty acute it&apos;s</text><text start="913.74" dur="4.2">pretty clear and you can address it but</text><text start="915.93" dur="3.69">where you have chronic diseases that</text><text start="917.94" dur="3.27">developed over some period of time and</text><text start="919.62" dur="2.76">often times were multifactorial they</text><text start="921.21" dur="3.09">don&apos;t have one causes they have multiple</text><text start="922.38" dur="3.6">different causes it&apos;s not even the same</text><text start="924.3" dur="4.59">multiple set for different people and</text><text start="925.98" dur="4.2">there was delayed causation in terms of</text><text start="928.89" dur="2.36">when the first thing happened and you</text><text start="930.18" dur="3.3">have some underlying pathophysiology</text><text start="931.25" dur="4.21">happening before symptomology occurs</text><text start="933.48" dur="4.59">it&apos;s actually really tricky to figure</text><text start="935.46" dur="4.5">out how that works and you don&apos;t treat a</text><text start="938.07" dur="3.5">cluster of symptoms called a disease you</text><text start="939.96" dur="3.93">actually have to see what is going on</text><text start="941.57" dur="4.9">specific pathway wise for that person</text><text start="943.89" dur="4.14">can be able to address that which is the</text><text start="946.47" dur="3.15">future of personalized medicine you feel</text><text start="948.03" dur="3.03">like you were really supporting all the</text><text start="949.62" dur="3.24">systems underneath so that they&apos;re all</text><text start="951.06" dur="2.49">happening in synergy what did you do</text><text start="952.86" dur="2.22">specifically</text><text start="953.55" dur="2.64">and then how did the different</text><text start="955.08" dur="2.43">nootropics and the other other</text><text start="956.19" dur="2.73">supplementation&apos;s that you were taking I</text><text start="957.51" dur="2.91">mean how did that work for you the</text><text start="958.92" dur="3.96">reason that I got into nootropics</text><text start="960.42" dur="3.63">obviously as someone who&apos;s interested in</text><text start="962.88" dur="2.4">learning I was interested

dur="5.31">having like a lot of neuromuscular</text><text start="1002.39" dur="3.66">symptoms II there was cognitive symptoms</text><text start="1004.13" dur="3.6">all G was that massive brain fog you&apos;re</text><text start="1006.05" dur="4.11">going through what was it yeah so</text><text start="1007.73" dur="3.96">decreased cognitive capability how many</text><text start="1010.16"

the</text><text start="1016.46" dur="3.36">things I was interested in that was much</text><text start="1018.41" dur="2.82">more debilitating than physical debility</text><text start="1019.82" dur="3.42">because at that time you&apos;re doing</text><text start="1021.23" dur="3.81">high-level thinking so you had to be</text><text start="1023.24" dur="3.54">cognitively capable it wasn&apos;t

dur="3.9">dive in cognitive chemistry and that</text><text start="1058.31" dur="4.56">looked like everything in the nootropic</text><text start="1059.75" dur="6.54">space the brain nutrient space the

dur="5.61">looking at that you know let&apos;s say I</text><text start="1103.029" dur="5.4">looked at a few hundred pathways and the</text><text start="1106.389" dur="4.861">interactions but I&apos;ve

dur="3.66">never in my life haven&apos;t been able to be</text><text start="1473.01" dur="3.6">so focused and the same way that I&apos;m</text><text start="1474.69" dur="3.96">feeling you right now

first thing that we looked at</text><text start="1494.25" dur="5.85">was you know as we were saying we see</text><text start="1497.46" dur="5.13">this exponential rise in products that</text><text

the</text><text start="1889.68" dur="4.65">dendrite and everything what&apos;s happening</text><text start="1891.18" dur="5.94">there different things so say you just</text><text start="1894.33" dur="4.98">look at acetylcholine right that one</text><text start="1897.12" dur="3.87">neurotransmitter for a moment you can</text><text start="1899.31" dur="4.98">use something like Cooper&apos;s na which is</text><text start="1900.99" dur="5.22">a very common nootropic which is what we</text><text start="1904.29" dur="3.87">call an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor</text><text start="1906.21" dur="3.21">which was on the 4-hour body right</text><text start="1908.16" dur="4.11">didn&apos;t Tim Ferriss write about that</text><text start="1909.42" dur="4.62">quite a bit probably yeah it&apos;s a common</text><text start="1912.27" dur="3.12">nootropic it&apos;s a plant derived</text><text start="1914.04" dur="2.46">neurotropic there are other things that</text><text start="1915.39" dur="2.97">are also acetylcholine esterase</text><text start="1916.5" dur="4.14">inhibitors both pharmaceutical and</text><text start="1918.36" dur="3.81">plant-based and what that&apos;s doing is</text><text start="1920.64" dur="2.91">there&apos;s an enzyme in the synapse oh</text><text start="1922.17" dur="2.79">you&apos;re talking about between the axon</text><text start="1923.55" dur="3.12">and the dendrite right in the synaptic</text><text start="1924.96" dur="3.03">cleft there&apos;s an enzyme that breaks down</text><text start="1926.67" dur="2.7">acetylcholine so you don&apos;t have</text><text start="1927.99" dur="2.79">excessive amounts of it but it can also</text><text start="1929.37" dur="2.76">break it down too fast so you then end</text><text start="1930.78" dur="3.03">up having deficient amounts with that</text><text start="1932.13" dur="3.84">cause brain fog if it&apos;s too fast in the</text><text start="1933.81" dur="3.6">breakdown it can write but it&apos;s</text><text start="1935.97" dur="3.87">important brain fog doesn&apos;t have one</text><text start="1937.41" dur="3.93">cause has lots of causes it can be from</text><text start="1939.84" dur="3.18">neuro inflammation it can be from</text><text start="1941.34" dur="4.41">deficiency or excess of lots of</text><text start="1943.02" dur="5.31">different neurotransmitters so but that</text><text start="1945.75" dur="5.31">could be one of them so you can actually</text><text start="1948.33" dur="4.47">inhibit that enzyme so the same amount</text><text start="1951.06" dur="3.48">of acetylcholine that is coming out of</text><text start="1952.8" dur="3.27">the axon can actually get across the</text><text start="1954.54" dur="2.82">synapse more effectively that&apos;s one</text><text start="1956.07" dur="2.94">thing you could do if you&apos;re asking</text><text start="1957.36" dur="3.18">what&apos;s happening chemically so in</text><text start="1959.01" dur="3.39">acetylcholine esterase inhibitor would</text><text start="1960.54" dur="4.2">be one way to modulate the acetylcholine</text><text start="1962.4" dur="3.54">pathway but once it gets across the</text><text start="1964.74" dur="3.3">synapse it&apos;s going to be actually</text><text start="1965.94" dur="5.16">getting up taken in the postsynaptic</text><text start="1968.04" dur="4.65">neuron in various receptors and so we</text><text start="1971.1" dur="2.82">could modulate one of those receptors so</text><text start="1972.69" dur="4.86">we can use things like rasa Tam&apos;s</text><text start="1973.92" dur="6.42">piracetam aniracetam etc to upregulate</text><text start="1977.55" dur="5.07">say the acetylcholine uptake on the nmda</text><text start="1980.34" dur="3.15">complex that&apos;s another thing that we</text><text start="1982.62" dur="2.64">could do we could do those in</text><text start="1983.49" dur="4.41">combination or separately we could</text><text start="1985.26" dur="4.29">actually provide more choline donors or</text><text start="1987.9" dur="5.25">acetyl donors for the body to make more</text><text start="1989.55" dur="6.18">acetylcholine we could provide the the</text><text start="1993.15" dur="4.89">catalysts like vitamin b5 and other</text><text start="1995.73" dur="4.56">things that helps take calling in</text><text start="1998.04" dur="4.32">acetylated so there&apos;s a lot of things</text><text start="2000.29" dur="3.87">that we can do to affect the</text><text start="2002.36" dur="4.08">acetylcholine pathway and that&apos;s just</text><text start="2004.16" dur="4.32">one pathway then there&apos;s two stages why</text><text start="2006.44" dur="4.26">taking the first stage

dur="4.41">regulation we wanted to avoid that we</text><text start="2071.2" dur="4.83">could assess then we wanted to see what</text><text start="2073.99" dur="3.51">portion of that could we do in a

that kind of customization at</text><text start="2080.8" dur="2.879">scale is very difficult and there&apos;s some</text><text start="2082.629" dur="3.451">things that we couldn&apos;t work

dur="3.72">for someone is too harmful to other</text><text start="2089.26" dur="4.83">people but we want to see which dynamics</text><text start="2091.389" dur="4.651">can we work with effectively

dur="4.5">that just goes to Zenith and then we can</text><text start="3752.96" dur="2.52">get afraid well it&apos;s never gonna end I&apos;m</text><text start="3754.369" dur="2.521">gonna be stuck in
