very</text><text start="14.309" dur="4.711">mind-expanding and inspirational but I</text><text start="16.859" dur="3.691">think this one is particularly important</text><text start="19.02" dur="3.39">because he talks about some of the most</text><text start="20.55" dur="4.559">pressing issues that we face on our</text><text start="22.41" dur="4.379">planet today and proposes some ways

talking about existential risks</text><text start="135.73" dur="3.27">which is a topic I know you&apos;re quite</text><text start="137.68" dur="3.36">familiar with that you know you&apos;ve</text><text start="139.0" dur="3.63">brought up in past episodes with us so</text><text start="141.04" dur="2.97">this is something I&apos;ve actually really</text><text start="142.63" dur="3.6">been looking forward to getting into</text><text start="144.01" dur="5.31">with you great so why don&apos;t we start</text><text start="146.23" dur="4.92">with the big questions what are some of</text><text start="149.32" dur="3.57">the biggest existential risks that we</text><text start="151.15" dur="3.3">are facing on the planet right now so</text><text start="152.89" dur="3.629">for those who aren&apos;t familiar the term</text><text start="154.45" dur="4.349">existential risk means some risks that</text><text start="156.519" dur="4.021">could stop us from existing so a species</text><text start="158.799" dur="3.331">threatening event there&apos;s also plenty of</text><text start="160.54" dur="3.509">catastrophic risks that would just</text><text start="162.13" dur="3.419">really suck even though we wouldn&apos;t be</text><text start="164.049" dur="3.601">completely wiped out as a species so</text><text start="165.549" dur="3.991">there are versions of world war three</text><text start="167.65" dur="3.209">that are existential kinds of nuclear</text><text start="169.54" dur="3.449">holocaust that nobody makes it through</text><text start="170.859" dur="4.621">there are kinds of world war three that</text><text start="172.989" dur="4.171">are catastrophic meaning some group of</text><text start="175.48" dur="3.72">people in remote areas make it through</text><text start="177.16" dur="3.9">but the atmosphere holds you rhenium and</text><text start="179.2" dur="4.74">you know most of the people did very</text><text start="181.06" dur="5.58">poorly so we&apos;re kind of interested in</text><text start="183.94" dur="4.769">preventing all of those things right so</text><text start="186.64" dur="3.96">what are the categories first there&apos;s</text><text start="188.709" dur="4.381">different ways of kind of chunking and</text><text start="190.6" dur="4.38">different ways of doing taxonomy one</text><text start="193.09" dur="4.979">thing we can look at is start by saying</text><text start="194.98" dur="4.229">there are kind of human-induced things</text><text start="198.069" dur="2.881">and then there&apos;s kind of natural</text><text start="199.209" dur="5.071">phenomena the natural phenomena are</text><text start="200.95" dur="5.34">things that either arise from within our</text><text start="204.28" dur="3.57">earth and biosphere or outside of it so</text><text start="206.29" dur="3.779">outside of it is things like solar</text><text start="207.85" dur="4.41">flares and Carrington events asteroids</text><text start="210.069" dur="4.291">that can be catastrophic or existential</text><text start="212.26" dur="3.99">and obviously</text><text start="214.36" dur="3.99">you know within our atmosphere most of</text><text start="216.25" dur="3.96">the natural phenomena that would occur</text><text start="218.35" dur="4.74">would not be existential but there are</text><text start="220.21" dur="5.76">some super caldera kinds of scenarios</text><text start="223.09" dur="5.37">that would be we&apos;re obviously interested</text><text start="225.97" dur="4.02">in any of them because you know if if</text><text start="228.46" dur="4.2">there was an event that we just couldn&apos;t</text><text start="229.99" dur="4.23">avoid here then Mars colony moves up on</text><text start="232.66" dur="3.87">the priority list right mm-hmm</text><text start="234.22" dur="4.5">but surprisingly most of these things if</text><text start="236.53" dur="3.72">we have more Intel about them many of</text><text start="238.72" dur="3.33">them can be avoided or at least</text><text start="240.25" dur="3.3">mitigated against so for instance if we</text><text start="242.05" dur="4.32">look at something like a Carrington</text><text start="243.55" dur="6.659">event or we&apos;re looking at solar flares</text><text start="246.37" dur="6.71">or coronal mass ejections that besides</text><text start="250.209" dur="7.951">the just effect that they would have on</text><text start="253.08" dur="7.27">biology directly would also have effects</text><text start="258.16" dur="4.38">on electrical circuitry as far as</text><text start="260.35" dur="3.9">biology goes there might be a impact on</text><text start="262.54" dur="3.629">one part of the planet people can go</text><text start="264.25" dur="3.75">underground it&apos;s not that big a deal but</text><text start="266.169" dur="3.181">as far as frying the circuitry goes if</text><text start="268.0" dur="3.419">we&apos;re talking about frying the circuitry</text><text start="269.35" dur="3.6">of nuclear cooling stations on the power</text><text start="271.419" dur="3.75">plant so then they turn into nuclear</text><text start="272.95" dur="4.32">volcanoes that&apos;s a pretty big deal now</text><text start="275.169" dur="4.351">we could of course do things to mitigate</text><text start="277.27" dur="5.04">against the sensitivity there like</text><text start="279.52" dur="5.19">hardening the nuclear cooling stations</text><text start="282.31" dur="5.19">and you know other forms of key</text><text start="284.71" dur="3.72">infrastructure so even with regard to</text><text start="287.5" dur="3.03">things that we can call natural</text><text start="288.43" dur="3.72">phenomena obviously you know there are</text><text start="290.53" dur="3.63">projects that are looking at asteroids</text><text start="292.15" dur="3.84">and other near-earth objects because</text><text start="294.16" dur="3.509">depending upon what we see they might</text><text start="295.99" dur="3.929">actually be movable and there are a</text><text start="297.669" dur="4.381">number of projects focused on that then</text><text start="299.919" dur="4.231">we move our attention to you know human</text><text start="302.05" dur="4.23">induced things and we can look at the</text><text start="304.15" dur="5.34">ones that go through environmental</text><text start="306.28" dur="5.55">pathways basically we either through</text><text start="309.49" dur="4.77">biodiversity loss or climate change</text><text start="311.83" dur="3.81">ocean acidification or other kinds of</text><text start="314.26" dur="3.6">effects on our biosphere we create a</text><text start="315.64" dur="3.839">biosphere that is uninhabitable to</text><text start="317.86" dur="4.89">humans but we don&apos;t even have to get to</text><text start="319.479" dur="5.761">full uninhabitable &apos;ti for partial</text><text start="322.75" dur="4.83">uninhabitable &apos;ti to lead to the</text><text start="325.24" dur="3.87">beginning of cascade effects you know</text><text start="327.58" dur="4.77">when we look at what happened in Syria</text><text start="329.11" dur="4.68">we see that a major part of what</text><text start="332.35" dur="3.78">happened in factoring there were many</text><text start="333.79" dur="4.05">many factors simultaneously but one part</text><text start="336.13" dur="4.86">of it was drought in an area that had</text><text start="337.84" dur="5.699">not had droughts led to subsistence</text><text start="340.99" dur="4.41">farmers moving into the cities the tax</text><text start="343.539" dur="2.861">to the resource capacity of those cities</text><text start="345.4" dur="2.65">beyond their limits</text><text start="346.4" dur="4.26">led to resource Wars that led to</text><text start="348.05" dur="4.35">factions and that whole kind of thing so</text><text start="350.66" dur="4.77">when we start looking at climate change</text><text start="352.4" dur="6.12">creating massive numbers of refugees and</text><text start="355.43" dur="5.459">the refugee dynamics leading to war</text><text start="358.52" dur="4.26">dynamics and resource footage Wars</text><text start="360.889" dur="4.951">economic collapse and then you know</text><text start="362.78" dur="5.22">cascading Wars you can have scenarios</text><text start="365.84" dur="5.04">where environmental phenomena are the</text><text start="368.0" dur="5.34">first step in a series of cascades that</text><text start="370.88" dur="4.319">can occur so you&apos;ve got all of the</text><text start="373.34" dur="3.84">environmental phenomenon the effects of</text><text start="375.199" dur="4.021">on coral of ocean temperature ocean</text><text start="377.18" dur="4.14">acidification the loss of big fish in</text><text start="379.22" dur="3.569">the trophic cascades key species</text><text start="381.32" dur="3.48">collapse throughout many different</text><text start="382.789" dur="3.66">dynamics pollinators like there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="384.8" dur="4.23">there&apos;s a lot of things in there then we</text><text start="386.449" dur="5.581">can look at other reasons for just human</text><text start="389.03" dur="5.22">induced violence towards each other so</text><text start="392.03" dur="5.55">all of the reasons that something like a</text><text start="394.25" dur="6.0">World War three and we see right now the</text><text start="397.58" dur="5.04">United States leaving its position of</text><text start="400.25" dur="4.11">clear supremacy as a superpower</text><text start="402.62" dur="3.93">we see China moving up into that</text><text start="404.36" dur="4.55">position we have rarely seen transitions</text><text start="406.55" dur="4.619">of power go smoothly in the history of</text><text start="408.91" dur="5.319">civilization and we&apos;ve never had</text><text start="411.169" dur="5.011">transitions of power be at this kind of</text><text start="414.229" dur="4.41">global level and with existential level</text><text start="416.18" dur="4.14">technologies and with over seven billion</text><text start="418.639" dur="3.96">people and with a biosphere near</text><text start="420.32" dur="4.29">collapse and near fragility points like</text><text start="422.599" dur="3.661">we&apos;re in a very different place but even</text><text start="424.61" dur="3.42">when just there was a local hegemony</text><text start="426.26" dur="3.51">where the power was moving from one kind</text><text start="428.03" dur="4.8">of local power to another those were</text><text start="429.77" dur="4.709">usually not easy transition so lots of</text><text start="432.83" dur="4.41">different scenarios and then there are</text><text start="434.479" dur="4.62">the exponential tech scenarios where</text><text start="437.24" dur="4.22">different kinds of exponential</text><text start="439.099" dur="5.19">technology exponential technology means</text><text start="441.46" dur="4.57">exponentially increased power to affect</text><text start="444.289" dur="5.1">stuff and whether we&apos;re talking about</text><text start="446.03" dur="5.22">through AI or through CRISPR and biotech</text><text start="449.389" dur="4.141">or through nanotech you know or through</text><text start="451.25" dur="4.56">robotics if we have exponentially</text><text start="453.53" dur="5.04">increasing ability to affect stuff</text><text start="455.81" dur="4.979">without exponentially increasing good</text><text start="458.57" dur="5.79">choice making that is just self</text><text start="460.789" dur="5.31">terminating no matter what and that is</text><text start="464.36" dur="4.98">the scenario we have right now so</text><text start="466.099" dur="5.63">exponential tech can lead to existential</text><text start="469.34" dur="6.06">scenarios on purpose or on accident</text><text start="471.729" dur="6.31">right you can have just much more</text><text start="475.4" dur="4.079">powerful kind of capacities military</text><text start="478.039" dur="2.011">capacities and much more powerful</text><text start="479.479" dur="2.821">capacity</text><text start="480.05" dur="4.769">that even smaller actors are able to get</text><text start="482.3" dur="4.35">nuclear bomb started off as such a</text><text start="484.819" dur="3.421">difficult thing that only huge date</text><text start="486.65" dur="3.18">actors could have it those state actors</text><text start="488.24" dur="3.269">could watch each other you could have a</text><text start="489.83" dur="3.57">mutually assured destruction system so</text><text start="491.509" dur="3.271">nobody can use it but as you start to</text><text start="493.4" dur="3.15">have exponential tech that becomes</text><text start="494.78" dur="4.19">distributed where smaller and smaller</text><text start="496.55" dur="5.519">actors have access to larger and larger</text><text start="498.97" dur="5.08">potential to affect things the ability</text><text start="502.069" dur="3.801">to avoid that happening gets harder and</text><text start="504.05" dur="3.899">harder and then you also have</text><text start="505.87" dur="4.479">exponential tech that leads to</text><text start="507.949" dur="4.71">existential scenarios accidentally so</text><text start="510.349" dur="4.56">most of the AI risks that boström lays</text><text start="512.659" dur="4.351">out in super intelligence the gray goo</text><text start="514.909" dur="4.68">risks that Drexler lays out you know</text><text start="517.01" dur="4.709">these are mostly where we create in</text><text start="519.589" dur="5.611">autopoietic system we create a self</text><text start="521.719" dur="5.941">fueling system that has a faster</text><text start="525.2" dur="4.35">feedback loop is more adaptive than</text><text start="527.66" dur="4.56">biology and not commensurate with</text><text start="529.55" dur="5.34">biology and so we have to avoid</text><text start="532.22" dur="4.83">accidental extinction as well as on</text><text start="534.89" dur="3.6">purpose extinction you know that&apos;s kind</text><text start="537.05" dur="4.95">of a rough lay of the land of the</text><text start="538.49" dur="5.67">categories of existential risk now if we</text><text start="542.0" dur="4.11">take a step back from it we can say all</text><text start="544.16" dur="4.35">of these categories have some things in</text><text start="546.11" dur="4.11">common some deeper underlying drivers</text><text start="548.51" dur="4.53">that are actually the real existential</text><text start="550.22" dur="5.34">concerns because if at this level the</text><text start="553.04" dur="4.53">scenarios are basically countless but if</text><text start="555.56" dur="4.41">we go deeper one way of saying it is</text><text start="557.57" dur="4.98">that the real existential risk is a loss</text><text start="559.97" dur="5.67">of sense making loss of the ability to</text><text start="562.55" dur="6.36">actually make sense of the world around</text><text start="565.64" dur="5.1">us and what is worth doing what the</text><text start="568.91" dur="3.6">likely effects of things will be what</text><text start="570.74" dur="4.05">the effects of our actions are now and</text><text start="572.51" dur="4.29">so let me think about it</text><text start="574.79" dur="4.14">how long do we have with ocean</text><text start="576.8" dur="4.95">acidification before the coral die right</text><text start="578.93" dur="4.59">now the thoughts on that vary so widely</text><text start="581.75" dur="4.26">that it&apos;s either the most important</text><text start="583.52" dur="5.759">issue or we have quite a bit of time and</text><text start="586.01" dur="5.34">is Fukushima really close to releasing a</text><text start="589.279" dur="4.351">lot of radiation or not and can North</text><text start="591.35" dur="5.04">Korea&apos;s nuclear each certain places or</text><text start="593.63" dur="6.03">not and what are the real risks with AGI</text><text start="596.39" dur="5.85">parasitic AI etcetera like if we don&apos;t</text><text start="599.66" dur="5.31">have better ability to make sense of</text><text start="602.24" dur="4.17">these things then they just all fail</text><text start="604.97" dur="3.239">scenarios right because we don&apos;t know</text><text start="606.41" dur="3.75">how to prioritize what should actually</text><text start="608.209" dur="3.601">get attention paid to it and what could</text><text start="610.16" dur="2.58">be successful and what&apos;s not likely to</text><text start="611.81" dur="3.35">be successful</text><text start="612.74" dur="5.25">so we can say that a lack of information</text><text start="615.16" dur="5.68">coherence is one of the things that is</text><text start="617.99" dur="4.97">at the heart of

dur="3.84">think about like getting towards the</text><text start="673.01" dur="3.66">tipping point of climate change where if</text><text start="675.23" dur="3.84">we you know we get to a

about</text><text start="699.05" dur="3.93">what&apos;s essential is like we said</text><text start="700.42" dur="4.72">exponential technology it&apos;s very hard</text><text start="702.98" dur="4.44">for people&apos;s intuition to grasp what an</text><text start="705.14" dur="4.38">exponential curve is because most of the</text><text start="707.42" dur="4.59">things we experience

start="745.04" dur="3.24">relates to one of the</text><text start="746.51" dur="4.77">questions I was going to ask what do we</text><text start="748.28" dur="5.31">do about the sort of

dur="6.0">corporate interests and producing</text><text start="758.99" dur="5.01">disinformation but there&apos;s also you know</text><text start="762.2" dur="4.38">bad educational systems that

that</text><text start="808.04" dur="3.42">they wrote is complete gibberish they</text><text start="809.66" dur="4.05">made it up with technical sounding words</text><text start="811.46" dur="4.86">but it&apos;s actually gibberish and it goes</text><text start="813.71" dur="3.78">through the publication process because</text><text start="816.32" dur="2.88">they came from the right

dur="4.29">broken</text><text start="821.6" dur="6.69">we&apos;ve also seen where you know stats</text><text start="825.35" dur="5.19">like 50% of the articles posted in</text><text start="828.29"

start="850.25" dur="4.74">yeah is a broken sense making system</text><text start="852.95" dur="3.78">within science if you want to think</text><text start="854.99" dur="3.24">about what the heart of science is like</text><text start="856.73" dur="3.69">what the essence of the philosophy of</text><text start="858.23" dur="5.25">sciences the essence of it is earnest</text><text start="860.42" dur="6.15">inquiry right like earnest desire to</text><text start="863.48" dur="5.28">understand the nature of reality and so</text><text start="866.57" dur="4.71">whatever the speed of sound actually is</text><text start="868.76" dur="4.2">I don&apos;t care if it is different than I</text><text start="871.28" dur="3.51">think it is I want to find out there&apos;s a</text><text start="872.96" dur="4.08">certain reverence for reality and</text><text start="874.79" dur="3.14">respect for the nature of what is beyond</text><text start="877.04" dur="2.42">my own idea</text><text start="877.93" dur="3.15">about it or how I can benefit from it</text><text start="879.46" dur="5.46">that is at the heart of the scientific</text><text start="881.08" dur="6.66">impulse but the scientists that need</text><text start="884.92" dur="5.85">paid and the equipment has to come from</text><text start="887.74" dur="5.61">somewhere and if there are some of the</text><text start="890.77" dur="4.439">answers that are more profitable than</text><text start="893.35" dur="3.12">other answers then it&apos;s easier to put</text><text start="895.209" dur="3.121">money into it because I&apos;ll be able to</text><text start="896.47" dur="3.66">get that money back and if an herb or a</text><text start="898.33" dur="3.75">plant has some medicinal property but I</text><text start="900.13" dur="3.93">will never be able to patent it and I</text><text start="902.08" dur="4.62">won&apos;t be able to recoup the money that I</text><text start="904.06" dur="4.26">get from you know the small margins that</text><text start="906.7" dur="2.67">I would put into the research how can we</text><text start="908.32" dur="3.0">afford to pay for it</text><text start="909.37" dur="4.17">but we will with say some synthetic</text><text start="911.32" dur="4.86">thing I can get a patent on and etc</text><text start="913.54" dur="5.07">right so what actually gets researched</text><text start="916.18" dur="4.29">within that structure and how it gets</text><text start="918.61" dur="4.59">researched so you have you have to</text><text start="920.47" dur="4.5">factor how deep those kind of perverse</text><text start="923.2" dur="3.99">incentives end up trickling through the</text><text start="924.97" dur="5.16">whole thing so then you ask a good</text><text start="927.19" dur="5.31">question which is within a system within</text><text start="930.13" dur="4.74">a fundamentally win-lose game-theoretic</text><text start="932.5" dur="5.67">system how do you prevent these issues</text><text start="934.87" dur="5.94">and be able to have real coherency when</text><text start="938.17" dur="5.76">we are incented to withhold information</text><text start="940.81" dur="4.71">and even you know like you&apos;ll you&apos;ll see</text><text start="943.93" dur="3.12">in soccer football whatever someone will</text><text start="945.52" dur="2.85">fake left to try and get the other</text><text start="947.05" dur="2.789">person to go left and then they&apos;ll</text><text start="948.37" dur="3.12">actually go right right like that&apos;s</text><text start="949.839" dur="3.631">disinformation intentional</text><text start="951.49" dur="4.62">disinformation so that you can throw the</text><text start="953.47" dur="6.03">opponent off so you can win this is not</text><text start="956.11" dur="5.58">different in corporations or nations</text><text start="959.5" dur="3.72">right and Intel and counter Intel and an</text><text start="961.69" dur="5.04">intentional disinformation same thing</text><text start="963.22" dur="5.04">but with global level consequence so</text><text start="966.73" dur="5.12">here&apos;s another good way of thinking</text><text start="968.26" dur="6.21">about it think about early tribes as</text><text start="971.85" dur="4.63">competitive teams almost like a sports</text><text start="974.47" dur="3.6">team where they have to work really well</text><text start="976.48" dur="3.66">together and be very coherent with each</text><text start="978.07" dur="3.81">other to be able to compete with other</text><text start="980.14" dur="3.93">teams and military conflicts when they</text><text start="981.88" dur="4.29">occur and compete with the other teams</text><text start="984.07" dur="4.889">for scarce resources in the shared</text><text start="986.17" dur="4.289">environment the shared Commons say they</text><text start="988.959" dur="2.851">they weren&apos;t military right they&apos;re just</text><text start="990.459" dur="3.091">doing their own thing there&apos;s plenty of</text><text start="991.81" dur="3.93">abundance but then if any of them</text><text start="993.55" dur="3.99">realize that they can do this military</text><text start="995.74" dur="3.24">thing go kill another tribe take their</text><text start="997.54" dur="3.9">stuff and get the riverfront that they</text><text start="998.98" dur="4.349">had or get whatever kinds of things they</text><text start="1001.44" dur="4.26">had acquired and developed that actually</text><text start="1003.329" dur="4.471">worked for them work better now everyone</text><text start="1005.7" dur="4.2">else has to build defensive militaries</text><text start="1007.8" dur="3.45">at least otherwise they lose by default</text><text start="1009.9" dur="3.45">and so one of the things</text><text start="1011.25" dur="5.31">get in the history of win-lose game</text><text start="1013.35" dur="5.01">theory is that one it worked you could</text><text start="1016.56" dur="4.08">actually go kill the other people take</text><text start="1018.36" dur="4.92">their stuff and make stuff better for</text><text start="1020.64" dur="4.53">you and you know your people and two if</text><text start="1023.28" dur="3.75">you didn&apos;t play win lose game theory and</text><text start="1025.17" dur="4.289">someone else did you lost by default</text><text start="1027.03" dur="5.039">right which is why most of the more</text><text start="1029.459" dur="5.61">peaceable less militaristic cultures got</text><text start="1032.069" dur="4.5">wiped out so then we say you know one of</text><text start="1035.069" dur="2.701">the tribes is just bigger and stronger</text><text start="1036.569" dur="2.76">than us we&apos;re not going to be able to</text><text start="1037.77" dur="3.36">compete with them but if two or three of</text><text start="1039.329" dur="3.691">us smaller tribes band together we can</text><text start="1041.13" dur="3.54">but then of course the other side has to</text><text start="1043.02" dur="3.299">compete so they band together and so now</text><text start="1044.67" dur="3.0">we move from tribes to villages right</text><text start="1046.319" dur="3.601">and then we can move up two kingdoms</text><text start="1047.67" dur="2.94">into nation-states into global economic</text><text start="1049.92" dur="3.06">trading bloc&apos;s</text><text start="1050.61" dur="4.95">I mean think about those evolutions of</text><text start="1052.98" dur="5.16">what we think of as like civilization</text><text start="1055.56" dur="4.68">structures as evolutions of competitive</text><text start="1058.14" dur="4.65">teams within a win-lose game theoretic</text><text start="1060.24" dur="4.05">structure that have more and more power</text><text start="1062.79" dur="3.21">to be able to out-compete the other one</text><text start="1064.29" dur="3.24">and that&apos;s both have more people that</text><text start="1066.0" dur="3.78">can be coherent with each other against</text><text start="1067.53" dur="4.41">the other one right so then where as a</text><text start="1069.78" dur="3.33">nation where a team competing against</text><text start="1071.94" dur="2.97">the other one we have a shared</text><text start="1073.11" dur="3.99">military-industrial complex paid for by</text><text start="1074.91" dur="3.69">taxes whatever or as a religion or a</text><text start="1077.1" dur="3.75">race so we can have some overlapping</text><text start="1078.6" dur="4.77">teams but once you get to the point</text><text start="1080.85" dur="4.02">where all of the teams are stepping up</text><text start="1083.37" dur="3.09">simultaneously that&apos;s the kind of</text><text start="1084.87" dur="3.63">evolutionary driver they&apos;re stepping up</text><text start="1086.46" dur="4.5">in their power once you get to the point</text><text start="1088.5" dur="6.39">that you have exponential technological</text><text start="1090.96" dur="5.49">power on multiple teams where the amount</text><text start="1094.89" dur="4.62">of power that it would take to actually</text><text start="1096.45" dur="5.07">win would require destroying the playing</text><text start="1099.51" dur="3.39">field which becomes inevitable right</text><text start="1101.52" dur="3.09">inevitably power will keep increasing</text><text start="1102.9" dur="3.51">until it&apos;s actually bigger than the</text><text start="1104.61" dur="4.29">playing field can tolerate and then</text><text start="1106.41" dur="5.34">winning pretty much means losing because</text><text start="1108.9" dur="4.26">there is nothing left to win right so</text><text start="1111.75" dur="3.24">right now we&apos;re at a place where the</text><text start="1113.16" dur="3.48">super powers of the world cannot win a</text><text start="1114.99" dur="3.87">war against each other when you have</text><text start="1116.64" dur="3.57">hundreds of times the nuclear capacity</text><text start="1118.86" dur="3.09">necessary to kill all life on

start="1140.67" dur="3.989">when you say why did we ever get more</text><text start="1142.74" dur="3.929">than five times as many nukes as we</text><text start="1144.659" dur="3.99">to kill all life

smart idea or was that</text><text start="1155.97" dur="3.809">because we had a for-profit</text><text start="1156.899" dur="4.59">military-industrial complex that makes</text><text start="1159.779"

with regard to sense</text><text start="2108.44" dur="4.41">making there&apos;s a lot of core things that</text><text start="2110.87" dur="4.17">are changing in terms of our capacity</text><text start="2112.85" dur="5.16">for sense making you know we have the</text><text start="2115.04" dur="4.68">ability to have IOT sensors right</text><text start="2118.01" dur="3.96">Internet of Things

dur="3.96">chemistry and Fisheries in the Commons</text><text start="2125.84" dur="4.41">and etc and we have deep learning</text><text start="2127.85" dur="4.02">systems it can be synthesizing that</text><text start="2130.25" dur="3.96">information we like we never had sense</text><text start="2131.87" dur="3.84">making systems like that like we didn&apos;t</text><text start="2134.21" dur="3.51">even have the technological capacity for</text><text start="2135.71" dur="4.05">things like that and choice making</text><text start="2137.72" dur="3.99">systems so basically we are at the face</text><text start="2139.76" dur="4.05">of deeper issues and we&apos;ve ever been at</text><text start="2141.71" dur="4.68">the face of before but also with deeper</text><text start="2143.81" dur="4.62">capacities so the same increased</text><text start="2146.39" dur="5.34">technological capacity that if we keep</text><text start="2148.43" dur="5.46">using it to take complex things and

those core social structures</text><text start="2169.7" dur="5.04">and create coherency based social</text><text start="2171.98" dur="6.03">structures where that technology can be</text><text start="2174.74" dur="5.61">used for not against then I mean we</text><text start="2178.01" dur="3.87">really do have a fork between radically</text><text start="2180.35" dur="6.15">better than anything we&apos;ve ever</text><text start="2181.88" dur="6.69">experienced or catastrophic well so now</text><text start="2186.5" dur="4.44">my question is we talk about all these</text><text start="2188.57" dur="6.06">different structures that we can create</text><text start="2190.94" dur="6.0">for humanity to exist within but there&apos;s</text><text start="2194.63" dur="4.14">also human nature and not just human</text><text start="2196.94" dur="4.83">nature but the nature of something being</text><text start="2198.77" dur="6.54">alive as essentially being a replicator</text><text

no matter how</text><text start="2211.579" dur="5.01">you structure the system we&apos;re going to</text><text start="2213.739" dur="4.77">default to those tendencies for example</text><text start="2216.589" dur="3.75">you know that&apos;s probably one of the</text><text start="2218.509" dur="3.78">reasons why communism didn&apos;t work it</text><text start="2220.339" dur="4.111">just in some ways it probably went</text><text start="2222.289" dur="4.861">against human nature or the nature of</text><text start="2224.45" dur="6.349">just a lot of things that are alive so</text><text start="2227.15" dur="6.119">how do we deal with that in your opinion</text><text start="2230.799" dur="5.56">that&apos;s not why communism didn&apos;t work</text><text start="2233.269" dur="4.53">though yes there were things about the</text><text start="2236.359" dur="3.12">way it was structured that did not</text><text start="2237.799" dur="3.151">structure themselves well with humans</text><text start="2239.479" dur="3.54">but it&apos;s important to get that it wasn&apos;t</text><text start="2240.95" dur="3.69">like it wasn&apos;t a good structure and</text><text start="2243.019" dur="2.85"> up human nature was the problem</text><text start="2244.64" dur="3.24">if that it actually wasn&apos;t a good</text><text start="2245.869" dur="5.311">structure there were good parts of it</text><text start="2247.88" dur="5.699">but in trying to keep us from having</text><text start="2251.18" dur="4.289">economic inequality because economic</text><text start="2253.579" dur="3.301">inequality would continue to inexorably</text><text start="2255.469" dur="4.05">widen it became a</text><text start="2256.88" dur="5.579">lowest-common-denominator system and it</text><text start="2259.519" dur="4.861">became a system of lack of freedom and</text><text start="2262.459" dur="2.85">some really key ways so yes it was</text><text start="2264.38" dur="2.939">against our nature but is actually</text><text start="2265.309" dur="3.54">against good parts of our nature so then</text><text start="2267.319" dur="4.26">the question is are there shitty

dur="5.73">hardest part of the conversation so far</text><text start="2274.519" dur="7.411">because I&apos;m going to say that what we</text><text start="2278.599" dur="5.76">call human nature is

start="3641.41" dur="4.56">finite games by James Carr says a really</text><text start="3643.78" dur="5.01">great introduction to thinking about</text><text start="3645.97" dur="5.52">what a world

start="3653.14" dur="3.479">economics and governance and social</text><text start="3654.85" dur="5.22">systems and a really profound spiritual</text><text start="3656.619" dur="6.781">book so I recommend that one infinite</text><text start="3660.07" dur="5.58">and finite games and you know books like</text><text start="3663.4" dur="4.77">the collapse of complex societies by</text><text start="3665.65" dur="4.02">Tainter they go through all of the you</text><text start="3668.17" dur="3.03">know civilizations of the past that</text><text start="3669.67" dur="4.32">collapse and how and why they collapse</text><text start="3671.2" dur="4.74">is a very sobering insight for people to</text><text start="3673.99" dur="3.27">realize that you know existential</text><text start="3675.94" dur="2.79">risk of the whole species in a whole</text><text start="3677.26" dur="2.73">global level we&apos;ve never faced before</text><text start="3678.73" dur="3.12">but we have at the level of</text><text start="3679.99" dur="5.49">civilizations and we almost always fail</text><text start="3681.85" dur="5.01">and to kind of understand why so that we</text><text start="3685.48" dur="3.12">can make sure you&apos;re not repeating that</text><text start="3686.86" dur="4.68">that&apos;s actually very valuable very</text><text start="3688.6" dur="5.82">insightful and if people want to read</text><text start="3691.54" dur="4.8">you know about existential risk itself</text><text start="3694.42" dur="3.75">you know going to the future of life</text><text start="3696.34" dur="3.75">Institute or the Cambridge Center for</text><text start="3698.17" dur="3.65">the Study of existential risk places</text><text start="3700.09" dur="3.87">like that and reading their

dur="5.38">the world 3 model it&apos;s surprising how</text><text start="3709.84" dur="3.69">many places the world 3 model was</text><text start="3711.79" dur="3.6">accurate from you know when it was</text><text start="3713.53" dur="3.39">started so there&apos;s still value and</text><text start="3715.39" dur="3.78">limits of growth all of those are good</text><text start="3716.92" dur="3.69">ones if I had to pick one for people to</text><text start="3719.17" dur="3.09">start with from here I&apos;d say infinite</text><text start="3720.61" dur="4.58">and finite games it&apos;s a good start cool</text><text start="3722.26" dur="4.98">thank you I&apos;m gonna pick that up any</text><text start="3725.19" dur="4.24">documentaries or movies or anything</text><text start="3727.24"

dur="4.62">better than this and so I think the</text><text start="3772.9" dur="4.47">documentaries one is called paradise or</text><text start="3775.18" dur="6.03">oblivion one&apos;s called the
