dur="6.0">of process factoring the exponential</text><text start="294.26" dur="6.62">curves involved and what is it because</text><text start="298.28" dur="5.25">some people talk about the shift being</text><text start="300.88" dur="4.57">we can talk about intermit irreal terms</text><text start="303.53" dur="4.23">or we can talk about it in terms of an</text><text start="305.45" dur="4.26">evolution in consciousness or the way</text><text start="307.76" dur="4.05">that we operate what do you sense is</text><text start="309.71" dur="6.42">that leap that we need to make in terms</text><text start="311.81" dur="6.24">of how we operate you actually have to</text><text start="316.13" dur="3.48">think about it on all of those levels to</text><text start="318.05" dur="3.3">be able to make sense of it in a</text><text start="319.61" dur="3.81">meaningful way otherwise it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="321.35" dur="3.39">like asking when we are talking about</text><text start="323.42" dur="2.73">the health of a person whether that</text><text start="324.74" dur="3.12">means the health of their liver or their</text><text start="326.15" dur="2.73">kidneys or their blood it&apos;s like that</text><text start="327.86" dur="2.52">doesn&apos;t even make sense you can&apos;t</text><text start="328.88" dur="4.19">separate those things from each other so</text><text start="330.38" dur="7.02">when I think about what economics is</text><text start="333.07" dur="6.43">economics is our value system codified</text><text start="337.4" dur="3.57">as value equations that determines how</text><text start="339.5" dur="3.9">much we value one thing relative to</text><text start="340.97" dur="4.05">another thing that determines what we&apos;re</text><text start="343.4" dur="4.44">incentivized to do and what we confer</text><text start="345.02" dur="4.41">power to so if a dead whale is worth a</text><text start="347.84" dur="3.21">million dollars on a fishing boat and a</text><text start="349.43" dur="3.84">live whale in the ocean is worth nothing</text><text start="351.05" dur="3.87">that&apos;s a value system codified in a</text><text start="353.27" dur="3.53">value equation that then incentivizes</text><text start="354.92" dur="3.93">behavior but it also incentivizes</text><text start="356.8" dur="4.0">psychopathology right psychopathy</text><text start="358.85" dur="3.68">actually I have to shut empathy down</text><text start="360.8" dur="3.84">because leaving the whale in the ocean</text><text start="362.53" dur="3.28">it I hope she isn&apos;t even gonna stay in</text><text start="364.64" dur="2.67">the ocean another guy&apos;s gonna hunt it</text><text start="365.81" dur="4.05">out right so I&apos;ve got a tragedy of the</text><text start="367.31" dur="3.93">Commons so I have to kind of deaden to</text><text start="369.86" dur="4.44">be able to do the thing that is</text><text start="371.24" dur="4.26">incentivized by the system or somebody</text><text start="374.3" dur="3.96">else does and I&apos;m just not effective in</text><text start="375.5" dur="4.17">the system so you can&apos;t think about the</text><text start="378.26" dur="2.85">evolution of human consciousness and the</text><text start="379.67" dur="2.88">evolution of economics differently but</text><text start="381.11" dur="3.0">if you look at the way economics then</text><text start="382.55" dur="2.46">needs to protect its own profit stream</text><text start="384.11" dur="4.26">in the way it will learn how to</text><text start="385.01" dur="4.53">influence media to control people&apos;s</text><text start="388.37" dur="3.45">sense making frameworks in the way it</text><text start="389.54" dur="3.72">will influence governance again this is</text><text start="391.82" dur="3.57">getting to consciousness or the way it</text><text start="393.26" dur="3.81">will influence legislation on the nature</text><text start="395.39" dur="5.64">of what happens in education to prepare</text><text start="397.07" dur="7.55">people for the work force and so the</text><text start="401.03" dur="7.65">paradigm shift is basically</text><text start="404.62" dur="7.96">everything we need new systems of</text><text start="408.68" dur="5.37">governance if we just I mean we think</text><text start="412.58" dur="3.12">about how much we love the word</text><text start="414.05" dur="5.85">democracy and we love the word democracy</text><text start="415.7" dur="5.46">because it&apos;s better than tyranny and</text><text start="419.9" dur="2.88">it&apos;s better than the other like really</text><text start="421.16" dur="3.81">horrible systems that we&apos;ve experienced</text><text start="422.78" dur="4.05">at any scale but when Winston Churchill</text><text start="424.97" dur="3.66">said democracy is the single worst form</text><text start="426.83" dur="3.84">of governance ever created save for all</text><text start="428.63" dur="4.05">the other forms what he was saying that</text><text start="430.67" dur="4.17">was really insightful was that getting</text><text start="432.68" dur="3.93">lots of humans to agree on anything is</text><text start="434.84" dur="3.12">just a hard thing to do and we suck at</text><text start="436.61" dur="3.24">it and we&apos;ve never actually done a good</text><text start="437.96" dur="4.38">job at it and this is a really flawed</text><text start="439.85" dur="3.78">system now we like it because like we</text><text start="442.34" dur="3.35">said it&apos;s overcoming things that were</text><text start="443.63" dur="4.08">even more problematic if you think about</text><text start="445.69" dur="3.43">democracy for a moment and whether we&apos;re</text><text start="447.71" dur="3.3">talking representative democracy or</text><text start="449.12" dur="3.84">liquid democracy using a voting

dur="4.68">everybody to agree beyond a very small</text><text start="457.46" dur="3.72">number of people Dunbar number tribe you</text><text start="460.25" dur="2.13">can get everybody degree because they</text><text start="461.18" dur="3.15">can all be in a conversation together</text><text start="462.38" dur="3.84">beyond the level of which you can have a</text><text start="464.33" dur="3.3">conversation together you can have a few</text><text start="466.22" dur="2.97">people control everything and they can</text><text start="467.63" dur="3.81">be in a conversation together some type</text><text start="469.19" dur="3.72">of oligarchy or meritocracy but then</text><text start="471.44" dur="2.94">you&apos;re like no we want most of the</text><text start="472.91" dur="4.47">people to agree at least right that</text><text start="474.38" dur="4.59">seems like a good idea but somebody puts</text><text start="477.38" dur="2.85">forward a proposition to do something</text><text start="478.97" dur="2.73">that they think is important based on</text><text start="480.23" dur="3.93">their limited sense making that is never</text><text start="481.7" dur="4.14">everything that proposition because it</text><text start="484.16" dur="3.51">wasn&apos;t informed by comprehensive sense</text><text start="485.84" dur="3.63">making will always in the process of</text><text start="487.67" dur="4.32">benefiting something also damage</text><text start="489.47" dur="4.44">something else and so some people love</text><text start="491.99" dur="3.66">it based on if what it&apos;s benefiting is</text><text start="493.91" dur="3.03">directly relevant to them and other</text><text start="495.65" dur="3.21">people hate it based on if what it&apos;s</text><text start="496.94" dur="5.01">damaging is relevant to them you just</text><text start="498.86" dur="4.86">created inexorable polarization because</text><text start="501.95" dur="3.6">you made shitty propositions and then</text><text start="503.72" dur="3.3">ask people to vote yes or no by an Arri</text><text start="505.55" dur="3.51">on a shitty proposition so you notice</text><text start="507.02" dur="3.39">people actually don&apos;t all get to</text><text start="509.06" dur="3.09">contribute to the sense making of what a</text><text start="510.41"

what would</text><text start="515.63" dur="7.5">good mean here and they so really even</text><text start="521.0" dur="3.93">their choice making is just yes or no on</text><text start="523.13"

that now</text><text start="1375.119" dur="2.76">pollinates the plants that the</text><text start="1376.32" dur="3.419">caterpillar decimated across these vast</text><text start="1377.879"

phase</text><text start="1405.389" dur="5.28">shift it comes out when it first can it</text><text start="1409.08" dur="3.299">has finally evolved to the place that it</text><text start="1410.669" dur="2.88">can actually do breast milk rather than</text><text start="1412.379" dur="3.451">get food from the umbilical cord</text><text start="1413.549" dur="3.87">directly but it also comes out when it</text><text start="1415.83" dur="3.149">has to there&apos;s a fairly narrow window of</text><text start="1417.419" dur="2.73">transition the same is true for an</text><text start="1418.979" dur="2.4">animal developing inside of an eggshell</text><text start="1420.149" dur="3.39">or a there&apos;s a finite amount of</text><text start="1421.379" dur="3.51">resources and when it runs out it has to</text><text start="1423.539" dur="2.7">emerge but that&apos;s also the first time</text><text start="1424.889" dur="4.051">that it can emerge that system can</text><text start="1426.239" dur="4.64">handle the transition so we see in</text><text start="1428.94" dur="4.319">nature this kind of precedent that these</text><text start="1430.879" dur="4.12">discrete nonlinear phase shifts because</text><text start="1433.259" dur="3.15">there&apos;s a curve of in utero and then</text><text start="1434.999" dur="3.66">there&apos;s a shift and then there&apos;s a curve</text><text start="1436.409" dur="3.421">outside but that discrete phase shift</text><text start="1438.659" dur="3.33">have come through the birth canal is</text><text start="1439.83" dur="5.789">different than either the phase before</text><text start="1441.989" dur="4.86">after so when you&apos;re asking like or any</text><text start="1445.619" dur="3.331">of the caterpillar is going to be able</text><text start="1446.849" dur="4.471">to do the pollination thing it&apos;s the</text><text start="1448.95" dur="3.75">wrong question right like the the</text><text start="1451.32" dur="4.349">problem that we see is the caterpillars</text><text start="1452.7" dur="6.299">are eating everything that&apos;s true and</text><text start="1455.669" dur="5.01">and that is to gather the resources that</text><text

dur="3.02">advantage and you deploy at everybody</text><text start="1478.71" dur="3.569">sees it reverse engineers it makes</text><text start="1480.289" dur="5.23">modifications on it and you just up the</text><text start="1482.279" dur="6.96">level of rivalry for the entire playing</text><text start="1485.519" dur="5.76">field that itself is what is terminating</text><text start="1489.239" dur="3.721">the seeking of strategic competitive</text><text start="1491.279" dur="3.181">advantage the the rival risk dynamics</text><text start="1492.96" dur="3.9">because that is what actually self</text><text start="1494.46" dur="3.39">terminates with this level of power so</text><text start="1496.86" dur="2.669">it&apos;s how do we take all the</text><text start="1497.85" dur="3.299">technological capacity and start to use</text><text start="1499.529" dur="5.01">it for something that is not trying to</text><text start="1501.149" dur="6.811">have power over but to have

that mean each individual</text><text start="1520.23" dur="4.5">person has to go through that same shift</text><text start="1521.999" dur="7.851">and if so what does that mean well how</text><text
