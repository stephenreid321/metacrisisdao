dur="3.121">so</text><text start="227.68" dur="4.0">the first truly existential tech we had</text><text start="230.0" dur="3.519">in terms of technology enough that we</text><text start="231.68"

start="237.68" dur="4.8">recent in historical time we built an</text><text start="240.48" dur="2.959">entire world system to prevent using</text><text start="242.48" dur="2.479">tech</text><text

superpowers with one catastrophe</text><text start="282.639" dur="3.761">weapon but you can&apos;t on lots and lots of</text><text start="284.72" dur="3.039">non-state actors all having access to</text><text start="286.4" dur="2.72">different kinds of catastrophe weapons</text><text start="287.759" dur="2.641">so how do you deal with that</text><text start="289.12" dur="3.28">so we&apos;re in a situation where the</text><text start="290.4" dur="4.0">post-world war ii world is over there&apos;s</text><text start="292.4" dur="3.68">a lot more catastrophic risks</text><text start="294.4" dur="3.68">and those types of solutions don&apos;t work</text><text start="296.08" dur="3.28">and we need new ones what we&apos;d say is</text><text start="298.08" dur="2.48">that there&apos;s</text><text start="299.36" dur="3.76">so like whether we&apos;re talking about the</text><text start="300.56" dur="6.079">risk from a particular kind of</text><text start="303.12" dur="5.519">ai or bio or nuclear or climate change</text><text start="306.639" dur="2.961">refugees leading to nuclear whatever it</text><text start="308.639" dur="2.641">is</text><text start="309.6" dur="3.12">there&apos;s the increasing catastrophe</text><text start="311.28" dur="4.08">attractor right there&apos;s like an</text><text start="312.72" dur="4.56">attractive basin defined by we can&apos;t</text><text start="315.36" dur="3.6">manage our power well coordination</text><text start="317.28" dur="3.28">failures create increasing catastrophes</text><text start="318.96" dur="3.679">there&apos;s a thousand scenarios but they&apos;re</text><text start="320.56" dur="3.199">all kind of the catastrophe tractor</text><text start="322.639" dur="3.28">then there&apos;s</text><text start="323.759" dur="3.921">this other tractor that says in order to</text><text start="325.919" dur="3.761">manage those we must be able to monitor</text><text start="327.68" dur="4.72">and control adequately and that looks</text><text start="329.68" dur="4.72">like pretty powerful centralized</text><text start="332.4" dur="3.76">control mechanisms which mostly turn</text><text start="334.4" dur="4.32">pretty dystopic so</text><text start="336.16" dur="4.8">we can make sure that nobody builds</text><text start="338.72" dur="3.759">uh catastrophe weapons in their basement</text><text start="340.96" dur="3.679">using tabletop crispr if we have</text><text start="342.479" dur="4.321">ubiquitous surveillance and extremely</text><text start="344.639" dur="4.4">powerful control mechanisms then that</text><text start="346.8" dur="4.239">becomes pretty dystopic so there&apos;s like</text><text start="349.039" dur="3.44">catastrophes and dystopias as these two</text><text start="351.039" dur="3.521">different detractors and exponential</text><text start="352.479" dur="4.081">tech makes both more likely you can run</text><text start="354.56" dur="4.4">much more powerful top-down systems</text><text start="356.56" dur="4.079">using ai and iot</text><text start="358.96" dur="3.92">you can also create a lot worse</text><text start="360.639" dur="4.321">catastrophic dynamics with exponential</text><text start="362.88" dur="4.48">tech so we want a third attractor that</text><text start="364.96" dur="4.4">is neither dystopic nor catastrophic</text><text start="367.36" dur="4.48">and that means that it has to have the</text><text start="369.36" dur="4.16">capacity to check all of the power that</text><text start="371.84" dur="3.199">could cause catastrophe on purpose or</text><text start="373.52" dur="2.88">accident but where that system that</text><text start="375.039" dur="4.081">checks it must also have checks and</text><text start="376.4" dur="5.12">balances and be oriented in a</text><text start="379.12" dur="4.24">life that is somehow desirable</text><text start="381.52" dur="3.76">and so</text><text start="383.36" dur="3.839">how do we make make it through the</text><text start="385.28" dur="4.08">metacrisis means make it through the</text><text start="387.199" dur="3.761">catastrophes and the dystopias</text><text start="389.36" dur="4.8">uh to some kind of third attractor what</text><text start="390.96" dur="4.88">are the criteria of that attractor um</text><text start="394.16" dur="4.319">that would be a fine starting point of</text><text start="395.84" dur="4.24">kind of where i see that we&apos;re at in the</text><text start="398.479" dur="2.471">arc of

dur="6.68">topic it&apos;d be fun to have us explore</text><text start="444.96" dur="4.6">today that&apos;s my kind of initial frame</text><text start="450.319" dur="3.681">i can then add to that that uh the the</text><text start="452.8" dur="3.6">reason why i got really interested in</text><text start="454.0" dur="4.319">daniel&apos;s brain a few years ago was that</text><text start="456.4"

live in</text><text start="462.319" dur="3.521">the middle of a technological revolution</text><text start="464.16" dur="3.68">here was a guy who was even more a</text><text start="465.84"

dur="4.72">here&apos;s a new word right</text><text start="487.84" dur="5.84">please recall that the 20th century was</text><text start="490.4" dur="5.44">was mostly uh used for deconstruction</text><text start="493.68" dur="4.88">you know after the atomic bomb august</text><text start="495.84" dur="4.32">the 6th 1945 the most important date in</text><text start="498.56"

it&apos;s what we call</text><text start="580.88" dur="3.28">the logos</text><text start="582.24" dur="3.599">this is how reality actually operates</text><text start="584.16" dur="3.04">and how we symbolically try to</text><text start="585.839" dur="3.68">understand how the world operates for</text><text start="587.2" dur="4.319">example mathematics you know when</text><text start="589.519" dur="3.841">language tries to be exact that&apos;s when</text><text start="591.519" dur="4.081">we go into the logos</text><text start="593.36" dur="4.08">the second one is pathos you know every</text><text start="595.6" dur="4.08">time somebody tells you do it once more</text><text start="597.44" dur="3.839">with feeling it&apos;s like add the pathos</text><text start="599.68" dur="3.599">please you&apos;re a human being right you&apos;re</text><text start="601.279" dur="4.321">not a machine you do you do it you you</text><text start="603.279" dur="5.12">need to add the pathos to what you do so</text><text start="605.6" dur="4.96">pathos is is the storytelling that&apos;s</text><text start="608.399" dur="4.321">usually banned banned from children&apos;s</text><text start="610.56" dur="4.08">use just like i said that pornography</text><text start="612.72" dur="2.96">violence all of that is located in the</text><text start="614.64" dur="3.52">pathos</text><text start="615.68" dur="4.48">and the third one is the mythos and the</text><text start="618.16" dur="3.6">mythos is the only way for the other two</text><text start="620.16" dur="4.48">to be combined</text><text start="621.76" dur="4.639">so our predicament as both hegel and</text><text start="624.64" dur="4.08">nietzsche pointed out in the 19th</text><text start="626.399" dur="3.921">century is that the only way for us to</text><text start="628.72" dur="4.32">have some kind of a narrative that we</text><text start="630.32" dur="5.28">can share is to create mythos</text><text start="633.04" dur="4.479">not myth but a mythos here so these are</text><text start="635.6" dur="4.479">the three basic stories and they are</text><text start="637.519" dur="4.241">dialectically intertwined you cannot</text><text start="640.079" dur="3.841">focus on one of them rather than the</text><text start="641.76" dur="3.759">other one and then if you look at power</text><text start="643.92" dur="3.359">and domination</text><text start="645.519" dur="4.0">it goes to say that power domination</text><text start="647.279" dur="4.8">goes into these three realms so the</text><text start="649.519" dur="4.88">logos is the symbolic order uh and the</text><text start="652.079" dur="4.0">symbolic it&apos;s more on the masculine side</text><text start="654.399" dur="3.521">of things if you allow us to say that</text><text start="656.079" dur="3.76">but it&apos;s more the masculine side of</text><text start="657.92" dur="3.68">things and the logos how the world</text><text start="659.839" dur="4.161">actually operates zeros and ones today</text><text start="661.6" dur="3.359">more than anything is the logos and and</text><text start="664.0" dur="3.92">then</text><text start="664.959" dur="5.281">that is logos is presented as knowledge</text><text start="667.92" dur="4.56">the power through knowledge whatever&apos;s</text><text start="670.24" dur="4.4">access to knowledge today would say data</text><text start="672.48" dur="4.16">and data processing whoever has control</text><text start="674.64" dur="3.6">over the knowledge or say dominates in</text><text start="676.64" dur="3.52">the knowledge field has enormous power</text><text start="678.24" dur="4.24">and influence and that&apos;s of course we</text><text start="680.16" dur="4.4">need to start today the other one is</text><text start="682.48" dur="4.0">violence itself who has the monopoly of</text><text start="684.56" dur="3.76">violence over specific territory that&apos;s</text><text start="686.48" dur="3.12">state and things like that and that that</text><text start="688.32" dur="2.72">is the pathos</text><text start="689.6" dur="4.0">so that&apos;s the second realm and the path</text><text start="691.04" dur="4.16">of what we call the real order the real</text><text start="693.6" dur="3.359">order of things is ultimately the</text><text start="695.2" dur="3.36">physical world out there that we if you</text><text start="696.959" dur="2.56">walk straight into a wall and hit your</text><text start="698.56" dur="2.959">head</text><text start="699.519" dur="4.641">you you just you just encounter the path</text><text start="701.519" dur="4.081">of the world out there we can fantasize</text><text start="704.16" dur="3.359">all we like and we human beings</text><text start="705.6" dur="3.52">fantasize individually collectively all</text><text start="707.519" dur="3.281">the time but at the end of the day our</text><text start="709.12" dur="3.04">fantasies will be crushed</text><text start="710.8" dur="2.719">and they will be crushed by what&apos;s</text><text start="712.16" dur="3.04">called the pathos</text><text start="713.519" dur="3.361">so that&apos;s the second real the real word</text><text start="715.2" dur="3.36">the third one the only one that can</text><text start="716.88" dur="2.56">unite the other two is the imaginary</text><text start="718.56" dur="3.2">order</text><text start="719.44" dur="4.399">imaginary word is tied to the mythos so</text><text start="721.76" dur="4.0">we imagine the world</text><text start="723.839" dur="3.68">and this is where it gets important</text><text start="725.76" dur="3.28">we have to have an imaginary that makes</text><text start="727.519" dur="2.801">sense to us we have to have a shared</text><text start="729.04" dur="2.4">imagine if you&apos;re going to share a</text><text start="730.32" dur="3.04">society</text><text start="731.44" dur="4.16">and that&apos;s where the crisis at so what&apos;s</text><text start="733.36" dur="4.479">happening right now i would propose is</text><text start="735.6" dur="4.08">that this is a paradigm shift in the</text><text start="737.839" dur="3.361">sense that we&apos;re moving into the online</text><text start="739.68" dur="3.599">world and the internet is taking over</text><text start="741.2" dur="3.52">the world and we&apos;re globalized because</text><text start="743.279" dur="3.36">the internet itself goes towards</text><text start="744.72" dur="3.679">globalization whereas we human beings</text><text start="746.639" dur="4.241">are very local in our attitude towards</text><text start="748.399" dur="4.081">the world so the this one this was</text><text start="750.88" dur="3.44">that&apos;s a paradigm shift so why there&apos;s a</text><text start="752.48" dur="4.56">messed up crisis tied to the paradigm</text><text start="754.32" dur="5.92">shift is that all these three narratives</text><text start="757.04" dur="4.64">are in crisis at the same time daniel is</text><text start="760.24" dur="3.2">the perfect guy in the world right now</text><text start="761.68" dur="3.279">to list the reason why logos is in</text><text start="763.44" dur="3.28">crisis</text><text start="764.959" dur="4.081">that&apos;s exactly what he&apos;s talking about</text><text start="766.72" dur="4.16">after 1945 we&apos;ve discovered that we&apos;re</text><text start="769.04" dur="4.72">exploiting the world towards our own</text><text start="770.88" dur="4.24">extinction and that&apos;s</text><text start="773.76" dur="2.56">that&apos;s not a small thing to say that&apos;s</text><text start="775.12" dur="2.88">exactly what we&apos;re doing we could blow</text><text start="776.32" dur="3.28">ourselves up with the bomb we could also</text><text start="778.0" dur="3.44">blow ourselves up in many other ways and</text><text start="779.6" dur="4.4">just take more time that&apos;s what the</text><text start="781.44" dur="6.56">logos crisis at the problem is the other</text><text start="784.0" dur="6.32">two aspects are in crisis too the pathos</text><text start="788.0" dur="4.24">the pathos is in crisis the mythos is a</text><text start="790.32" dur="4.4">crisis the mythos is in crisis in a very</text><text start="792.24" dur="4.719">particular way it&apos;s a crisis in the</text><text start="794.72" dur="4.559">religious or the spiritual and therefore</text><text start="796.959" dur="4.401">also political manner death has become</text><text start="799.279" dur="3.601">the absolute we now have an elite in the</text><text start="801.36" dur="3.2">world today who believe they really will</text><text start="802.88" dur="2.88">die when they die</text><text start="804.56" dur="3.279">that has never happened before in</text><text start="805.76" dur="4.16">history we have always excused ourselves</text><text start="807.839" dur="4.401">with an afterlife or at least with a</text><text start="809.92" dur="3.84">reincarnation a reincarnation of the</text><text start="812.24" dur="4.0">east of the afterlife of the west we</text><text start="813.76" dur="4.319">have always had those myths before now</text><text start="816.24" dur="3.2">we can no longer have a myth and</text><text start="818.079" dur="4.081">therefore we cannot have a myth that is</text><text start="819.44" dur="4.8">utopian or dystopian either</text><text start="822.16" dur="4.32">we have to accept that we die and we die</text><text start="824.24" dur="3.839">and the only thing that can transcend us</text><text start="826.48" dur="3.039">is children who inherit earth after</text><text start="828.079" dur="3.361">we&apos;re gone</text><text start="829.519" dur="3.361">we&apos;re into that mode that we have now</text><text start="831.44" dur="3.28">elite in the world that have come to</text><text start="832.88" dur="4.399">accept that and they&apos;re dealing with it</text><text start="834.72" dur="4.4">massively and it&apos;s not a small thing at</text><text start="837.279" dur="3.601">all when it&apos;s dealt with collectively</text><text start="839.12" dur="3.12">this is like nietzsche&apos;s the last man</text><text start="840.88" dur="4.079">that&apos;s where we&apos;re located right now so</text><text start="842.24" dur="5.039">there&apos;s a crisis in in the mythos 2</text><text start="844.959" dur="4.481">there&apos;s a crisis in storytelling we can</text><text start="847.279" dur="4.56">deconstruct as much as we like but if we</text><text start="849.44" dur="5.199">don&apos;t reconstruct something valuable to</text><text start="851.839" dur="4.321">us and have a new story we&apos;re done</text><text start="854.639" dur="3.521">and the third one is the crisis and the</text><text start="856.16" dur="4.08">pathos this is the crisis of violence</text><text start="858.16" dur="4.0">this is the crisis of sexuality but this</text><text start="860.24" dur="3.599">is also the crisis of nature itself</text><text start="862.16" dur="3.919">that&apos;s not catching up with us this is</text><text start="863.839" dur="4.321">the crisis of the bomb</text><text start="866.079" dur="4.081">it&apos;s literally physical this is the</text><text start="868.16" dur="4.0">crisis of the climate it&apos;s literally</text><text start="870.16" dur="4.16">physical therefore there&apos;s a crisis in</text><text start="872.16" dur="4.56">the pathos too so all the three</text><text start="874.32" dur="3.44">different narratives are in crisis all</text><text start="876.72" dur="3.52">the three different narratives</text><text start="877.76" dur="4.319">simultaneously have to be retold as a</text><text start="880.24" dur="5.36">new shared neurotrology that makes sense</text><text start="882.079" dur="7.841">to us that&apos;s why there&apos;s a metal crisis</text><text start="885.6" dur="5.28">can i ask you to um just clarify a bit</text><text start="889.92" dur="4.24">for</text><text start="890.88" dur="5.04">what has to happen in logos in pathos</text><text start="894.16" dur="3.679">and mythos like is there something like</text><text start="895.92" dur="4.4">what you would think of as necessary and</text><text start="897.839" dur="4.161">sufficient criteria of the new logos the</text><text start="900.32" dur="5.12">new mythos and the new pathos that</text><text start="902.0" dur="6.639">converges towards a third attractor</text><text start="905.44" dur="5.839">yeah absolutely um the third attractor</text><text start="908.639" dur="4.481">we call protopianism and i think it was</text><text start="911.279" dur="3.441">kelly over at wired who invented the</text><text start="913.12" dur="3.36">term or maybe it&apos;s been around because</text><text start="914.72" dur="4.559">it sounds a bit generic but uh</text><text start="916.48" dur="4.64">protopianism when i came to east asia</text><text start="919.279" dur="3.521">and you travel there too down in a lot</text><text start="921.12" dur="3.36">like when i talk to the japanese the</text><text start="922.8" dur="3.279">korean and the chinese it doesn&apos;t make</text><text start="924.48" dur="3.52">sense to say anything today that they</text><text start="926.079" dur="3.2">don&apos;t get or they don&apos;t subscribe to and</text><text start="928.0" dur="3.44">it certainly makes a lot of sense to</text><text start="929.279" dur="3.521">listen to them and their history right</text><text start="931.44" dur="2.88">uh because we share a world with them</text><text start="932.8" dur="3.36">now uh</text><text start="934.32" dur="4.16">protopianism makes sense to anybody in</text><text start="936.16" dur="4.799">east asia the utopian dystopian</text><text start="938.48" dur="4.32">dichotomy was always western</text><text start="940.959" dur="3.68">and we got it from abrahamic religion it</text><text start="942.8" dur="4.159">doesn&apos;t make sense in india it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="944.639" dur="4.32">make sense in china or japan but the</text><text start="946.959" dur="4.721">protopian perspective which is the</text><text start="948.959" dur="4.721">incremental improvement and work towards</text><text start="951.68" dur="3.36">optimization of processes</text><text start="953.68" dur="2.959">makes sense</text><text start="955.04" dur="3.599">that makes sense globally so i would</text><text start="956.639" dur="4.081">start with saying that all these</text><text start="958.639" dur="4.081">different narratives now have to be</text><text start="960.72" dur="4.08">protopian we need to get rid of the</text><text start="962.72" dur="3.6">utopian to drive towards the token and</text><text start="964.8" dur="2.719">the dystopian which is what you call the</text><text start="966.32" dur="2.959">third attractor which i think is</text><text start="967.519" dur="4.24">brilliant the third attractor is now</text><text start="969.279" dur="4.881">required because it&apos;s the only credible</text><text start="971.759" dur="4.721">global narrative we can have and it goes</text><text start="974.16" dur="5.039">for both the logos and the mythos and</text><text start="976.48" dur="4.719">the pathos they all have to be protopian</text><text start="979.199" dur="3.681">and you and i in one of our little night</text><text start="981.199" dur="3.521">sessions over in california came up with</text><text start="982.88" dur="3.92">the term that i love called symbiotic</text><text start="984.72" dur="4.239">intelligence so i think we should we</text><text start="986.8" dur="3.76">should ai is what the machines will do</text><text start="988.959" dur="3.281">but as long as we human beings are</text><text start="990.56" dur="3.6">involved in collaboration with the</text><text start="992.24" dur="4.8">machines i think it makes more sense to</text><text start="994.16" dur="4.72">speak of an si and essa is an ai</text><text start="997.04" dur="3.76">ultimately controlled by humans serving</text><text start="998.88" dur="3.68">our interests but that takes a lot of</text><text start="1000.8" dur="3.36">maturity from us as well to work with</text><text start="1002.56" dur="3.519">the symbiotic intelligence but if</text><text start="1004.16" dur="3.52">symbiotic intelligence is an</text><text start="1006.079" dur="3.921">intelligence that works towards</text><text start="1007.68" dur="4.719">optimization or process at all times and</text><text start="1010.0" dur="4.959">of course this is not an optimization of</text><text start="1012.399" dur="4.961">a process that&apos;s ultimately exploitative</text><text start="1014.959" dur="4.721">that&apos;s why we use the term implotation</text><text start="1017.36" dur="4.159">in our work all the time you know and we</text><text start="1019.68" dur="4.24">talk about resilience sustainability of</text><text start="1021.519" dur="4.8">these things the implicative aspect has</text><text start="1023.92" dur="4.399">to be implemented within a protopin</text><text start="1026.319" dur="4.24">process meaning that you have to give</text><text start="1028.319" dur="3.76">back what you just used</text><text start="1030.559" dur="2.961">in that sense you cannot exploit the</text><text start="1032.079"

start="1037.839" dur="3.761">exactly employative is opposite to</text><text start="1039.679" dur="3.441">exploitative so it&apos;s easy to understand</text><text start="1041.6" dur="3.28">it&apos;s the opposite of that we used the</text><text start="1043.12" dur="4.4">word for the past 20 years and what&apos;s</text><text start="1044.88" dur="4.08">important here is that protopian

scale</text><text start="1232.88" dur="3.12">and so if you don&apos;t actually think about</text><text start="1234.64" dur="3.84">what are the values that are worth</text><text start="1236.0" dur="4.08">valuing and how do we build tech that</text><text start="1238.48" dur="4.16">enhances those</text><text start="1240.08" dur="4.64">then because the tech is so powerful it</text><text start="1242.64" dur="4.32">will end up damaging them</text><text start="1244.72" dur="4.24">and so you actually can&apos;t think about</text><text start="1246.96" dur="4.32">the evolution of culture independently</text><text start="1248.96" dur="5.28">from the techplex that ends up</text><text start="1251.28" dur="5.44">determining what wins behaviorally</text><text start="1254.24" dur="4.0">i agree so the point here is that</text><text start="1256.72" dur="4.16">engineers have no clue what they&apos;re</text><text start="1258.24" dur="4.0">doing historically so like if you if you</text><text start="1260.88" dur="3.52">would have asked gutenberg about the</text><text start="1262.24" dur="3.76">printing press in 1415 it was quite an</text><text start="1264.4" dur="3.36">event when the printing press arrived i</text><text start="1266.0" dur="4.0">mean they started printing bibles quite</text><text start="1267.76" dur="3.6">quickly to start with and that was his</text><text start="1270.0" dur="3.12">point the point was that you should</text><text start="1271.36" dur="3.36">translate the bible to local dialects</text><text start="1273.12" dur="3.2">around europe so the europeans could</text><text start="1274.72" dur="3.28">read the bible and become all the good</text><text start="1276.32" dur="3.52">catholics that he wanted them to be</text><text start="1278.0" dur="3.52">actually he created the end of the</text><text start="1279.84" dur="3.36">catholic church it&apos;s been it&apos;s been</text><text start="1281.52" dur="3.12">growing gradually but you know the whole</text><text start="1283.2" dur="2.959">question of the catholic church and now</text><text start="1284.64" dur="3.68">is just basically diminishing into</text><text start="1286.159" dur="3.52">nothing started with gutenberg he was</text><text start="1288.32" dur="3.359">the killer of the catholic church he</text><text start="1289.679" dur="3.761">just didn&apos;t know so the problem is that</text><text start="1291.679" dur="4.321">engineers are usually historically</text><text start="1293.44" dur="4.64">speaking very unaware so i just want to</text><text start="1296.0" dur="4.159">remove the sort of the guilt applied to</text><text start="1298.08" dur="3.68">them afterwards like you don&apos;t even know</text><text start="1300.159" dur="2.961">what people do with you i mean nietzsche</text><text start="1301.76" dur="3.12">couldn&apos;t know that hitler would come</text><text start="1303.12" dur="3.76">along and marx couldn&apos;t know that stalin</text><text start="1304.88" dur="3.76">would come along you can&apos;t blame people</text><text start="1306.88" dur="4.64">afterwards what people later are doing</text><text start="1308.64" dur="4.159">in the sense that we usually do so my</text><text start="1311.52" dur="3.2">point is this though that there&apos;s a</text><text start="1312.799" dur="3.36">social responsibility for creating an</text><text start="1314.72" dur="3.6">environment where technology is created</text><text start="1316.159" dur="4.561">in the first place the one thing we&apos;ve</text><text start="1318.32" dur="4.56">learned is that we hardly change at all</text><text start="1320.72" dur="4.24">human beings are basically the same word</text><text start="1322.88" dur="3.44">say five or ten thousand years ago in</text><text start="1324.96" dur="3.44">the very short span to be created</text><text start="1326.32" dur="4.479">civilization what we do create is</text><text start="1328.4" dur="5.279">technology the way i frame it is that i</text><text start="1330.799" dur="4.801">said women give birth to children</text><text start="1333.679" dur="3.041">men envy women for giving birth to</text><text start="1335.6" dur="3.84">children</text><text start="1336.72" dur="4.319">men therefore give birth to technology</text><text start="1339.44" dur="4.08">the problem is that if technology</text><text start="1341.039" dur="3.841">develops quicker than children do which</text><text start="1343.52" dur="2.72">tends to do</text><text start="1344.88" dur="3.76">its only question of time before</text><text start="1346.24" dur="4.48">technology kills the child unless you</text><text start="1348.64" dur="3.36">intervene right so</text><text start="1350.72" dur="4.319">that&apos;s essentially the history of</text><text start="1352.0" dur="5.2">civilization in five sentences uh in a</text><text start="1355.039" dur="4.481">very freudian sense so my point in</text><text start="1357.2" dur="4.16">calling technology value neutral is of</text><text start="1359.52" dur="4.639">course nothing is value neutral in the</text><text start="1361.36" dur="6.24">formal sense but it is to point out that</text><text start="1364.159" dur="5.601">technologies are pharmaconic usually by</text><text start="1367.6" dur="4.559">by historical necessity and then we can</text><text start="1369.76" dur="4.32">look at them today we know more and</text><text start="1372.159" dur="4.561">today the loops of technological</text><text start="1374.08" dur="4.88">innovation are so tight and involve so</text><text start="1376.72" dur="4.48">many people that the pathos of the</text><text start="1378.96" dur="4.719">mythos are obviously now involved in the</text><text start="1381.2" dur="3.68">loop of the logos itself we are really</text><text start="1383.679" dur="3.201">beginning to look at the word</text><text start="1384.88" dur="4.24">dialectically we&apos;re really beginning to</text><text start="1386.88" dur="4.32">look at the world these three narratives</text><text start="1389.12" dur="4.16">are now colliding one another we cannot</text><text start="1391.2" dur="4.24">trust any one of them because as human</text><text start="1393.28" dur="4.72">beings we have to operate all three and</text><text

dur="3.2">not looking at a</text><text start="1406.88" dur="3.2">theory of change we&apos;re looking at an</text><text start="1408.32" dur="4.0">ecosystem of theories of change an</text><text

dur="4.24">so i think we think very much the same</text><text start="1434.559" dur="3.36">way about that uh it&apos;s interesting i</text><text start="1436.799" dur="3.521">want to try to tie a couple things</text><text start="1437.919" dur="4.321">together that you said you</text><text start="1440.32" dur="3.68">were mentioning that uh marx can&apos;t</text><text start="1442.24" dur="3.36">really be blamed for stalin and et</text><text start="1444.0" dur="2.559">cetera because people can&apos;t really</text><text start="1445.6" dur="2.559">forecast what&apos;s going to happen</text><text start="1446.559" dur="2.641">afterwards einstein and the bomb great</text><text start="1448.159" dur="2.64">example</text><text start="1449.2" dur="3.92">um</text><text start="1450.799" dur="3.441">i think it&apos;s true that</text><text start="1453.12" dur="2.799">i was talking with a friend the other</text><text start="1454.24" dur="3.039">day about</text><text start="1455.919" dur="2.961">all

didn&apos;t happen that he was kind of</text><text start="1461.52" dur="5.2">traumatized by um and where their hope</text><text start="1464.159" dur="4.88">and how good they would be uh was false</text><text start="1466.72" dur="4.4">and i said yeah but you also need to</text><text start="1469.039" dur="3.52">equally factor all of the um</text><text start="1471.12" dur="2.64">devastatingly bad things that people</text><text start="1472.559" dur="3.041">forecasted during that time that didn&apos;t</text><text start="1473.76" dur="4.64">happen as well the cuban missile crisis</text><text start="1475.6" dur="4.959">didn&apos;t become world war three and y2k</text><text start="1478.4" dur="4.48">didn&apos;t in the world and 2012 didn&apos;t and</text><text

future</text><text start="1486.0" dur="3.36">because it makes sense that we would we</text><text start="1487.76" dur="4.08">can&apos;t get the weather right 10 days out</text><text start="1489.36" dur="4.319">like multiple embedded complex systems</text><text start="1491.84" dur="3.76">are hard we&apos;re just not going to do that</text><text start="1493.679" dur="3.6">so we have to get recursive intelligence</text><text start="1495.6" dur="3.04">processes that can do a little bit and</text><text start="1497.279" dur="3.121">increase the collective intelligence</text><text

start="1509.84" dur="2.4">of low hanging and it&apos;s really</text><text start="1511.039" dur="2.88">worthwhile</text><text start="1512.24" dur="3.6">and so one thing as you&apos;re mentioning</text><text start="1513.919" dur="3.441">that the engineers i mean i think the</text><text start="1515.84" dur="3.52">engineers have been profoundly competent</text><text start="1517.36" dur="2.96">in the domain that they were trained</text><text start="1519.36" dur="2.319">but</text><text start="1520.32" dur="2.8">as soon as you understand that</text><text start="1521.679" dur="3.041">technology</text><text start="1523.12" dur="3.36">codes patterns of behavior that end up</text><text start="1524.72" dur="4.0">coding minds that then in mass code</text><text start="1526.48" dur="4.079">societies of course technologists have</text><text start="1528.72" dur="2.88">to be trained in social sciences</text><text start="1530.559" dur="3.12">um</text><text start="1531.6" dur="4.72">and axiological design what are the</text><text start="1533.679" dur="4.161">value sets that will emerge from the use</text><text start="1536.32" dur="2.88">of these technologies has to be a</text><text start="1537.84" dur="2.719">consideration doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;ll get it</text><text start="1539.2" dur="3.12">all right but we need to work at it and</text><text start="1540.559" dur="3.521">then recursively work at it and improve</text><text start="1542.32" dur="3.44">the process as we go</text><text start="1544.08" dur="3.28">so i think when you have bigger</text><text start="1545.76" dur="3.2">frameworks like</text><text start="1547.36" dur="3.04">that our superstructure right our</text><text start="1548.96" dur="3.28">collective

dur="2.72">agreement fields in our infrastructure</text><text start="1555.84" dur="2.959">or techplex</text><text start="1557.12" dur="3.12">co-influence each other</text><text start="1558.799"

start="1562.72" dur="4.24">just basic like that really helps</text><text start="1564.72" dur="4.8">right it really helps the forecasting</text><text start="1566.96" dur="4.56">but one other thing i wanted to say</text><text start="1569.52" dur="3.68">is there&apos;s a very interesting thing</text><text start="1571.52" dur="3.44">right now where the argument that we</text><text start="1573.2" dur="3.04">can&apos;t possibly forecast the future well</text><text start="1574.96" dur="2.959">enough ends up being a source of</text><text start="1576.24" dur="3.52">plausible deniability for people

eventually that becomes the state we</text><text start="1806.08" dur="4.64">have today and the state is so far</text><text start="1808.64" dur="4.0">behind and the problem is of course is</text><text

exactly</text><text start="1864.64" dur="4.24">what you said was like we need to create</text><text start="1866.64" dur="4.0">a functioning container within which the</text><text start="1868.88"

dur="3.919">so you have a membrane</text><text start="1933.6" dur="4.16">and containers start with functioning</text><text start="1935.519" dur="3.76">membranes so there are rules how you</text><text

the</text><text start="1948.799" dur="3.12">system we&apos;re looking at as a kind of a</text><text start="1950.32" dur="3.839">bazaar that we need to create for the</text><text start="1951.919" dur="3.521">digital age it starts to make sense then</text><text start="1954.159" dur="2.561">we can have different bazaars that are</text><text start="1955.44" dur="3.119">competing one another but we have to</text><text start="1956.72" dur="4.319">have a central framework for all the</text><text start="1958.559" dur="4.72">bazaars of the world which is how we</text><text start="1961.039" dur="4.161">implotatively use the world in that</text><text start="1963.279" dur="4.4">sense so that we don&apos;t completely go</text><text start="1965.2" dur="3.92">into collapse so the problem is that we</text><text start="1967.679" dur="3.681">both on the global level have to have a</text><text start="1969.12" dur="4.24">network of bazaars and another local</text><text start="1971.36" dur="4.24">level there are the bazaars but what i&apos;m</text><text start="1973.36" dur="5.199">then proposing is that the bazaar looks</text><text start="1975.6" dur="6.559">to its own self-interest long time</text><text start="1978.559" dur="5.681">see it keeps itself alive as a container</text><text start="1982.159" dur="3.841">within which you can put the content and</text><text start="1984.24" dur="4.08">this is why the market will not work</text><text start="1986.0" dur="4.64">unless the market is regulated it has to</text><text start="1988.32" dur="3.76">start there so the

way</text><text start="2355.839" dur="4.0">um</text><text start="2357.52" dur="5.44">so there&apos;s a way that i think about</text><text start="2359.839" dur="6.161">that relative to the world today where</text><text start="2362.96" dur="5.44">it uh it seems like something has</text><text start="2366.0" dur="4.16">changed in scale in a way that crossed</text><text start="2368.4" dur="3.439">the threshold that changed in type where</text><text start="2370.16" dur="3.84">the same thing even in network wouldn&apos;t</text><text start="2371.839" dur="4.321">apply i&apos;d like to ask this question and</text><text start="2374.0" dur="3.28">get your thought on it</text><text start="2376.16" dur="3.199">so</text><text start="2377.28" dur="4.559">you went to the market</text><text start="2379.359" dur="3.921">after talking about the state and then</text><text start="2381.839" dur="3.28">you said okay in the market there was</text><text start="2383.28" dur="2.799">something like law the woman at the</text><text start="2385.119" dur="2.321">front</text><text start="2386.079" dur="3.361">um</text><text start="2387.44" dur="4.0">had some kind of wisdom to be able to</text><text start="2389.44" dur="4.24">assess who you are some record of if you</text><text start="2391.44" dur="3.76">went to the cost dog or not some</text><text start="2393.68" dur="3.76">you know some indicators about you and</text><text start="2395.2" dur="4.159">then obviously she&apos;s probably connected</text><text start="2397.44" dur="3.36">to a network of</text><text start="2399.359" dur="3.041">people who are reporting on what people</text><text start="2400.8" dur="3.519">are doing inside and there&apos;s probably</text><text start="2402.4" dur="2.64">something like police and whatever right</text><text start="2404.319" dur="2.881">so</text><text start="2405.04" dur="4.079">uh if someone is</text><text start="2407.2" dur="2.879">stealing or doing false advertising or</text><text start="2409.119" dur="2.321">whatever it would be that would go</text><text start="2410.079" dur="3.121">against the</text><text start="2411.44" dur="3.52">written or unwritten law of

like rules and</text><text start="2418.24" dur="4.24">there&apos;s something like enforcement</text><text start="2420.4" dur="3.76">which is what defines the membrane and</text><text start="2422.48" dur="4.56">so acting on the inside requires</text><text start="2424.16" dur="5.52">participation of the rule set</text><text start="2427.04" dur="5.12">one of the things that</text><text start="2429.68" dur="4.56">makes that work without being tyrannical</text><text start="2432.16" dur="3.199">is the smallness of scale</text><text start="2434.24" dur="2.0">yes</text><text start="2435.359" dur="3.601">and</text><text start="2436.24" dur="4.16">so unlike a massive police state</text><text start="2438.96" dur="3.2">um if the</text><text start="2440.4" dur="3.439">police in that thing started to get</text><text start="2442.16" dur="3.6">corrupt enough of the people could</text><text start="2443.839" dur="3.841">overthrow the police and</text><text start="2445.76" dur="3.599">um there&apos;s no such thing as a</text><text start="2447.68" dur="2.96">person at a bazaar</text><text start="2449.359" dur="2.24">who can</text><text start="2450.64"

cheaper and i can go touch</text><text start="2460.319" dur="4.321">them by myself right so there&apos;s not a</text><text start="2462.56" dur="4.0">radical asymmetry between billion

dur="2.8">stuff and a dude on the other side</text><text start="2469.28" dur="3.12">buying stuff there&apos;s not that much</text><text start="2470.96" dur="3.84">asymmetry between the police and the</text><text start="2472.4" dur="4.32">non-police and so the symmetry is part</text><text start="2474.8" dur="4.08">of what makes something like caveat m</text><text start="2476.72" dur="3.28">tour

on it or even consent as a</text><text start="2504.079" dur="4.0">valid idea because of things like undue</text><text start="2506.48" dur="3.28">influence what does consent mean if i</text><text

that&apos;s the challenge here</text><text start="2876.24" dur="4.319">it&apos;s unavoidable there has to be some</text><text start="2878.4" dur="4.0">kind of at least loose global you

dur="4.32">so at least we know we have the gaia we</text><text start="2908.88" dur="4.239">have we have that narrative it&apos;s there</text><text start="2911.2" dur="3.52">and it&apos;s unavoidable i would even say</text><text start="2913.119" dur="3.361">that i challenge my students these days</text><text start="2914.72" dur="3.28">and say that the one thing a.m will take</text><text

falls</text><text start="3566.799" dur="4.641">works very well</text><text start="3568.72" dur="3.839">with those who hold the nukes</text><text start="3571.44" dur="3.2">because</text><text

start="3591.92" dur="4.159">so i&apos;m curious how you think about that</text><text start="3594.16" dur="3.52">when you think about the transition</text><text start="3596.079" dur="3.121">of power</text><text start="3597.68" dur="3.439">and</text><text start="3599.2" dur="4.08">uh</text><text start="3601.119" dur="4.081">how hard it is to deal with that</text><text start="3603.28" dur="4.64">particular part of it</text><text start="3605.2" dur="4.8">well the old structure stays</text><text start="3607.92" dur="3.6">it doesn&apos;t go away you know food was</text><text

the center of the</text><text start="3614.64" dur="4.32">economy any longer it became a marginal</text><text start="3616.799" dur="4.401">part of the economy and so the same</text><text start="3618.96" dur="4.32">thing here uh the nukes are a perfect</text><text start="3621.2" dur="3.599">case but so far at least they&apos;re not</text><text start="3623.28" dur="3.76">owned by corporate corporations</text><text start="3624.799" dur="4.241">corporations don&apos;t have the nukes yet</text><text start="3627.04" dur="3.92">so they&apos;re stuck with like large

problem</text><text start="3638.079" dur="4.72">right there and and i would say the</text><text start="3640.72" dur="3.52">institutions are still there and what</text><text start="3642.799" dur="3.201">you want to do is you want to keep those</text><text start="3644.24" dur="3.359">institutions that says that okay a few</text><text start="3646.0" dur="3.44">of those institutions still have the</text><text start="3647.599" dur="3.281">problem with the nuclear bomb so it&apos;s</text><text start="3649.44" dur="2.96">locked up for good and then we can see</text><text start="3650.88" dur="2.4">if we use nuclear energy something</text><text start="3652.4" dur="2.56">better</text><text start="3653.28" dur="3.68">uh in in</text><text start="3654.96" dur="4.0">again that means that

like</text><text start="4488.48" dur="2.88">okay there&apos;s a radically complex thing i</text><text start="4490.239" dur="2.561">don&apos;t know what&apos;s going to happen well</text><text start="4491.36" dur="4.08">that&apos;s where you have to do safe to fail</text><text start="4492.8" dur="4.48">probes is there some way to be able to</text><text start="4495.44" dur="3.44">run an

start="4500.4" dur="4.4">then just don&apos;t do the thing yet right</text><text start="4503.28" dur="3.919">um so</text><text start="4504.8" dur="4.48">with a lot of ai and biotech and i think</text><text start="4507.199" dur="3.52">those are the answers and then a lot of</text><text start="4509.28" dur="3.12">it just has to do with processes of</text><text start="4510.719" dur="4.401">recursion</text><text start="4512.4" dur="5.2">so let&apos;s say</text><text start="4515.12" dur="5.039">i want to forecast how my new technology</text><text start="4517.6" dur="3.84">is going to affect people</text><text start="4520.159" dur="2.721">so i think about what are the things</text><text start="4521.44" dur="3.2">this is going to enable that will</text><text start="4522.88" dur="2.88">actually be really desirable as a result</text><text start="4524.64" dur="2.24">what behaviors are those people are</text><text start="4525.76" dur="3.04">going to do as a result how does that</text><text start="4526.88" dur="3.44">affect their minds and psyches does it</text><text start="4528.8" dur="3.919">there&apos;s some super simple principles</text><text start="4530.32" dur="3.68">like if it&apos;s engaging their attention it</text><text start="4532.719" dur="3.041">should make their attention span better</text><text start="4534.0" dur="3.679">if it has an effect</text><text start="4535.76" dur="3.52">just there&apos;s some base reality that it&apos;s</text><text start="4537.679" dur="3.201">engaging with it should enhance the base</text><text start="4539.28" dur="3.68">reality it engages</text><text start="4540.88" dur="3.6">if it has choice architectures that are</text><text start="4542.96" dur="3.36">designed to affect the choices people</text><text start="4544.48" dur="3.44">make i affect their intention it should</text><text start="4546.32" dur="3.76">support their net intentionality and</text><text start="4547.92" dur="3.52">their sovereignty of locus of control</text><text start="4550.08" dur="3.2">like there are some things like that</text><text start="4551.44" dur="2.96">that should be ubiquitous and they&apos;re</text><text start="4553.28" dur="3.36">just not</text><text start="4554.4" dur="4.08">um that could help to even have sense</text><text start="4556.64" dur="2.96">making frameworks to think through oh we</text><text start="4558.48" dur="2.8">couldn&apos;t have guessed it would have done</text><text start="4559.6" dur="3.2">did you even think about it what it</text><text start="4561.28" dur="3.52">would do to attention or intention or</text><text start="4562.8" dur="3.6">polarization or anything like that so we</text><text start="4564.8" dur="3.04">can just do a better job but there will</text><text start="4566.4" dur="2.24">be still be some stuff you don&apos;t predict</text><text start="4567.84" dur="2.24">right</text><text start="4568.64" dur="2.88">so then you run an experiment and then</text><text start="4570.08" dur="2.639">you say oh wow i did the show we didn&apos;t</text><text start="4571.52" dur="3.84">know so now you turn that into the</text><text start="4572.719" dur="4.0">design process then you do a beta</text><text start="4575.36" dur="3.359">release</text><text start="4576.719" dur="3.44">and then you&apos;re watching for a bunch of</text><text start="4578.719" dur="2.641">stuff including some that you don&apos;t</text><text start="4580.159" dur="2.721">know right you&apos;re watching for some</text><text start="4581.36" dur="3.04">stuff but you&apos;re also just saying let&apos;s</text><text start="4582.88" dur="3.04">just watch the people using the people</text><text start="4584.4" dur="3.12">around them and just see if there&apos;s any</text><text start="4585.92" dur="3.36">weird new stuff that happens because</text><text start="4587.52" dur="3.6">that&apos;s how we deal with the unknown</text><text start="4589.28" dur="3.76">unknowns is that we don&apos;t</text><text start="4591.12" dur="4.079">formalize what metrics too closely we</text><text start="4593.04" dur="3.76">just watch for weird stuff right</text><text start="4595.199" dur="3.441">and we didn&apos;t expect that there&apos;d be</text><text start="4596.8" dur="3.84">less time at the family dinner table</text><text start="4598.64" dur="3.519">that&apos;s worth noting so one of the things</text><text start="4600.64" dur="4.0">is if i don&apos;t even know what to look for</text><text start="4602.159" dur="4.08">just do kind of broader spectrum</text><text start="4604.64" dur="3.039">observation</text><text start="4606.239" dur="3.521">and then say okay let&apos;s see if we can</text><text start="4607.679" dur="3.681">find out why do some research on it and</text><text start="4609.76" dur="4.08">then internalize that into the design</text><text start="4611.36" dur="4.4">and fix it again but that means that</text><text start="4613.84" dur="3.44">when you observe the thing</text><text start="4615.76" dur="2.959">and then you come up with a new design</text><text start="4617.28" dur="3.04">whoever comes up with the new design has</text><text start="4618.719" dur="3.841">to have the authority to implement it</text><text start="4620.32" dur="3.68">not just oh sorry that goes against our</text><text start="4622.56" dur="3.36">business model and we have a fiduciary</text><text start="4624.0" dur="3.76">responsibility to maximize profit so you</text><text start="4625.92" dur="3.759">have to create a business that has a</text><text start="4627.76" dur="4.399">collect or a corporation or whatever it</text><text start="4629.679" dur="4.081">is that has a collective intelligence</text><text start="4632.159" dur="3.52">uh</text><text start="4633.76" dur="4.399">i mean excuse me that has a type of</text><text start="4635.679" dur="4.801">intelligence that is

dur="2.72">mistakes were made</text><text start="4647.04" dur="4.08">i think this ties nicely into our idea</text><text start="4648.8" dur="3.52">of the bazaar so</text><text start="4651.12" dur="3.2">there has to be some kind of new</text><text start="4652.32" dur="3.52">container here that works and it&apos;s</text><text start="4654.32" dur="3.68">alternative to the sort of the

the kind of environments</text><text start="4690.48" dur="3.6">moving into right now</text><text start="4693.04" dur="2.48">this is something you said about</text><text start="4694.08" dur="2.88">splitting power and you program that</text><text start="4695.52" dur="4.32">into the ai and this seems</text><text start="4696.96" dur="4.8">extraordinarily problematic because</text><text

ai</text><text start="4707.92" dur="3.12">is not being set up that way and it&apos;s</text><text start="4709.28" dur="3.36">moving really fast</text><text start="4711.04" dur="3.6">so there&apos;s a</text><text start="4712.64" dur="3.92">reality to tend to here</text><text start="4714.64" dur="3.36">the other thing is that</text><text start="4716.56" dur="4.88">making</text><text start="4718.0"

too</text><text start="5581.12" dur="4.4">distant future</text><text start="5582.719" dur="3.841">like you know 50 years out or so that we</text><text start="5585.52" dur="4.56">can see</text><text

new sutra</text><text start="5609.44" dur="3.36">a new story about how we&apos;re going to</text><text start="5611.28" dur="3.76">love our children therefore we want our</text><text start="5612.8" dur="4.08">children to survive us we need a new one</text><text start="5615.04" dur="3.36">so we can&apos;t go back to the old ones and</text><text start="5616.88" dur="4.0">and when it comes to the belief in the</text><text start="5618.4" dur="4.16">afterlife that also ruined ancient egypt</text><text start="5620.88" dur="3.759">that&apos;s why ever since then we sort of</text><text start="5622.56" dur="4.159">suspected that we will not live after</text><text start="5624.639" dur="3.441">we&apos;re dead so</text><text start="5626.719" dur="2.96">the afterlife was a very very</text><text start="5628.08" dur="3.119">destructive thought in that sense when</text><text start="5629.679" dur="2.881">it was taken all the way through the</text><text start="5631.199" dur="3.921">ancient egyptians at least in the first</text><text start="5632.56" dur="4.0">kingdom seriously believed that life</text><text start="5635.12" dur="3.36">after death was more important than life</text><text start="5636.56" dur="4.24">right here and now ever since then but</text><text start="5638.48" dur="5.44">at least we doubted it so uh i think</text><text start="5640.8" dur="4.8">those those i think once the gene is out</text><text start="5643.92" dur="3.92">of the bottle historically in the sense</text><text start="5645.6" dur="4.0">that a certain tantra is now leaked into</text><text start="5647.84" dur="3.68">the sutra and we can no longer pretend</text><text start="5649.6" dur="3.44">it&apos;s not there that&apos;s what i mean we</text><text start="5651.52" dur="2.639">cannot construct the system we believe</text><text start="5653.04" dur="2.96">in the afterlife we believe in</text><text start="5654.159" dur="2.881">reincarnation longer we cannot even</text><text start="5656.0" dur="2.48">believe that we&apos;re going to conquer</text><text start="5657.04" dur="3.28">outer space and live on other planets</text><text start="5658.48" dur="4.08">because way too late to that race ai</text><text start="5660.32" dur="3.6">will certainly beat us to it so a i will</text><text start="5662.56" dur="2.8">take bacteria away and go to other</text><text start="5663.92" dur="4.0">planets and we won&apos;t even be part of the</text><text start="5665.36" dur="3.839">game that&apos;s more likely so we can look</text><text start="5667.92" dur="2.799">into that we can look into what could</text><text start="5669.199" dur="3.04">possibly be the new sutra be what could</text><text start="5670.719" dur="3.281">be the new story we could actually tell</text><text start="5672.239" dur="3.761">each other and agree on and then at</text><text start="5674.0" dur="4.8">least the tantra itself we know it&apos;s</text><text start="5676.0" dur="4.48">around but it&apos;s hidden in containers for</text><text start="5678.8" dur="3.68">the people who can actually absorb it</text><text start="5680.48" dur="4.159">and understand it and thankfully because</text><text start="5682.48" dur="4.159">it&apos;s tantra is so tied to complexity</text><text start="5684.639" dur="3.52">that we can only specialize on certain</text><text start="5686.639" dur="3.441">complexities</text><text start="5688.159" dur="3.201">like you and i honorably do he says yeah</text><text start="5690.08" dur="3.039">we&apos;re supposed to be generalists when</text><text start="5691.36" dur="4.08">nobody can be a generalist any longer</text><text start="5693.119" dur="3.921">that&apos;s impossible we can only understand</text><text start="5695.44" dur="3.52">that that&apos;s impossible therefore we&apos;re</text><text start="5697.04" dur="3.76">more hegelian in the sense that our</text><text start="5698.96" dur="3.759">absolute knowing is not that we know</text><text start="5700.8" dur="3.28">everything it&apos;s that we know the limits</text><text start="5702.719" dur="3.681">of our own knowledge and we thrive</text><text start="5704.08" dur="4.32">within that limit and that&apos;s exactly</text><text start="5706.4" dur="4.48">what we&apos;re promoting very pragmatic</text><text start="5708.4" dur="4.239">ideas constantly we will learn from</text><text start="5710.88" dur="3.12">history like and it&apos;s moving quicker</text><text start="5712.639" dur="3.52">than ever it&apos;s more important than ever</text><text start="5714.0" dur="3.92">to be pragmatic about history and to</text><text start="5716.159" dur="3.441">make due process before we make</text><text
