you a</text><text start="27.86" dur="4.839">conversation with my good friend Daniel</text><text start="29.849" dur="4.951">Martin Berger he is a guy who spends a</text><text start="32.699" dur="5.511">lot of time on global and global</text><text start="34.8" dur="5.73">catastrophic risks something that will</text><text start="38.21" dur="4.69">have you think for a while and I&apos;m sure</text><text start="40.53" dur="4.2">this conversation will give us a new</text><text start="42.9" dur="3.74">perspective on the things that we&apos;re</text><text start="44.73" dur="4.77">dealing with on a day to day basis and</text><text start="46.64" dur="4.45">really as we look forward into the</text><text start="49.5" dur="3.149">future what are the some of the things</text><text start="51.09" dur="4.11">that are important for us to look</text><text start="52.649" dur="3.381">towards Daniel welcome really great to</text><text start="55.2" dur="4.35">have you here today</text><text start="56.03" dur="6.009">thanks for having me let&apos;s just start</text><text start="59.55" dur="5.64">off with where you are you know for all</text><text start="62.039" dur="5.61">of us the pandemic has caused some some</text><text start="65.19" dur="4.02">dramatic and large shifts in life but I</text><text start="67.649" dur="3.75">find that that extra just that&apos;s</text><text start="69.21" dur="4.049">different for everybody in their worlds</text><text start="71.399" dur="3.72">how is your world been altered or</text><text start="73.259" dur="3.961">changed are there things that have</text><text start="75.119" dur="5.071">changed the levels of importance and</text><text start="77.22" dur="7.319">urgency for you yeah what&apos;s what&apos;s going</text><text start="80.19" dur="7.56">on over there for you it&apos;s interesting</text><text start="84.539" dur="7.56">having been communicating with people</text><text start="87.75" dur="7.259">about the risk of large-scale global</text><text start="92.099" dur="5.341">catastrophes for a long time versus</text><text start="95.009" dur="5.31">being in one that is happening in terms</text><text start="97.44" dur="8.34">of people&apos;s general ability to feel the</text><text start="100.319" dur="8.521">reality of it and at this point the</text><text start="105.78" dur="5.58">actual risk from the virus itself is</text><text start="108.84" dur="5.55">relatively small compared to the risk of</text><text start="111.36" dur="6.959">our responses to the virus so when we&apos;re</text><text start="114.39" dur="5.97">talking about things like shutting down</text><text start="118.319" dur="3.481">travel which makes sense if there&apos;s a</text><text start="120.36" dur="3.78">viral transmission thing but in ways</text><text start="121.8" dur="5.909">that don&apos;t protect food supply issues</text><text start="124.14" dur="5.31">and then damaging the pesticides getting</text><text start="127.709" dur="4.761">to northern Africa and parts the Middle</text><text start="129.45" dur="5.25">East so locusts take over the food and</text><text start="132.47" dur="3.79">restaurants not being able to be the</text><text start="134.7" dur="3.6">major importers of food and not having</text><text start="136.26" dur="4.35">other supply chain possibilities and so</text><text start="138.3" dur="5.25">you know damaging the food supply for</text><text start="140.61" dur="5.01">two billion people is a bigger deal then</text><text start="143.55" dur="5.18">the viruses itself in terms of actual</text><text start="145.62" dur="6.08">risk to life so is the in</text><text start="148.73" dur="8.17">authoritarian ISM of states breakdown of</text><text start="151.7" dur="7.48">international alliances increase in</text><text start="156.9" dur="5.01">state-based and corporate based</text><text start="159.18" dur="4.98">surveillance capabilities escalation</text><text start="161.91" dur="4.77">pathways towards violence so you know</text><text start="164.16" dur="5.25">we&apos;re in a the situation was like Co vid</text><text start="166.68" dur="6.54">was just a big enough thing that it was</text><text start="169.41" dur="5.28">able to set off a cascade of things that</text><text start="173.22" dur="3.39">were all that would have been set off by</text><text start="174.69" dur="7.4">something right because there was all</text><text start="176.61" dur="5.48">these systemic fragilities and so now</text><text start="182.39" dur="5.7">people&apos;s relationship to the topic of</text><text start="184.86" dur="6.09">global catastrophic risk is different</text><text start="188.09" dur="4.33">yeah and and you know how does that does</text><text start="190.95" dur="2.52">that alter your work at all you&apos;ve just</text><text start="192.42" dur="2.97">been working on the things you&apos;ve been</text><text start="193.47" dur="4.049">working on is there any change of focus</text><text start="195.39" dur="7.29">or change of urgency or anything for you</text><text start="197.519" dur="8.931">right now yeah I mean there&apos;s there are</text><text start="202.68" dur="6.119">a lot more people who are more ready to</text><text start="206.45" dur="3.31">take the conversation seriously so</text><text start="208.799" dur="3.84">there&apos;s a lot of things that have</text><text start="209.76" dur="4.71">accelerated for us there&apos;s also a lot of</text><text start="212.639" dur="3.361">things that have to happen on relatively</text><text start="214.47" dur="4.47">quick timelines where they reach points</text><text start="216.0" dur="5.97">of irreversibility so there&apos;s a lot in</text><text start="218.94" dur="4.94">my focus and work that has happened</text><text start="221.97" dur="3.989">because of that</text><text start="223.88" dur="5.35">responding to kovat is intelligible</text><text start="225.959" dur="6.36">right and I&apos;m way more than responding</text><text start="229.23" dur="4.89">to global ecological crisis or AI risk</text><text start="232.319" dur="3.57">or anything else was its intelligible in</text><text start="234.12" dur="4.08">a different way and eminence right and</text><text start="235.889" dur="4.171">timely and having government funds</text><text start="238.2" dur="4.98">allocated to it and all the new cycles</text><text start="240.06" dur="4.47">and things like that and so insofar as</text><text start="243.18" dur="3.179">responding to Kove it also means</text><text start="244.53" dur="5.94">responding to the second-order effects</text><text start="246.359" dur="5.671">associated with Co vid there are a lot</text><text start="250.47" dur="6.35">more institutional conversations</text><text start="252.03" dur="6.9">happening that are at least kind of</text><text start="256.82" dur="8.62">thinking about some things a little bit</text><text start="258.93" dur="9.419">better far from adequate so at the same</text><text start="265.44" dur="5.58">time I would say that the general</text><text start="268.349" dur="6.211">information ecology has gotten much much</text><text start="271.02" dur="7.86">worse I mean it was already completely</text><text start="274.56" dur="6.35">fragmented but and I would say one of</text><text start="278.88" dur="4.47">the things it is</text><text start="280.91" dur="4.45">most concerning to me and we&apos;re doing</text><text start="283.35" dur="5.01">some work towards trying to help with</text><text start="285.36" dur="4.83">this is the mismatch between the actual</text><text start="288.36" dur="3.66">complexity of the problems facing the</text><text start="290.19" dur="4.97">world and the complexity that most</text><text start="292.02" dur="6.66">people can actually process on their own</text><text start="295.16" dur="6.84">so most people want relatively simple</text><text start="298.68" dur="5.61">narratives and so that you see this in</text><text start="302.0" dur="3.91">bipartisan politics is that they want</text><text start="304.29" dur="3.629">some kind of who the good guys are and</text><text start="305.91" dur="5.72">who the bad guys are and they either</text><text start="307.919" dur="7.591">want that the General Authorities are</text><text start="311.63" dur="5.53">generally good and the virus is really</text><text start="315.51" dur="3.96">serious and we should kind of listen to</text><text start="317.16" dur="4.44">the authorities and stay home and or the</text><text start="319.47" dur="4.259">General Authorities are probably bad and</text><text start="321.6" dur="3.81">this is a attempt to take all our civil</text><text start="323.729" dur="4.831">liberties away and the virus is probably</text><text start="325.41" dur="6.0">exaggerated and the nuance of like well</text><text start="328.56" dur="4.29">the virus is serious and there are real</text><text start="331.41" dur="2.91">serious responses that need to happen</text><text start="332.85" dur="3.9">there&apos;s also a lot of predatory</text><text start="334.32" dur="4.319">opportunism that various power actors</text><text start="336.75" dur="3.33">have there&apos;s a distribution of the</text><text start="338.639" dur="5.84">goodness and badness of authorities</text><text start="340.08" dur="6.809">towards different goals the the actual</text><text start="344.479" dur="4.301">reality of it is just much more</text><text start="346.889" dur="5.161">nuanced and complex and not a simple</text><text start="348.78" dur="9.63">narrative arc and then when it comes to</text><text start="352.05" dur="8.22">the science of like so how what is the</text><text start="358.41" dur="3.66">actual case fatality rate is this just a</text><text start="360.27" dur="3.63">flu is it more serious than the flu the</text><text start="362.07" dur="5.219">epidemiology is not totally trivial</text><text start="363.9" dur="4.829">right to actually understand wait are we</text><text start="367.289" dur="3.271">doing background tests on non</text><text start="368.729" dur="3.451">symptomatic people and is an</text><text start="370.56" dur="3.51">immunological assay of the right kind</text><text start="372.18" dur="4.109">and does it what are the false positives</text><text start="374.07" dur="4.129">and negatives and and then people will</text><text start="376.289" dur="4.35">start talking about the association of</text><text start="378.199" dur="4.811">5-g or maybe it&apos;s not really a virus</text><text start="380.639" dur="4.56">it&apos;s an exosome well most people don&apos;t</text><text start="383.01" dur="5.79">have enough molecular biology to be able</text><text start="385.199" dur="5.521">to answer that and so then whoever it is</text><text start="388.8" dur="4.799">it starts trending on Facebook because</text><text start="390.72" dur="4.319">it hits some emotional tropes ends up</text><text start="393.599" dur="3.991">being what gets shared and echo-chamber</text><text start="395.039" dur="4.051">effective and it&apos;s emotional and it&apos;s</text><text start="397.59" dur="3.389">consequential and people are actually</text><text start="399.09" dur="4.62">spending more time trying to sense make</text><text start="400.979" dur="4.741">while coming up with worse answers and</text><text start="403.71" dur="3.329">then also wanting to act on AI wanting</text><text start="405.72" dur="3.569">to take their guns and go out in front</text><text start="407.039" dur="4.231">of the protest building or wanting to</text><text start="409.289" dur="3.511">get Facebook and Google to shut down all</text><text start="411.27" dur="2.52">news of those types of those people</text><text start="412.8" dur="3.06">don&apos;t do that</text><text start="413.79" dur="3.51">which are all basically escalations</text><text start="415.86" dur="5.19">towards violence of different types all</text><text start="417.3" dur="6.12">based on wrong information and theirs is</text><text start="421.05" dur="4.11">their I mean this is the economy the</text><text start="423.42" dur="3.93">information ecology so damaged that</text><text start="425.16" dur="6.11">there&apos;s little or no hope of actually</text><text start="427.35" dur="3.92">getting good information right now I</text><text start="435.68" dur="8.11">think that what it takes to get</text><text start="441.05" dur="5.11">actionable intelligence to get enough</text><text start="443.79" dur="4.71">information that your action on it will</text><text start="446.16" dur="5.04">actually be appropriate action is a</text><text start="448.5" dur="5.73">higher level of capacity and discipline</text><text start="451.2" dur="6.69">than most people have yeah and that&apos;s</text><text start="454.23" dur="5.19">the tricky thing yeah and we have to</text><text start="457.89" dur="3.03">have trust somewhere then we&apos;re gonna</text><text start="459.42" dur="3.39">have to trust we&apos;re gonna have to if we</text><text start="460.92" dur="4.86">can&apos;t do it for ourselves and either we</text><text start="462.81" dur="4.74">have go with an understanding that we&apos;re</text><text start="465.78" dur="5.03">not going to ever have good sense making</text><text start="467.55" dur="5.67">or we have to trust somebody&apos;s analysis</text><text start="470.81" dur="5.62">we have to trust our own discernment</text><text start="473.22" dur="4.89">capacity to know who we trust right like</text><text start="476.43" dur="3.99">this is true in personal relationships</text><text start="478.11" dur="4.83">if you trusted somebody and got hurt</text><text start="480.42" dur="4.68">because they embezzled from you or</text><text start="482.94" dur="4.26">cheated on you or whatever it is there&apos;s</text><text start="485.1" dur="3.69">a deeper question around why did you</text><text start="487.2" dur="3.06">trust them if they were not actually</text><text start="488.79" dur="3.48">trustworthy which is trusting your own</text><text start="490.26" dur="3.54">capacity for discernment and their it</text><text start="492.27" dur="3.24">might be trustworthiness of intent but</text><text start="493.8" dur="2.49">also trustworthiness of capacity and</text><text start="495.51" dur="3.96">sense-making</text><text start="496.29" dur="5.61">so to the degree that I want to</text><text start="499.47" dur="4.5">cognitively offload some of the</text><text start="501.9" dur="5.49">complexity to someone else I&apos;m still</text><text start="503.97" dur="5.25">ultimately responsible for what I</text><text start="507.39" dur="3.09">believe in the consequence of my actions</text><text start="509.22" dur="5.129">based on those beliefs if they&apos;re wrong</text><text start="510.48" dur="6.09">or right and so what level of</text><text start="514.349" dur="5.13">understanding do I need when experts in</text><text start="516.57" dur="8.16">the field disagree to even decide where</text><text start="519.479" dur="7.711">I trust well and I think another</text><text start="524.73" dur="7.23">question to be asking around that is how</text><text start="527.19" dur="8.3">can we discern a person&apos;s ability to</text><text start="531.96" dur="6.57">articulate the complexity as an absolute</text><text start="535.49" dur="4.66">truth or a part of our truth that we can</text><text start="538.53" dur="3.87">put into our baskets then later</text><text start="540.15" dur="6.24">synthesized and not blindly agree</text><text start="542.4" dur="5.19">because of the poetic feelings I believe</text><text start="546.39" dur="3.86">that the emotional pole</text><text start="547.59" dur="5.25">that it allows me to feel and sometimes</text><text start="550.25" dur="5.38">you know I I have to admit that and</text><text start="552.84" dur="4.5">these conscious quote-unquote conscious</text><text start="555.63" dur="4.32">conversations around what&apos;s happening to</text><text start="557.34" dur="5.25">these little pandemics people want to be</text><text start="559.95" dur="5.21">agreeable with someone who has that</text><text start="562.59" dur="5.88">ability to articulate complexities</text><text start="565.16" dur="5.92">mostly for the sake of because it allows</text><text start="568.47" dur="4.14">them to have some sort of validity and</text><text start="571.08" dur="3.96">making them feel smarter or more</text><text start="572.61" dur="4.29">included in that narrative which is</text><text start="575.04" dur="4.68">really not the reason why you would want</text><text start="576.9" dur="5.25">to agree to someone&apos;s material in the</text><text start="579.72" dur="5.67">first place and then what happens is we</text><text start="582.15" dur="5.67">get a lot of blind knowledge nodding and</text><text start="585.39" dur="4.14">agreeably to what&apos;s happening for</text><text start="587.82" dur="4.38">somebody and then that becomes the</text><text start="589.53" dur="4.56">general narrative that leads into maybe</text><text start="592.2" dur="4.56">sometimes a misled group of people</text><text start="594.09" dur="5.34">taking unreasonable action in the world</text><text start="596.76" dur="5.4">and you know we have enough of those</text><text start="599.43" dur="4.11">clusters going around and then we have</text><text start="602.16" dur="5.55">everybody going in every which way</text><text start="603.54" dur="6.33">direction with a spoon fed and self</text><text start="607.71" dur="7.07">imposed righteousness attached to it in</text><text start="609.87" dur="9.66">some way and so I&apos;m curious how can we</text><text start="614.78" dur="8.41">build our capacities better to bring a</text><text start="619.53" dur="8.84">higher level of balance into what it is</text><text start="623.19" dur="9.36">that we can collectively do and pose the</text><text start="628.37" dur="6.51">the question to even have a question</text><text start="632.55" dur="4.95">about the information that we&apos;re having</text><text start="634.88" dur="7.24">as we continue this this journey</text><text start="637.5" dur="7.92">together yeah you as to how question and</text><text start="642.12" dur="5.46">there&apos;s some very basic things that will</text><text start="645.42" dur="5.43">create some traction it&apos;s not the whole</text><text start="647.58" dur="4.77">answer but basic things first I&apos;ll say</text><text start="650.85" dur="8.04">something about agreeableness since you</text><text start="652.35" dur="10.43">mentioned that that the spirit of good</text><text start="658.89" dur="9.18">sense making of good epistemology is the</text><text start="662.78" dur="7.87">earnest desire to know and so bias of</text><text start="668.07" dur="6.8">any kind is the enemy of science or</text><text start="670.65" dur="6.48">epistemology or or sense making right</text><text start="674.87" dur="4.92">agreeableness and disagreeableness are</text><text start="677.13" dur="2.66">both biases</text><text start="680.18" dur="4.02">and their relational biases to relate in</text><text start="682.399" dur="3.091">a particular way with the person but</text><text start="684.2" dur="4.05">that also means relating with their</text><text start="685.49" dur="5.19">information in a way that predisposes a</text><text start="688.25" dur="4.1">particular kind of relationship to that</text><text start="690.68" dur="3.69">information</text><text start="692.35" dur="4.87">independent of what the actual truth of</text><text start="694.37" dur="4.62">it is so there are people who like to be</text><text start="697.22" dur="3.63">disagreeable who will just figure out</text><text start="698.99" dur="4.71">how to devil&apos;s advocate you no matter</text><text start="700.85" dur="5.549">what that&apos;s not that useful right</text><text start="703.7" dur="6.18">because that&apos;s a lot of waste of time</text><text start="706.399" dur="5.461">and energy if what you&apos;re saying is</text><text start="709.88" dur="3.18">actually true and they should and if</text><text start="711.86" dur="3.63">they didn&apos;t have that bias they&apos;d be</text><text start="713.06" dur="7.22">like oh yeah that actually makes sense</text><text start="715.49" dur="6.92">and agree ability similarly leads to</text><text start="720.28" dur="4.63">[Music]</text><text start="722.41" dur="8.08">echo chambers and people not actually</text><text start="724.91" dur="7.35">thinking and so I really like for people</text><text start="730.49" dur="5.31">to not have either of those biases as</text><text start="732.26" dur="7.26">much as possible and to separate their</text><text start="735.8" dur="5.58">desire to have effective relationships</text><text start="739.52" dur="3.27">with people and their desire to think a</text><text start="741.38" dur="3.81">particular thing about a particular</text><text start="742.79" dur="5.79">topic so I can disagree with you well</text><text start="745.19" dur="5.31">totally respecting you and having a good</text><text start="748.58" dur="5.21">relationship and if

dur="6.311">narratives that synthesize knowing all</text><text start="1067.299" dur="5.281">of those things together now if I say I</text><text start="1071.08" dur="5.189">don&apos;t know it could be

so much that I&apos;m not</text><text start="1083.72" dur="5.97">willing to have false confidence that</text><text start="1086.33" dur="5.16">biases me because once I start to have I</text><text

dur="4.05">really care that&apos;s the worst thing I</text><text start="1100.73" dur="2.819">could do I ruined my ability to be</text><text start="1102.2" dur="3.54">connected to reality at that

defining what our near-term</text><text start="1256.73" dur="5.34">future might look like six 12 18 months</text><text start="1260.06" dur="4.92">and then really what are some of the</text><text

the whole conversation</text><text start="1281.51" dur="8.61">around return to normal a lot of things</text><text start="1288.08" dur="6.24">have been really profoundly damaged</text><text

businesses can come in</text><text start="1323.45" dur="5.94">who have war chests and start to buy up</text><text start="1325.79" dur="6.63">that space so that represents you know</text><text

on what was</text><text start="1348.54" dur="7.71">already an unsustainable economic</text><text start="1351.66" dur="7.14">inequality we see that the GDP went down</text><text start="1356.25"

dur="6.06">from that and then we start to look at</text><text start="1377.7" dur="5.25">the damage that&apos;s happened to the EU as</text><text start="1379.98" dur="5.97">a system and what that means

the</text><text start="1403.77" dur="7.49">virus but by all of the second third</text><text start="1406.2" dur="7.979">order effects so if we want to return to</text><text start="1411.26" dur="4.57">a not really damaged world we have to</text><text start="1414.179" dur="3.331">fix not just the virus but fix those</text><text start="1415.83" dur="4.59">other things and what it takes to fix</text><text start="1417.51" dur="4.38">those would require a level of people</text><text start="1420.42" dur="3.21">understanding them so would require</text><text start="1421.89" dur="3.6">better sense making and way the</text><text start="1423.63" dur="4.95">better coordination ie governance at</text><text start="1425.49" dur="4.86">both you know nation-state levels</text><text start="1428.58" dur="5.13">between public and private sector and</text><text start="1430.35" dur="5.34">internationally and if we got that we</text><text start="1433.71" dur="4.23">could make it much much much better</text><text start="1435.69" dur="4.25">right because those are those would be</text><text start="1437.94" dur="4.71">significant changes to the core</text><text start="1439.94" dur="6.97">civilization systems so we will come out</text><text start="1442.65" dur="5.94">of this different and it will either be</text><text start="1446.91" dur="3.81">meaningfully worse or meaningfully</text><text start="1448.59" dur="4.29">better in terms of the overall health</text><text start="1450.72" dur="7.2">and integrity of the global Commons and</text><text start="1452.88" dur="7.59">systems and then looking out beyond that</text><text start="1457.92" dur="4.68">time or looking at is that is this this</text><text start="1460.47" dur="5.31">thing that I mean I just want my really</text><text start="1462.6" dur="6.0">clear flat simple question is this is</text><text start="1465.78" dur="5.64">this an opportunity for systems upgrades</text><text start="1468.6"

start="1478.02" dur="5.47">you mentioned when we were talking</text><text start="1479.92" dur="5.49">earlier about you know the frame that</text><text start="1483.49" dur="6.24">some people are holding of the kind of</text><text start="1485.41" dur="5.85">pause that this is right well the most</text><text start="1489.73" dur="3.0">powerful actors in the world not only</text><text start="1491.26" dur="7.56">don&apos;t have a pause they&apos;ve increased</text><text start="1492.73" dur="9.27">their activity many fold right the</text><text start="1498.82" dur="5.25">Kremlin and the CCP and the DNC and the</text><text start="1502.0" dur="4.35">GOP they&apos;re not paused right they&apos;re</text><text start="1504.07" dur="4.29"> power grabbing like crazy and</text><text start="1506.35" dur="5.76">trying to advance their agendas and</text><text start="1508.36" dur="6.78">doing so with really asymmetric</text><text start="1512.11" dur="5.04">information capabilities

dur="3.75">feels like it&apos;s a great pause that also</text><text start="1522.97" dur="8.82">says where you are in the food chain</text><text start="1524.98" dur="10.35">kind of what&apos;s influencing the world so</text><text start="1531.79" dur="6.06">I think there&apos;s a lot of things that are</text><text start="1535.33" dur="4.83">being advanced that and when you mention</text><text start="1537.85" dur="5.1">opportunity that some people are seeing</text><text start="1540.16" dur="4.86">as opportunities to advance their</text><text start="1542.95"

who for</text><text start="1550.69" dur="4.41">whatever reason really believe in or</text><text start="1553.09" dur="5.16">like or are aesthetically attracted to</text><text start="1555.1" dur="6.3">authoritarian type structures so when</text><text start="1558.25" dur="4.62">you see you know the President of the</text><text start="1561.4" dur="3.54">Philippines when it was time for</text><text start="1562.87" dur="3.21">quarantine just so happily taken say yes</text><text start="1564.94" dur="3.3">shoot people who are violating</text><text start="1566.08" dur="3.9">quarantine it just appeals to a</text><text start="1568.24" dur="5.01">sensibility like his to take</text><text start="1569.98" dur="6.84">authoritarian measures of those kinds so</text><text start="1573.25" dur="5.49">and in more technologically advanced</text><text start="1576.82" dur="4.83">countries those same people are looking</text><text start="1578.74" dur="5.52">at implementing massive thermal scans</text><text start="1581.65" dur="5.43">and AI drone type capabilities and</text><text start="1584.26" dur="4.77">surveillance capabilities and how much</text><text start="1587.08" dur="5.97">is just their own personal economic</text><text start="1589.03" dur="7.14">incentive associated being the major you</text><text start="1593.05" dur="5.28">know funders or or

dur="5.49">ideological agendas so there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="1604.21" dur="4.32">people pursuing opportunities but that</text><text start="1606.16" dur="4.08">are not the opportunities that we would</text><text start="1608.53" dur="2.02">say create the highest quality of life</text><text start="1610.24" dur="2.8">for</text><text start="1610.55" dur="7.62">everybody in a good in in what I would</text><text start="1613.04" dur="6.66">call a good sense making frame now there</text><text start="1618.17" dur="4.14">are some people doing things that are</text><text start="1619.7" dur="4.86">authentically really interesting right</text><text start="1622.31" dur="4.26">now and it could move things in the</text><text start="1624.56" dur="3.3">right direction but they are not they</text><text start="1626.57" dur="5.7">don&apos;t have as much resource they aren&apos;t</text><text start="1627.86" dur="6.69">as well coordinated so as the food</text><text start="1632.27" dur="5.15">supply chains break this is a real</text><text start="1634.55" dur="4.89">interesting one right so we see the</text><text start="1637.42" dur="5.44">coaling which is this very funny</text><text start="1639.44" dur="5.9">sanitized term right : of all the</text><text start="1642.86" dur="6.84">chickens and the pigs and like that and</text><text start="1645.34" dur="5.4">burying the potatoes and pouring down</text><text start="1649.7" dur="3.45">the drain all the milk</text><text start="1650.74" dur="4.03">just as many people exist that need to</text><text start="1653.15" dur="3.39">eat like what the why are we</text><text start="1654.77" dur="4.2">destroying all the supply when there&apos;s</text><text start="1656.54" dur="4.23">just as much aggregate demand it&apos;s just</text><text start="1658.97" dur="4.29">the demand used to go to McDonald&apos;s</text><text start="1660.77" dur="3.75">right it used to go to a few major</text><text start="1663.26" dur="2.94">distribution centers when those</text><text start="1664.52" dur="3.33">distribution centers can&apos;t get it and</text><text start="1666.2" dur="4.59">you&apos;re operating on relatively tighter</text><text start="1667.85" dur="5.43">margins then the supply side is like</text><text start="1670.79" dur="3.99">well we can&apos;t keep paying for these pigs</text><text start="1673.28" dur="3.78">or these chickens if we can&apos;t sell stuff</text><text start="1674.78" dur="3.42">so it&apos;s actually cheaper for us to just</text><text start="1677.06" dur="3.24">kill them and destroy them but then all</text><text start="1678.2" dur="4.5">the people still need food and like</text><text start="1680.3" dur="4.26">that&apos;s just a supply chain issue right</text><text start="1682.7" dur="3.33">that&apos;s a supply intelligence so just can</text><text start="1684.56" dur="5.97">we get the supply to the demand through</text><text start="1686.03" dur="6.66">a different route well the longer the</text><text start="1690.53" dur="4.59">route is the easy the more steps there</text><text start="1692.69" dur="5.94">are they can damage it so the movement</text><text start="1695.12" dur="5.25">to say well we should actually have food</text><text start="1698.63" dur="4.71">supply be more distributed and more</text><text start="1700.37" dur="4.68">local oh and by the way if it&apos;s more</text><text start="1703.34" dur="3.18">local there won&apos;t be factory farms</text><text start="1705.05" dur="2.4">because nobody wants to be around a</text><text start="1706.52" dur="3.06">factory farm because they&apos;re</text><text start="1707.45" dur="3.51">horrible and so you have to put them</text><text start="1709.58" dur="3.39">somewhere far away and then of course</text><text start="1710.96" dur="4.5">that means it&apos;s centralized shipping to</text><text start="1712.97" dur="4.86">everywhere else so does that mean that</text><text start="1715.46" dur="4.2">we can get better Ethical Treatment of</text><text start="1717.83" dur="3.41">Animals better environmental care better</text><text start="1719.66" dur="4.08">health for the people and better</text><text start="1721.24" dur="4.75">robustness and resiliency of the food</text><text start="1723.74" dur="3.78">supply grid simultaneously yeah totally</text><text start="1725.99" dur="3.99">that should happen right and there&apos;s</text><text start="1727.52" dur="4.19">some totally inadequate but some</text><text start="1729.98" dur="4.98">movements happening in that direction</text><text start="1731.71" dur="5.77">this is an interesting one because this</text><text start="1734.96" dur="4.35">is something where like anyone can</text><text start="1737.48" dur="4.02">engage to some degree right you can just</text><text start="1739.31" dur="3.48">say I&apos;m gonna do a home garden right and</text><text start="1741.5" dur="2.88">that&apos;s engaging to some degree or I&apos;m</text><text start="1742.79" dur="3.24">gonna help a community garden in our air</text><text start="1744.38" dur="3.9">I&apos;m gonna help our small towns start</text><text start="1746.03" dur="4.59">working on local resilience like can we</text><text start="1748.28" dur="4.26">get a couple people to start engaging in</text><text start="1750.62" dur="4.53">growing stuff for this region as opposed</text><text start="1752.54" dur="6.09">to everything being based on import and</text><text start="1755.15" dur="5.73">export and so there&apos;s like there&apos;s real</text><text start="1758.63" dur="4.35">local you can do to engage in that</text><text start="1760.88" dur="4.02">at the same time there&apos;s stuff that some</text><text start="1762.98" dur="3.87">people need to do to sake who have real</text><text start="1764.9" dur="5.33">supply chain capabilities and enough</text><text start="1766.85" dur="5.82">money to front the costs to be able to</text><text start="1770.23" dur="3.25">you know meet the supply and demand</text><text start="1772.67" dur="6.09">where it&apos;s at</text><text start="1773.48" dur="6.45">so for every one of the places where it</text><text start="1778.76" dur="3.81">could go really bad there&apos;s an</text><text start="1779.93" dur="5.37">opportunity right the kids not being at</text><text start="1782.57" dur="4.68">school and the combination of them</text><text start="1785.3" dur="4.38">getting way more screen addiction as a</text><text start="1787.25" dur="6.75">result of more domestic abuse happening</text><text start="1789.68" dur="6.42">as a result of damage happening in their</text><text start="1794.0" dur="3.96">social development like that&apos;s pretty</text><text start="1796.1" dur="3.69">bad actually when you think about what</text><text start="1797.96" dur="5.91">that means for a generation is pretty</text><text start="1799.79" dur="5.91">bad but the opportunity to say</text><text start="1803.87" dur="3.09">let&apos;s we have to fix that and while</text><text start="1805.7" dur="3.39">we&apos;re fixing it let&apos;s just kind of</text><text start="1806.96" dur="4.11">rethink education from scratch and how</text><text start="1809.09" dur="3.99">do we if we were gonna be delivering</text><text start="1811.07" dur="3.75">education not to the legacy system how</text><text start="1813.08" dur="6.33">would we do it that&apos;s a pretty awesome</text><text start="1814.82" dur="6.54">opportunity a bunch of jobs go away and</text><text start="1819.41" dur="3.42">we realize wow there was a bunch of jobs</text><text start="1821.36" dur="3.09">that were really just jobs</text><text start="1822.83" dur="5.25">right like there were just make work</text><text start="1824.45" dur="4.71">kind of jobs well if those people can&apos;t</text><text start="1828.08" dur="3.87">feed their families they don&apos;t care</text><text start="1829.16" dur="4.98">because like it was meeting some need</text><text start="1831.95" dur="6.84">but we also get to say can we start to</text><text start="1834.14" dur="6.63">rethink our like what productive and</text><text start="1838.79" dur="4.92">meaningful work and how people get there</text><text start="1840.77" dur="4.65">you know finances Medora so I&apos;d say if</text><text start="1843.71" dur="3.72">you go across the sector&apos;s just take</text><text start="1845.42" dur="5.37">health care take you know pick every</text><text start="1847.43" dur="4.95">sector and say what are the risks in</text><text start="1850.79" dur="4.74">this space and what harm has already</text><text start="1852.38" dur="5.1">happened and associated with that to</text><text start="1855.53" dur="3.45">solve the harm to prevent the risks and</text><text start="1857.48" dur="2.73">to make it better what would better look</text><text start="1858.98" dur="5.06">like what are the opportunities in that</text><text start="1860.21" dur="7.74">space that&apos;s a valuable thought process</text><text start="1864.04" dur="5.86">great so let&apos;s think about you know</text><text start="1867.95" dur="3.96">somebody might be watching this this</text><text start="1869.9" dur="4.56">video right now Dan Yellin and you know</text><text start="1871.91" dur="6.3">that there may be theirs they&apos;ve they&apos;ve</text><text start="1874.46" dur="5.76">kind of got some of the harm in for work</text><text start="1878.21" dur="4.59">has done to our information ecology and</text><text start="1880.22" dur="4.92">they have a sense that I think that it&apos;s</text><text start="1882.8" dur="4.41">difficult to make sense but they have a</text><text start="1885.14" dur="5.19">longing or like just a general feeling</text><text start="1887.21" dur="5.13">if they want to be of service you know</text><text start="1890.33" dur="4.14">right now no how did that how do they</text><text start="1892.34" dur="3.51">get started I mean like like and we&apos;ve</text><text start="1894.47" dur="2.76">talked we&apos;re talking you know through</text><text start="1895.85" dur="3.09">the years a lot about consciousness what</text><text start="1897.23" dur="3.81">we mean by raising consciousness but</text><text start="1898.94" dur="4.65">they&apos;re like what are what are some of</text><text start="1901.04" dur="4.32">those things right now this is a moment</text><text start="1903.59" dur="5.76">where we get to retake we get to take</text><text start="1905.36" dur="6.54">stock where our lives and think about</text><text start="1909.35" dur="6.12">how we might reconstitute ourselves</text><text start="1911.9" dur="4.95">differently than than before you know</text><text start="1915.47" dur="4.11">what are some of the things that that we</text><text start="1916.85" dur="4.05">can look to what are the steps that we</text><text start="1919.58" dur="4.38">might be able to take to be able to</text><text start="1920.9" dur="5.25">participate meaningfully in a world that</text><text start="1923.96" dur="12.29">works better or ultimately a thriving</text><text start="1926.15" dur="14.01">room and pause because I know I know</text><text start="1936.25" dur="7.36">statistically that whatever I say even</text><text start="1940.16" dur="5.04">if it is inspiring won&apos;t make it through</text><text start="1943.61" dur="3.39">people&apos;s memory after they scroll</text><text start="1945.2" dur="4.73">Facebook or Instagram the first time or</text><text start="1947.0" dur="8.07">get on a phone called it&apos;s stressful and</text><text start="1949.93" dur="8.01">so inspiration that isn&apos;t gonna last</text><text start="1955.07" dur="6.45">through a bunch of hyper normal stimuli</text><text start="1957.94" dur="7.09">not worth so much so if I wanted to say</text><text start="1961.52" dur="4.89">what could people do and they would feel</text><text start="1965.03" dur="2.64">inspired after this but then they would</text><text start="1966.41" dur="3.51">lose it the first thing I want to say is</text><text start="1967.67" dur="3.99">well and what could you do to not lose</text><text start="1969.92" dur="3.48">it what could you do to stay engaged in</text><text start="1971.66" dur="3.69">a conversation that would keep orienting</text><text start="1973.4" dur="4.08">you in the right direction so that&apos;s</text><text start="1975.35" dur="4.23">kind of meta to the specific thing to do</text><text start="1977.48" dur="8.55">but it&apos;s how to be engaged in a way that</text><text start="1979.58" dur="8.01">will keep engaging you so I would say if</text><text start="1986.03" dur="7.02">I had to pick one thing that would have</text><text start="1987.59" dur="7.92">people do is figure out how to engage</text><text start="1993.05" dur="4.02">more often with people and content that</text><text start="1995.51" dur="3.06">are actively doing things that you find</text><text start="1997.07" dur="5.1">inspiring that will orient your</text><text start="1998.57" dur="6.12">attention continuously that way because</text><text start="2002.17" dur="4.05">whether it&apos;s Facebook or your family or</text><text start="2004.69" dur="2.58">your job or your kids or whatever it is</text><text start="2006.22" dur="2.46">there will be a lot of things that are</text><text start="2007.27" dur="3.84">orienting you in other directions and</text><text start="2008.68" dur="2.81">being oriented to what is it that I feel</text><text start="2011.11" dur="2.48">really</text><text start="2011.49" dur="4.59">lately called you know which very much</text><text start="2013.59" dur="4.23">might be your kids but from a different</text><text start="2016.08" dur="5.19">frame right what is that I feel most</text><text start="2017.82" dur="5.43">called to engage in I would say figure</text><text start="2021.27" dur="4.62">out how to engage and this is like this</text><text start="2023.25" dur="5.61">is the purpose of church right or the</text><text start="2025.89" dur="5.12">Sangha was that you kind of need to keep</text><text start="2028.86" dur="4.47">coming back and having some regular</text><text start="2031.01" dur="3.52">community reminder because humans are</text><text start="2033.33" dur="2.7">social primates and the thing that</text><text start="2034.53" dur="5.67">affects us more than anything is who</text><text start="2036.03" dur="5.82">were around and I know that&apos;s why you</text><text start="2040.2" dur="3.27">know in addition to this festival you&apos;re</text><text start="2041.85" dur="2.94">working on putting out

thing I would say I can</text><text start="2049.95" dur="8.479">now say some more specific things if you</text><text start="2053.429" dur="9.081">want yeah yeah what do you see</text><text start="2058.429" dur="6.791">so somebody listening to this is a</text><text start="2062.51" dur="4.45">online marketer and somebody&apos;s an</text><text start="2065.22" dur="3.57">accountant and someone&apos;s a construction</text><text start="2066.96" dur="3.36">worker and somebody is a farmer and</text><text start="2068.79" dur="3.66">somebody&apos;s a trust fund kid and</text><text

there is definitely</text><text start="2105.0" dur="4.17">useful you can do if you feel</text><text start="2106.47" dur="4.59">called to do useful things and if you</text><text start="2109.17"

is it</text><text start="2918.02" dur="3.51">that has us have the capacity to do that</text><text start="2919.94" dur="5.01">or is it just allowing the</text><text start="2921.53"

better than I can</text><text start="2951.74" dur="2.97">I mean even at the scale of the</text><text start="2953.42" dur="4.29">cross-section of who we&apos;re talking about</text><text start="2954.71" dur="4.89">right that&apos;s a very huge week it&apos;s a</text><text start="2957.71" dur="4.17">very diverse we that have very different</text><text start="2959.6"

it&apos;ll</text><text start="2967.7" dur="3.84">be a very generalized answer which I can</text><text start="2969.47" dur="5.67">do I&apos;ll do it but it&apos;ll be almost</text><text start="2971.54" dur="5.4">platitude like okay we&apos;ll take that and</text><text start="2975.14" dur="4.08">then we&apos;ll reframe it afterwards after</text><text start="2976.94" dur="6.99">we see what we see how that that fits</text><text start="2979.22" dur="9.69">great thank you because it&apos;s important</text><text start="2983.93" dur="7.8">to note if I was talking with the</text><text start="2988.91" dur="5.01">American retail Association what can we</text><text start="2991.73" dur="3.69">do and it&apos;s the heads of the large</text><text start="2993.92" dur="3.21">retail businesses we could really talk</text><text start="2995.42" dur="3.33">through with the things that they&apos;re</text><text start="2997.13" dur="3.09">capable of doing and what their mandates</text><text start="2998.75" dur="2.88">the shareholders are whatever what could</text><text start="3000.22" dur="3.0">they actually do we could start to map</text><text start="3001.63" dur="3.06">out the opportunity space and

dur="5.19">Council or a local group of farmers we</text><text start="3008.05" dur="4.86">could answer that right or or the</text><text start="3011.26" dur="5.73">association of accountants or whatever</text><text start="3012.91" dur="6.27">it is right but when it&apos;s this broad</text><text start="3016.99" dur="4.14">people don&apos;t have a shared sense of what</text><text start="3019.18" dur="4.53">the desirable world is anything more</text><text start="3021.13" dur="4.62">than just like a feeling right is it</text><text start="3023.71" dur="4.11">more libertarian or is it more socialist</text><text start="3025.75" dur="4.11">yeah they&apos;re more different than most</text><text start="3027.82" dur="3.66">people acknowledge and there&apos;s other</text><text start="3029.86" dur="3.33">projects of what we&apos;re doing towards it</text><text start="3031.48" dur="3.15">is it more kind of permaculture a</text><text start="3033.19" dur="3.0">low-tech or super high-tech</text><text start="3034.63" dur="4.11">transhumanist upload my brain to the</text><text start="3036.19" dur="5.88">cloud like even what is desirable is</text><text start="3038.74" dur="4.53">thought very very differently and our</text><text start="3042.07" dur="2.25">levels of understanding of how to</text><text start="3043.27" dur="5.64">advance towards that plus our</text><text start="3044.32" dur="7.32">capabilities so I&apos;m just noticing that</text><text start="3048.91" dur="5.34">there there&apos;s kind of baked in frames</text><text start="3051.64" dur="5.46">and the way we ask those questions that</text><text start="3054.25" dur="4.56">are worth exploring yeah and I&apos;m just</text><text start="3057.1" dur="3.9">I&apos;m like you know I just wanted to be in</text><text start="3058.81" dur="7.23">the kind of presence to the inquiry kind</text><text start="3061.0" dur="6.27">of moment here and you know you think</text><text start="3066.04" dur="2.31">you talk about you know and I know you</text><text start="3067.27" dur="3.69">don&apos;t like to wear an impact you talk</text><text start="3068.35" dur="5.57">about you know impact work or all of</text><text start="3070.96" dur="5.49">these things that we use to describe</text><text start="3073.92" dur="4.3">like the things that we&apos;re doing but I</text><text start="3076.45" dur="2.79">think in in general I&apos;m just kind of</text><text start="3078.22" dur="2.19">confronted with the fact that it&apos;s</text><text start="3079.24" dur="3.81">actually not very well questioned</text><text start="3080.41" dur="4.62">we&apos;d actually don&apos;t we don&apos;t say what we</text><text start="3083.05" dur="5.13">mean by them we don&apos;t or at least we</text><text start="3085.03" dur="5.34">don&apos;t have a what have a reliable</text><text start="3088.18" dur="4.77">definition that could be could be shared</text><text start="3090.37" dur="4.61">amongst a lot of people but we speak to</text><text start="3092.95" dur="9.63">a spectrum as if there are real things</text><text start="3094.98" dur="10.72">yeah and to an evangelical protesting</text><text start="3102.58" dur="8.31">abortion clinics is doing impact work</text><text start="3105.7" dur="7.08">and to say certain democratically</text><text start="3110.89" dur="3.66">oriented people supporting Planned</text><text start="3112.78" dur="4.11">Parenthood fundraising is impact work</text><text start="3114.55" dur="5.4">and they&apos;re out there two pieces of</text><text start="3116.89" dur="5.12">impact work equally earnestly motivated</text><text start="3119.95" dur="5.24">a direct war with each other right and</text><text start="3122.01" dur="5.23">the same is true about like</text><text start="3125.19" dur="3.64">environmentalism and climate change work</text><text start="3127.24" dur="7.08">versus oil worker rights for an oil</text><text start="3128.83" dur="7.77">Union right and so yeah it&apos;s just worth</text><text start="3134.32" dur="9.14">thinking more precisely about some of</text><text start="3136.6" dur="9.9">these things we&apos;re gonna say no please</text><text start="3143.46" dur="5.65">to take it to even an even smaller scale</text><text start="3146.5" dur="5.28">all right okay we&apos;ve gone to the cross</text><text start="3149.11" dur="5.58">section to maybe some of these regional</text><text start="3151.78" dur="6.12">spaces and now very niche environments</text><text start="3154.69" dur="4.92">but take it to even a smaller scale I&apos;m</text><text start="3157.9" dur="5.28">curious what are some questions that you</text><text start="3159.61" dur="6.3">ask yourself before you decide that you</text><text start="3163.18" dur="5.79">care enough about something to put some</text><text start="3165.91" dur="5.61">effort into knowing about it growing it</text><text start="3168.97" dur="6.12">putting your focus to it so that when</text><text start="3171.52" dur="6.45">people that are listening to this have</text><text start="3175.09" dur="5.07">their own experience and their own self</text><text start="3177.97" dur="5.07">inquiry decide if they they care enough</text><text start="3180.16" dur="5.67">about something like what are those</text><text start="3183.04" dur="5.22">questions to be asking ourselves at that</text><text start="3185.83" dur="5.61">time to see if we should be putting our</text><text start="3188.26" dur="6.9">effort or our attention or our study or</text><text start="3191.44" dur="4.89">our intelligence or our heart with what</text><text start="3195.16" dur="3.95">all the things that we can care about</text><text start="3196.33" dur="6.27">because we can care about all of it in</text><text start="3199.11" dur="4.89">in very equal ways but to get down to</text><text start="3202.6" dur="3.81">where we&apos;re not just sitting there</text><text start="3204.0" dur="5.38">taking in all the information but</text><text start="3206.41" dur="4.71">actually putting out something what are</text><text start="3209.38" dur="4.86">what are some good questions that we</text><text start="3211.12" dur="4.71">could be asking ourselves maybe</text><text start="3214.24" dur="6.33">how are you asking yourself when you</text><text start="3215.83" dur="9.84">choose to do something yeah it&apos;s a good</text><text start="3220.57" dur="7.77">question it&apos;s interesting though though</text><text start="3225.67" dur="7.5">how that we effects it how different it</text><text start="3228.34" dur="6.21">is when I if I&apos;m at phases in my life</text><text start="3233.17" dur="2.94">where I haven&apos;t had any projects I was</text><text

dur="4.23">it&apos;s just with my own bandwidth right</text><text start="3241.48" dur="3.78">versus initiating a project and now</text><text start="3243.79" dur="3.99">there&apos;s a team so I have way more</text><text start="3245.26" dur="5.19">bandwidth but I also have way more</text><text start="3247.78" dur="4.35">output it is expected to be able to keep</text><text start="3250.45"

dur="7.711">though there&apos;s more more total capacity</text><text start="3264.369" dur="6.991">right and this is why they experience it</text><text start="3268.33" dur="5.1">actually running a business or running a</text><text start="3271.36" dur="4.23">non-profit where you&apos;re responsible for</text><text start="3273.43" dur="6.2">the finance is a can be a very valuable</text><text

opportunity cost of what</text><text start="3350.059" dur="4.47">other things am I not doing to do this</text><text start="3351.92" dur="5.669">thing right so those are types of</text><text start="3354.529" dur="5.22">frameworks that are very basic but they</text><text start="3357.589" dur="5.25">can be valuable to think about the</text><text start="3359.749" dur="5.701">finiteness of time well yeah if your</text><text start="3362.839" dur="7.141">classic two by two matrix even more</text><text start="3365.45" dur="8.46">basic let&apos;s just say yeah make it even</text><text start="3369.98" dur="9.389">more basic let&apos;s say you&apos;re one with two</text><text start="3373.91" dur="8.82">hands and a life choice to make all</text><text start="3379.369" dur="5.94">right very basic and a lot of people are</text><text start="3382.73" dur="5.46">that one person in that one room right</text><text start="3385.309" dur="5.97">now with just two hands and that one</text><text start="3388.19" dur="5.309">life choice to make right now and so I&apos;m</text><text start="3391.279" dur="4.381">curious what questions would they be</text><text start="3393.499" dur="5.37">asking themselves about what&apos;s in each</text><text start="3395.66" dur="5.639">hand to help them decide on what that</text><text start="3398.869" dur="4.2">one choice it&apos;s cuz and maybe that</text><text start="3401.299" dur="3.99">choice for them is like that one thing</text><text start="3403.069" dur="4.351">that they&apos;ve been kind of putting off</text><text start="3405.289" dur="3.871">their entire life and this quarantine</text><text start="3407.42" dur="5.939">moment is that moment for them to</text><text start="3409.16" dur="5.909">actually make that choice so now the way</text><text start="3413.359" dur="4.17">you frame that as a rephrasing of what</text><text start="3415.069" dur="4.74">Michael asked because that one person is</text><text start="3417.529" dur="3.84">now the one person avatar of the we</text><text start="3419.809" dur="4.111">which is to everybody because when</text><text start="3421.369" dur="5.13">people are all

dur="7.861">things get very undistinguished is again</text><text start="3449.059" dur="3.3">the same question but actually be</text><text start="3450.14" dur="4.679">examined it&apos;s not very distinct it&apos;s</text><text start="3452.359" dur="4.561">very generalized so let&apos;s let&apos;s hear the</text><text start="3454.819" dur="3.96">generalize answers even though it may</text><text start="3456.92" dur="3.75">not be a very effective answer I think</text><text start="3458.779" dur="7.71">it&apos;s it&apos;s worth now at least hearing and</text><text start="3460.67" dur="8.76">exploring that what we&apos;re asking is how</text><text start="3466.489" dur="4.29">do humans live a meaningful life right</text><text start="3469.43" dur="4.77">like that&apos;s the question you&apos;re asking</text><text start="3470.779" dur="5.22">is how do different humans who want</text><text start="3474.2" dur="3.84">their life to contribute to the</text><text start="3475.999" dur="5.791">well-being of the whole in some ways</text><text start="3478.04" dur="7.62">have their life actually be well engaged</text><text start="3481.79" dur="6.66">and well used

start="3490.58" dur="3.09">right so that&apos;s why I said what I&apos;m</text><text start="3492.53" dur="2.55">gonna answer is gonna end up being</text><text start="3493.67" dur="4.86">pretty general because it&apos;s a big</text><text start="3495.08" dur="6.77">question and it&apos;s a so a few things I</text><text start="3498.53" dur="6.57">can say the reason I was pointing out</text><text

dur="5.46">contribute to realizing that most of the</text><text start="3541.07" dur="4.799">things that people do actually elicit</text><text start="3543.77" dur="5.76">counter responses and drive

communication</text><text start="3561.32" dur="2.31">app so we can just send these tweets to</text><text start="3562.67" dur="2.49">each other because that seems really</text><text start="3563.63" dur="3.78">like it&apos;s kind of cool the short thing</text><text start="3565.16" dur="3.63">and then all of a sudden World War 3 is</text><text start="3567.41" dur="3.18">being waged over it because the</text><text start="3568.79" dur="3.78">president is using it news like oh</text><text start="3570.59" dur="3.99">with it those were big unintended</text><text start="3572.57" dur="5.91">consequences of the things that we were</text><text start="3574.58" dur="5.97">doing so so how do we make sense of the</text><text start="3578.48" dur="4.08">world make sense of what is actually</text><text start="3580.55" dur="4.71">good and write and think through the</text><text start="3582.56" dur="4.2">effects of our actions right and then</text><text start="3585.26" dur="2.7">how do we actually act on those things</text><text start="3586.76" dur="3.77">in a prioritized way and how do we</text><text start="3587.96" dur="5.54">increase our capacity to keep doing so</text><text start="3590.53" dur="5.56">those are I think some reframes of the</text><text start="3593.5" dur="5.859">underneath the question you&apos;re asking if</text><text start="3596.09" dur="4.2">I was trying to be more precise and so</text><text start="3599.359" dur="5.581">the main thing I would say is like</text><text start="3600.29" dur="6.81">there&apos;s a there&apos;s a development of the</text><text start="3604.94" dur="3.75">humans there&apos;s the engagement of us but</text><text start="3607.1" dur="3.7">also the development of us so that our</text><text start="3608.69" dur="6.94">engagement keeps being better guided and</text><text start="3610.8" dur="6.99">effective right and this is the how do I</text><text start="3615.63" dur="4.62">know more about what&apos;s going on how do I</text><text start="3617.79" dur="4.17">do a better job at prioritizing how do I</text><text start="3620.25" dur="4.62">do a better job of communicating and</text><text start="3621.96" dur="8.64">compelling in effective ways all those</text><text start="3624.87" dur="8.49">things and how do I make sure that what</text><text start="3630.6" dur="4.98">I&apos;m doing is actually what&apos;s most</text><text start="3633.36" dur="6.78">meaningful to me and my time isn&apos;t just</text><text start="3635.58" dur="7.68">hijacked by habit addiction fear lack of</text><text start="3640.14" dur="5.22">courage distraction and other things</text><text start="3643.26" dur="3.63">right that&apos;s one of the that&apos;s one of</text><text start="3645.36" dur="4.11">the biggest ones is what are the things</text><text start="3646.89" dur="4.05">that are hijacking your attention that</text><text start="3649.47" dur="3.3">on your deathbed will not be some of</text><text start="3650.94" dur="3.21">your highlights right that won&apos;t be the</text><text start="3652.77" dur="3.36">like those are the things that I&apos;m</text><text start="3654.15" dur="3.96">really proud of or feel really grateful</text><text start="3656.13" dur="4.58">about and how can you become</text><text start="3658.11" dur="5.96">progressively less hijacked by those</text><text start="3660.71" dur="6.7">also humans have complex motivation</text><text start="3664.07" dur="4.75">right I want to make these amazing</text><text start="3667.41" dur="3.81">things happen in the world why well</text><text start="3668.82" dur="5.25">because I want to save all these kids</text><text start="3671.22" dur="8.55">over here why well because I care about</text><text start="3674.07" dur="7.44">those kids that&apos;s true but I also want</text><text start="3679.77" dur="5.76">the credit of being the guy who did that</text><text start="3681.51" dur="5.94">because of unresolved kind of wounded</text><text start="3685.53" dur="4.52">ego insecurities stuff where I want that</text><text start="3687.45" dur="5.67">particular credit and I think that</text><text start="3690.05" dur="4.33">chicks will actually dig it and I think</text><text start="3693.12" dur="3.21">I&apos;ll make some money in the process</text><text start="3694.38" dur="3.33">and it will address the fact that I</text><text start="3696.33" dur="2.97">never got approval for my parents that&apos;s</text><text start="3697.71" dur="3.93">I&apos;m projecting on whatever right like</text><text start="3699.3" dur="4.01">motive this complex so typically</text><text start="3701.64" dur="5.1">whenever someone is doing something</text><text start="3703.31" dur="5.38">there&apos;s like 10 or 15 different reasons</text><text start="3706.74" dur="3.93">they&apos;re actually doing in they&apos;re</text><text start="3708.69" dur="3.45">usually only aware of half of them half</text><text start="3710.67" dur="3.21">of them are subconscious even to them</text><text start="3712.14" dur="3.63">and of the ones they&apos;re aware of they</text><text start="3713.88" dur="3.06">usually only admit one or two in the</text><text start="3715.77" dur="4.65">executive summary of the project</text><text start="3716.94" dur="4.71">statement and so part of it also in</text><text start="3720.42" dur="2.97">terms of how to be more effective is to</text><text start="3721.65" dur="6.93">become more reflective into your own</text><text start="3723.39" dur="9.39">motives and how to heal the things that</text><text start="3728.58" dur="6.0">are actually siphoning energy away right</text><text start="3732.78" dur="2.94">as you grow and heal some of the motives</text><text start="3734.58" dur="2.64">will become deeper and some will become</text><text start="3735.72" dur="3.54">less so you want to know which are the</text><text start="3737.22" dur="3.42">ones that are coming from the deepest</text><text start="3739.26" dur="2.94">truth of who I am and which are the ones</text><text start="3740.64" dur="3.49">that are coming from distraction trauma</text><text start="3742.2" dur="3.64">and security and other stuff</text><text start="3744.13" dur="3.87">so there&apos;s personal development to be</text><text start="3745.84" dur="4.08">able to have rather than mixed motives</text><text start="3748.0" dur="3.84">that are doing like two masters issues</text><text start="3749.92" dur="8.19">where it is more like a laser all</text><text start="3751.84" dur="8.46">coherent so I think what I just said is</text><text start="3758.11" dur="4.59">people need if they want to become more</text><text start="3760.3" dur="5.64">effective they need to study the topics</text><text start="3762.7" dur="4.41">they want to influence more like if</text><text start="3765.94" dur="3.45">you&apos;re really wanting to help with food</text><text start="3767.11" dur="4.23">security stuff you better study soil and</text><text start="3769.39" dur="4.38">agriculture and different types of</text><text start="3771.34" dur="3.77">agricultural systems and why it went the</text><text start="3773.77" dur="3.33">way that it went what are the financial</text><text start="3775.11" dur="3.7">challenges whatever so that you</text><text start="3777.1" dur="2.73">understand what is the problem space</text><text start="3778.81" dur="3.39">well enough to come up with good</text><text start="3779.83" dur="8.13">solutions so you need to kind of</text><text start="3782.2" dur="8.16">actually study the space you need to</text><text start="3787.96" dur="3.78">look at what things you can implement</text><text start="3790.36" dur="3.84">because there&apos;s a bunch of stuff you&apos;ll</text><text start="3791.74" dur="4.05">only learn by doing and as you start to</text><text start="3794.2" dur="3.27">do it you&apos;ll learn in the process a</text><text start="3795.79" dur="4.14">tremendous amount of stuff so what can i</text><text start="3797.47" dur="5.19">implement with my current capacities so</text><text start="3799.93" dur="4.11">that as I&apos;m studying more one I&apos;m having</text><text start="3802.66" dur="5.09">impact now and I&apos;m learning in a</text><text start="3804.04" dur="6.06">tangible grounded way and how can I both</text><text start="3807.75" dur="4.03">continuously be reminded of what&apos;s most</text><text start="3810.1" dur="3.93">meaningful to me so that I don&apos;t get</text><text start="3811.78" dur="5.28">distracted and hijacked it hijacked and</text><text start="3814.03" dur="4.83">how can I be engaged in a kind of</text><text start="3817.06" dur="8.88">personal development process that makes</text><text start="3818.86" dur="8.58">my motivation itself clearer and so</text><text start="3825.94" dur="3.84">those are the questions I would ask</text><text start="3827.44" dur="7.32">underneath it would give rise to the how</text><text start="3829.78" dur="7.95">can we do good things and my main answer</text><text start="3834.76" dur="5.07">would be the easiest way to succeed at</text><text start="3837.73" dur="4.58">that is to interact with people who are</text><text start="3839.83" dur="5.04">succeeding at that better more often</text><text start="3842.31" dur="4.51">you&apos;ll be the average of the five people</text><text start="3844.87" dur="4.08">you spend the most time around all the</text><text start="3846.82" dur="4.56">proximity is destiny all those types of</text><text start="3848.95" dur="4.29">statements we are social primates more</text><text start="3851.38" dur="3.15">than we like to admit and that&apos;s why we</text><text start="3853.24" dur="4.05">spend our time on Facebook and Instagram</text><text start="3854.53" dur="4.56">just actually scrolling at pictures of</text><text start="3857.29" dur="3.71">other primates right like that&apos;s the</text><text start="3859.09" dur="4.35">thing that really captures us is</text><text start="3861.0" dur="4.3">and it&apos;s so interesting because what</text><text start="3863.44" dur="3.75">we&apos;re it&apos;s like junk food where you</text><text start="3865.3" dur="3.81">extract the salt fat and sugar and</text><text start="3867.19" dur="3.72">remove all the nutrients so you maximize</text><text start="3869.11" dur="3.3">the hyper normal stimuli without any of</text><text start="3870.91" dur="4.47">the real thing and that&apos;s what the</text><text start="3872.41" dur="5.399">social media thing is is it it maximizes</text><text start="3875.38" dur="3.869">the likes and pictures and interaction</text><text start="3877.809" dur="4.29">in total number of people while removing</text><text start="3879.249" dur="6.06">almost all actual kinds of real contact</text><text start="3882.099" dur="6.571">and vulnerability that are scary but it</text><text start="3885.309" dur="5.28">shows the longing for social contact and</text><text start="3888.67" dur="5.819">then also the way we&apos;re influenced by</text><text start="3890.589" dur="6.15">what we&apos;re around so if people want to</text><text start="3894.489" dur="5.641">actually be doing more interesting</text><text start="3896.739" dur="4.83">things so in each of those areas how do</text><text start="3900.13" dur="4.889">I get how do I do the personal</text><text start="3901.569" dur="6.18">development to have ego and

dur="5.22">keeping you up at night like what&apos;s the</text><text start="3997.239" dur="7.32">thing for you and the real real what&apos;s</text><text start="4000.689" dur="6.99">the real thing that you are just hyper</text><text start="4004.559" dur="6.941">focused on getting as much information</text><text start="4007.679" dur="7.151">as possible right and what&apos;s the one</text><text start="4011.5" dur="8.01">learning that just blew your mind about</text><text start="4014.83" dur="7.77">it so far one of the questions that has</text><text start="4019.51" dur="14.01">been very central in my mind lately is</text><text start="4022.6" dur="16.28">how do we how to architecture social</text><text start="4033.52" dur="5.36">systems that do not reward sociopathy</text><text start="4040.05" dur="6.15">sociopathy narcissism sadism or any</text><text start="4042.97" dur="11.16">other basically power seeking</text><text start="4046.2" dur="11.08">dispositions that also are either like</text><text start="4054.13" dur="7.8">to or are willing to cause harm with the</text><text start="4057.28" dur="6.48">application of that power underneath so</text><text start="4061.93" dur="4.98">many of the problems in the world is</text><text start="4063.76" dur="5.34">that the people who are power seeking</text><text start="4066.91" dur="3.45">and willing to use power in ways to gain</text><text start="4069.1" dur="2.73">more power end up being the most</text><text start="4070.36" dur="7.76">powerful people in the world in defining</text><text start="4071.83" dur="10.17">the world and the people who care about</text><text start="4078.12" dur="6.34">the global Commons who don&apos;t want to</text><text start="4082.0" dur="4.41">cause harm and who want power seeking</text><text start="4084.46" dur="3.84">themselves usually don&apos;t get much power</text><text start="4086.41" dur="4.65">which means that they don&apos;t influence</text><text start="4088.3" dur="6.21">the the the overall dynamics of the</text><text start="4091.06" dur="5.25">space and it&apos;s clear to me that we</text><text start="4094.51" dur="9.21">definitely go extinct if that stays true</text><text start="4096.31" dur="9.09">and so this is you know this this is an</text><text start="4103.72" dur="3.51">old question this is kind of the purpose</text><text start="4105.4" dur="3.66">of law right the purpose of law is to</text><text start="4107.23" dur="3.69">collectively define what are the types</text><text start="4109.06" dur="4.68">of really predatory behaviors we agree</text><text start="4110.92" dur="7.55">we don&apos;t do and we will we will shut</text><text start="4113.74" dur="7.44">those down but of course throughout time</text><text start="4118.47" dur="5.43">it&apos;s like a civilization will create an</text><text start="4121.18" dur="4.889">effective legal system and then the</text><text start="4123.9" dur="3.939">legal and governance system the</text><text start="4126.069" dur="4.411">government is supposed to make laws that</text><text start="4127.839" dur="4.71">regulate the very predatory aspects of</text><text start="4130.48" dur="5.52">of markets and personal advantage</text><text start="4132.549" dur="6.301">seeking but then that means that the</text><text start="4136.0" dur="5.58">main goal of those predatory markets is</text><text start="4138.85" dur="4.949">to get around or capture the regulator&apos;s</text><text start="4141.58" dur="3.4">right which is what we call the watchdog</text><text start="4143.799" dur="3.491">issue so they</text><text start="4144.98" dur="5.85">have to figure out how to hide it right</text><text start="4147.29" dur="5.37">so seven offshore accounts that are hard</text><text start="4150.83" dur="3.39">to penetrate or whatever it is or they</text><text start="4152.66" dur="4.349">have to figure out how to pay for the</text><text start="4154.22" dur="4.74">campaign budgets and pay for the</text><text start="4157.009" dur="7.131">legislators that effect so they&apos;ve</text><text start="4158.96" dur="9.18">captured the watchdog functionally and</text><text start="4164.14" dur="6.099">so typically the people who are oriented</text><text start="4168.14" dur="7.32">to advance personal power are good at</text><text start="4170.239" dur="7.441">finding niches to do so and so then the</text><text start="4175.46" dur="5.22">question is how do we rigorously close</text><text start="4177.68" dur="5.909">all those niches where those types of</text><text start="4180.68" dur="4.909">behavior are never incented and that and</text><text start="4183.589" dur="6.111">don&apos;t end up gaining power and the</text><text start="4185.589" dur="7.331">decision-making across the space is</text><text start="4189.7" dur="6.4">actually the the power of choice making</text><text start="4192.92" dur="9.0">is also bound to wisdom wisdom goodness</text><text start="4196.1" dur="8.28">those types of things I could talk about</text><text start="4201.92" dur="5.069">this a lot like what doesn&apos;t work and</text><text start="4204.38" dur="3.9">what could work and but you asked me</text><text start="4206.989" dur="3.241">what&apos;s something I&apos;m thinking about a</text><text start="4208.28" dur="4.44">lot and what&apos;s something that surprised</text><text start="4210.23" dur="5.82">me something that surprised me as I</text><text start="4212.72" dur="11.24">started to study this was how much the</text><text start="4216.05" dur="7.91">world is actually run by sociopaths and</text><text start="4225.76" dur="7.72">say this in many cases within say this</text><text start="4231.29" dur="4.56">just basically means sociopath is</text><text start="4233.48" dur="5.37">willing to cause harm to advance their</text><text start="4235.85" dur="5.07">goal but the that cause harm isn&apos;t the</text><text start="4238.85" dur="4.59">goal but there are some people for whom</text><text start="4240.92" dur="6.89">they have actually kind of fetishized</text><text start="4243.44" dur="4.37">the exercising of their power right and</text><text start="4248.23" dur="4.57">and we&apos;ve certainly seen heaps of cases</text><text start="4251.03" dur="3.709">of this throughout history it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="4252.8" dur="7.35">still true it&apos;s just generally hidden</text><text start="4254.739" dur="8.261">but the book the dictators handbook is a</text><text start="4260.15" dur="4.65">nice kind of intro to it there&apos;s a short</text><text start="4263.0" dur="3.09">little cartoon that somebody made on</text><text start="4264.8" dur="4.23">YouTube that was really good

thinking</text><text start="4284.84" dur="6.06">through better and engage in some of</text><text start="4286.489" dur="6.271">those tactics and so how how do you not</text><text start="4290.9" dur="3.87">get beaten by warring cultures without</text><text start="4292.76" dur="3.299">becoming a warring culture right and</text><text start="4294.77" dur="2.94">throughout history so many of the</text><text start="4296.059" dur="2.881">peaceful cultures just got slaughtered</text><text start="4297.71" dur="3.75">by the warring cultures or they had to</text><text start="4298.94" dur="6.119">stop being peaceful cultures so like</text><text start="4301.46" dur="5.88">this this question and I used to think</text><text start="4305.059" dur="5.43">more just in terms of system disposition</text><text start="4307.34" dur="5.549">well it&apos;s based on the nature of what is</text><text start="4310.489" dur="4.32">being incentivized and what&apos;s perverse</text><text

start="4501.08" dur="3.18">something or taking in information and</text><text start="4502.7" dur="3.9">it&apos;s actually mostly the grappling with</text><text start="4504.26" dur="4.11">it it&apos;s mostly the digestion and</text><text start="4506.6" dur="4.08">processing where it becomes your own and</text><text start="4508.37" dur="3.63">the most insightful thing do you usually</text><text start="4510.68" dur="2.76">get from a book wasn&apos;t written in the</text><text start="4512.0" dur="3.06">book it was your own insights that came</text><text start="4513.44" dur="6.45">from really

start="4521.84" dur="3.27">theory that when you start to teach</text><text start="4523.64" dur="3.81">something you start to learn in a new</text><text start="4525.11" dur="3.72">way because now you have to you have to</text><text start="4527.45" dur="2.91">be able to explain the questions and you</text><text start="4528.83" dur="3.45">have to do something with it right and</text><text start="4530.36" dur="3.54">this way so often someone will read</text><text start="4532.28" dur="4.05">something and they can recall a very</text><text start="4533.9" dur="5.22">small percentage because it there hasn&apos;t</text><text start="4536.33" dur="5.37">yet been an evolutionary impulse to say</text><text start="4539.12" dur="3.78">this matters enough to remember it</text><text start="4541.7" dur="3.33">because I was just reading it but when I</text><text start="4542.9" dur="3.27">think about why is this relevant what</text><text start="4545.03" dur="3.24">will I do with it it starts</text><text start="4546.17" dur="4.52">to kind of neurologically store</text><text start="4548.27" dur="2.42">differently</text><text start="4551.949" dur="5.02">so in general when I&apos;m reading I</text><text start="4554.949" dur="4.031">actually read pretty slowly</text><text start="4556.969" dur="4.201">because I&apos;m reading something and then</text><text start="4558.98" dur="4.05">I&apos;m looking up references and then I&apos;m</text><text start="4561.17" dur="2.97">thinking about it and I&apos;m relating it</text><text start="4563.03" dur="3.6">with various other things that I&apos;ve</text><text start="4564.14" dur="4.079">known and so it&apos;s more like reading as</text><text start="4566.63" dur="4.47">the center of a research process</text><text
