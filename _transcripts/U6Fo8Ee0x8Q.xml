start="11.679" dur="4.0">know what&apos;s going on so the idea of a</text><text start="13.679" dur="4.161">comprehensively educated public and a</text><text start="15.679" dur="4.161">comprehensively informed public which</text><text start="17.84" dur="4.08">means education and the fourth estate or</text><text start="19.84" dur="4.08">news you know media were considered</text><text start="21.92" dur="3.119">prerequisite institutions for democracy</text><text start="23.92" dur="3.519">to function</text><text start="25.039" dur="4.56">and that started with a newspaper and</text><text start="27.439" dur="4.0">the newspaper ended up evolving into</text><text start="29.599" dur="3.841">radio and television you know news</text><text start="31.439" dur="4.081">stations but they were the element of</text><text start="33.44" dur="3.6">broadcast that you had some small number</text><text start="35.52" dur="2.8">of news stations that could put</text><text start="37.04" dur="2.64">something out and everybody could read</text><text start="38.32" dur="2.8">the same thing they could agree or not</text><text start="39.68" dur="3.039">agree they could react against it but</text><text start="41.12" dur="4.16">they were at least getting some shared</text><text start="42.719" dur="4.16">sense of base reality to then be able to</text><text start="45.28" dur="4.799">make governance choices based on that</text><text start="46.879" dur="4.721">was kind of critical to democracy now</text><text start="50.079" dur="3.761">when the internet emerged and we went</text><text start="51.6" dur="4.0">from a few publishers to everyone can be</text><text start="53.84" dur="3.359">publishers and there was such a flood of</text><text start="55.6" dur="3.2">information that nobody could possibly</text><text start="57.199" dur="3.04">see all of the relevant information and</text><text start="58.8" dur="4.16">you have a billion search results for</text><text start="60.239" dur="4.081">any search topic then what i see isn&apos;t</text><text start="62.96" dur="2.72">going to be me searching through all of</text><text start="64.32" dur="3.2">that it&apos;s going to be</text><text start="65.68" dur="4.08">some ai that can go through those</text><text start="67.52" dur="4.0">billion search results and curate</text><text start="69.76" dur="3.76">recommended videos for me or curate a</text><text start="71.52" dur="4.16">news feed of content and what is the</text><text start="73.52" dur="4.08">basis of how it curates it so as we all</text><text start="75.68" dur="3.439">know from if we pay attention if we&apos;ve</text><text start="77.6" dur="4.24">ever looked at a friend&apos;s</text><text start="79.119" dur="3.841">facebook page if i have someone in the</text><text start="81.84" dur="2.88">middle of the country who&apos;s maybe</text><text start="82.96" dur="3.76">politically right and someone on the</text><text start="84.72" dur="3.92">coast of the country is politically left</text><text start="86.72" dur="4.079">their facebook news feeds probably have</text><text start="88.64" dur="4.56">not a single piece of content in common</text><text start="90.799" dur="3.841">about the news of the world and so</text><text start="93.2" dur="3.2">not only do they have no content in</text><text start="94.64" dur="3.519">common how could you possibly run a</text><text start="96.4" dur="3.039">democracy if people don&apos;t have a shared</text><text start="98.159" dur="2.401">sense of what&apos;s going on in the world</text><text start="99.439" dur="2.401">it&apos;s only that they don&apos;t have it in</text><text start="100.56" dur="3.44">common it&apos;s that they have things that</text><text start="101.84" dur="3.76">are increasingly polarizing because the</text><text start="104.0" dur="3.119">algorithm is optimizing for their</text><text start="105.6" dur="3.44">attention and their engagement and it</text><text start="107.119" dur="4.0">happens to be that the things that</text><text start="109.04" dur="3.52">scare people and outrage them and create</text><text start="111.119" dur="2.561">tribal identity and create certainty are</text><text start="112.56" dur="3.199">the things that make people spend more</text><text start="113.68" dur="4.16">time on site and make them engage more</text><text start="115.759" dur="4.561">what&apos;s happening is not only that the</text><text start="117.84" dur="4.16">sense of shared base reality is broken</text><text start="120.32" dur="3.439">but that the realities are becoming</text><text start="122.0" dur="3.2">increasingly polarized and as the</text><text start="123.759" dur="3.601">population becomes increasingly</text><text start="125.2" dur="3.679">polarized they elect and support</text><text start="127.36" dur="3.599">representatives that become increasingly</text><text start="128.879" dur="3.681">polarized which means that the integrity</text><text start="130.959" dur="3.521">of government itself</text><text start="132.56" dur="4.08">becomes increasingly gridlocked and</text><text start="134.48" dur="2.88">increasingly broken down so can you run</text><text start="136.64" dur="2.959">a</text><text start="137.36" dur="3.519">open society can you run a democracy</text><text start="139.599" dur="2.72">where the citizens have as their</text><text start="140.879" dur="3.201">greatest enemy each other where they</text><text start="142.319" dur="3.041">have no shared sense of what is true and</text><text start="144.08" dur="2.56">they have no shared sense of what is</text><text start="145.36" dur="2.8">good and there&apos;s some kind of voting</text><text start="146.64" dur="3.36">that has to happen and anything that</text><text start="148.16" dur="3.439">either side advances makes the other</text><text start="150.0" dur="3.84">side feel more threatened that&apos;s the</text><text start="151.599" dur="4.64">process of the breakdown of a democracy</text><text start="153.84" dur="5.039">completely and so we can see that</text><text start="156.239" dur="5.521">facebook and youtube and basically the</text><text start="158.879" dur="4.401">attention directing tools broke the</text><text start="161.76" dur="3.04">fourth estate which means broke</text><text start="163.28" dur="3.679">democracy it&apos;s really critical to</text><text start="164.8" dur="4.159">understand that and when we think of an</text><text start="166.959" dur="4.161">oil company that maybe before we had an</text><text start="168.959" dur="3.761">oil company we didn&apos;t have laws about</text><text start="171.12" dur="3.119">oil spills or about where we would do</text><text start="172.72" dur="4.239">drilling and so we had to deal with that</text><text start="174.239" dur="4.64">post facto the oil spill caused harm to</text><text start="176.959" dur="3.92">the commons but it didn&apos;t directly make</text><text start="178.879" dur="3.041">the government worse but the oil spill</text><text start="180.879" dur="3.841">we&apos;re talking about here where the</text><text start="181.92" dur="4.64">population is increasingly certain about</text><text start="184.72" dur="3.12">things that are increasingly wrong and</text><text start="186.56" dur="2.56">polarized against each other and so are</text><text start="187.84" dur="3.679">the representatives</text><text start="189.12" dur="3.92">that&apos;s the oil spill of tech their their</text><text start="191.519" dur="3.201">externality instead of dumping toxic</text><text start="193.04" dur="4.559">waste in a river they&apos;re dumping dumping</text><text start="194.72" dur="4.48">toxic polarization into society but the</text><text start="197.599" dur="3.041">toxic waste in the river didn&apos;t make</text><text start="199.2" dur="3.2">governance not work in the democracy</text><text start="200.64" dur="4.239">didn&apos;t break the democracy you&apos;re saying</text><text start="202.4" dur="3.839">that the toxic dump of polarization at</text><text start="204.879" dur="3.201">from the from these specific tech</text><text start="206.239" dur="3.201">companies as they dump that it&apos;s</text><text start="208.08" dur="2.719">breaking the very thing that we would</text><text start="209.44" dur="2.96">need to regulate it because the</text><text start="210.799" dur="3.921">regulation of this we would think would</text><text start="212.4" dur="3.839">come from the state but the state and is</text><text start="214.72" dur="3.36">fundamentally being broken by the</text><text start="216.239" dur="3.841">externality of these companies yeah</text><text start="218.08" dur="3.84">exactly so what&apos;s happening is as these</text><text start="220.08" dur="3.76">companies operate and polarize the</text><text start="221.92" dur="3.679">population so that the representatives</text><text start="223.84" dur="3.52">who have to appeal to their support base</text><text start="225.599" dur="2.801">can&apos;t possibly work together with each</text><text start="227.36" dur="2.239">other because if they work together with</text><text start="228.4" dur="2.88">each other they lose the increasingly</text><text start="229.599" dur="3.681">polarized support base not to mention</text><text start="231.28" dur="3.2">that the polarization actually affects</text><text start="233.28" dur="3.36">the representatives and even the</text><text start="234.48" dur="4.959">military themselves directly as these</text><text start="236.64" dur="5.44">infotech platforms continue to operate</text><text start="239.439" dur="5.281">they directly decrease the coherence of</text><text start="242.08" dur="4.799">government&apos;s capacity to govern at all</text><text start="244.72" dur="4.159">while increasing their own capacity to</text><text start="246.879" dur="3.761">influence the population and obviously</text><text start="248.879" dur="3.601">increasing the total</text><text start="250.64" dur="3.2">intelligence they have access to to know</text><text start="252.48" dur="3.2">how to change popular opinion to</text><text start="253.84" dur="3.44">continue to support what they do and in</text><text start="255.68" dur="3.2">addition to their financial capacity to</text><text start="257.28" dur="3.28">lobbying like that so they&apos;re becoming</text><text start="258.88" dur="3.84">exponentially more capable through the</text><text start="260.56" dur="4.16">application of exponential technologies</text><text start="262.72" dur="3.28">while creating an exponential decrease</text><text start="264.72" dur="2.64">on capability and coherence of the</text><text start="266.0" dur="3.759">government that would govern them and</text><text start="267.36" dur="4.24">you can&apos;t have a regulatory body</text><text start="269.759" dur="4.16">regulate something that is both more</text><text start="271.6" dur="4.159">powerful than it and growing faster than</text><text start="273.919" dur="3.361">it and that&apos;s the key underlying thing</text><text start="275.759" dur="3.44">that we&apos;re trying to say here is that</text><text start="277.28" dur="3.68">big tech is directly decreasing the</text><text start="279.199" dur="4.161">coherence of the government&apos;s capacity</text><text start="280.96" dur="4.08">to govern it and it is getting better</text><text
