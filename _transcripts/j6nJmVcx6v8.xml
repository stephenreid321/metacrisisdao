it&apos;s</text><text start="5.94" dur="4.59">really impossible to do good sense</text><text start="7.68" dur="4.98">making or to orient towards truth unless</text><text start="10.53" dur="5.309">we&apos;re prepared to disagree with our</text><text start="12.66" dur="5.97">in-group the essential thing to good</text><text start="15.839" dur="6.721">sense making is a commitment to</text><text start="18.63" dur="6.51">earnestness like a sincere profound</text><text start="22.56" dur="6.42">commitment to earnestness in our sense</text><text start="25.14" dur="10.05">making which means that the enemy of</text><text start="28.98" dur="10.259">that is bias of any kind and which means</text><text start="35.19" dur="6.06">vested interests of any kind and so the</text><text start="39.239" dur="3.511">desire to fit in my group is a source of</text><text start="41.25" dur="3.57">bias in vested interest because my group</text><text start="42.75" dur="6.36">might have things wrong or be missing</text><text start="44.82" dur="6.989">stuff and if they&apos;re willing to use you</text><text start="49.11" dur="5.879">know apostasy punishments if they&apos;re</text><text start="51.809" dur="5.311">willing to use if you&apos;re not with us</text><text start="54.989" dur="6.57">you&apos;re against us line in the sand kind</text><text start="57.12" dur="7.2">of stuff then they&apos;re not engaged in</text><text start="61.559" dur="4.321">good faith in trying to understand they</text><text start="64.32" dur="3.63">think that they have understood enough</text><text start="65.88" dur="6.09">and now they&apos;re engaged in winning a war</text><text start="67.95" dur="5.82">and so there is if you want to find a</text><text start="71.97" dur="3.18">way out of war and so you want to engage</text><text start="73.77" dur="3.81">in the kind of good sense making that</text><text start="75.15" dur="4.05">could inform that then you might be</text><text start="77.58" dur="4.26">against them if you aren&apos;t with them</text><text start="79.2" dur="6.36">right and so and we can see this again</text><text start="81.84" dur="5.58">on in fundamentalist interpretations of</text><text start="85.56" dur="3.989">lots of religious views and cultural</text><text start="87.42" dur="4.47">views on both sides of you know the</text><text start="89.549" dur="8.43">culture war we can see the way that the</text><text start="91.89" dur="9.089">Left evolved a very profound tool of</text><text start="97.979" dur="5.371">memetic shaming to be able to hold a</text><text start="100.979" dur="4.14">common narrative and to hold the</text><text start="103.35" dur="5.159">argument that they had the only source</text><text start="105.119" dur="8.64">of legitimate Authority and that looked</text><text start="108.509" dur="8.25">like largely kind of capturing control</text><text start="113.759" dur="5.311">of most of the academies and you know</text><text start="116.759" dur="4.231">government institutions and lots of</text><text start="119.07" dur="4.47">types of media for some period of time</text><text start="120.99" dur="3.809">but then saying you&apos;re a racist or</text><text start="123.54" dur="2.91">you&apos;re an anti-semite or you&apos;re</text><text start="124.799" dur="4.68">misogynist or you&apos;re bigoted or you&apos;re</text><text start="126.45" dur="6.71">xenophobe was effective for a long time</text><text start="129.479" dur="6.481">to just have people not</text><text start="133.16" dur="6.07">be able to engage in conversations it</text><text start="135.96" dur="4.8">might have had some actual legitimacy we</text><text start="139.23" dur="5.75">can see though that of course and I&apos;m</text><text start="140.76" dur="8.4">not saying anything new here that that</text><text start="144.98" dur="6.22">that as a weapon right that type of</text><text start="149.16" dur="6.33">social shaming as a type of narrative</text><text start="151.2" dur="5.79">weapon when any like in a physical war</text><text start="155.49" dur="3.12">when any side gets a new weapon the</text><text start="156.99" dur="2.76">other side start there engineers start</text><text start="158.61" dur="2.97">working really fast to make a counter</text><text start="159.75" dur="3.84">weapon defenses and better versions of</text><text start="161.58" dur="4.26">that weapon and so this is the thing</text><text start="163.59" dur="4.14">that when you think like oh we&apos;ve got</text><text start="165.84" dur="3.54">some new narrative that&apos;s gonna be</text><text start="167.73" dur="4.65">awesome or some new stat or some new</text><text start="169.38" dur="4.44">method of public engagement or getting</text><text start="172.38" dur="3.9">the voters that don&apos;t normally vote out</text><text start="173.82" dur="3.57">or whatever the thing is the moment it&apos;s</text><text start="176.28" dur="3.3">successful everybody will</text><text start="177.39" dur="5.4">reverse-engineer it and attack the basis</text><text start="179.58" dur="8.19">of how you do it and so we can see that</text><text start="182.79" dur="8.07">the coalescing of and the kind of</text><text start="187.77" dur="7.26">concretization of the alright was to a</text><text start="190.86" dur="6.66">large degree in response to a counter</text><text start="195.03" dur="4.26">response to those social shaming tools</text><text start="197.52" dur="4.32">which didn&apos;t come to the place of saying</text><text start="199.29" dur="5.46">like okay I&apos;ll embrace being racist I</text><text start="201.84" dur="5.37">will embrace having traditional views on</text><text start="204.75" dur="4.83">gender roles more fully than I might</text><text start="207.21" dur="4.4">have previously so that that shaming</text><text start="209.58" dur="4.41">tool doesn&apos;t work for me anymore and</text><text start="211.61" dur="4.33">grab her by the is totally fine</text><text start="213.99" dur="11.25">like we&apos;ll vote for that guy again</text><text start="215.94" dur="11.85">and so and you know there are similar</text><text start="225.24" dur="4.29">kinds of tools used on the right for</text><text start="227.79" dur="9.42">being able to create in group cohesion</text><text start="229.53" dur="9.87">and so yes I think their earnestness and</text><text start="237.21" dur="5.33">sincerity and the desire to understand</text><text start="239.4" dur="8.04">reality clearly is the foundation and</text><text start="242.54" dur="6.76">then the courage to actually ask those</text><text start="247.44" dur="3.84">questions and say the things you that</text><text start="249.3" dur="4.5">you think and notice in the presence of</text><text start="251.28" dur="4.2">an in-group that is trying to force you</text><text start="253.8" dur="4.189">to defect to the center of what that</text><text start="255.48" dur="5.28">group think is defect on your own self</text><text start="257.989" dur="4.391">there is courage but there&apos;s is this</text><text start="260.76" dur="2.85">interesting combination of courage and</text><text start="262.38" dur="2.13">humility that has to be there at the</text><text start="263.61" dur="4.89">same time</text><text start="264.51" dur="4.86">which is the courage to say I don&apos;t know</text><text start="268.5" dur="7.97">if I agree</text><text start="269.37" dur="9.93">I don&apos;t know that this perspective is</text><text start="276.47" dur="4.69">adequate even if I&apos;m compelled partially</text><text start="279.3" dur="3.45">by it I don&apos;t know that it&apos;s adequate</text><text start="281.16" dur="2.73">there are some other counter</text><text start="282.75" dur="2.46">perspectives that a lot of people</text><text start="283.89" dur="4.11">believe that I&apos;m not going to rule them</text><text start="285.21" dur="3.96">all as just dumb or pathological and so</text><text start="288.0" dur="3.03">I don&apos;t know if this perspectives</text><text start="289.17" dur="3.36">adequate and that more thinking is</text><text start="291.03" dur="2.67">needed there&apos;s courage to do that</text><text start="292.53" dur="4.8">because if you&apos;re not with us you&apos;re</text><text start="293.7" dur="5.07">against us as a powerful tactic but to</text><text start="297.33" dur="3.6">have that confidence and at the same</text><text start="298.77" dur="8.61">time say I don&apos;t know yet what I think</text><text start="300.93" dur="8.7">is true that is the humility side that</text><text start="307.38" dur="3.57">doesn&apos;t just have a new hubris that is</text><text start="309.63" dur="3.6">going to try and be the center of a new</text><text start="310.95" dur="4.2">narrative warfare and get people to you</text><text start="313.23" dur="4.47">know defect on the other sides to come</text><text start="315.15" dur="8.45">join that side so I think like</text><text start="317.7" dur="9.18">earnestness and sincerity empowered by</text><text start="323.6" dur="6.97">really deep courage and a deep kind of</text><text start="326.88" dur="5.79">epistemic humility is going to make</text><text start="330.57" dur="6.81">someone misfit for every end group</text><text start="332.67" dur="6.09">currently which is the valley crossing</text><text start="337.38" dur="3.57">that people have to go through to</text><text start="338.76" dur="4.98">basically leave the forces that are</text><text start="340.95" dur="6.57">irate arrayed in a war that we&apos;re all</text><text start="343.74" dur="6.06">sides are wrong to hopefully have enough</text><text start="347.52" dur="4.86">people who do that that start to find</text><text start="349.8" dur="6.53">each other and don&apos;t do a new tribal</text><text start="352.38" dur="6.96">groupthink thing but all engage in</text><text start="356.33" dur="5.17">earnest actual thinking themselves an</text><text start="359.34" dur="3.46">actual conversation without orienting</text><text start="361.5" dur="4.37">towards groupthink</text><text start="362.8" dur="9.29">that can start to make a new stranger</text><text start="365.87" dur="6.93">[Music]</text><text
