it&apos;s so great to have you on the</text><text start="40.469" dur="4.68">show today I&apos;m happy to be here thanks</text><text start="43.079" dur="5.07">for having a lot of things we can talk</text><text start="45.149" dur="4.441">about you&apos;re a very a very interesting</text><text start="48.149" dur="3.75">guy which is why I wanted to get you on</text><text start="49.59" dur="4.379">this show I knew there was lots of areas</text><text start="51.899" dur="3.361">that we could discuss I&apos;d like to first</text><text start="53.969" dur="3.84">start talking a little bit about your</text><text start="55.26" dur="4.29">childhood because you had a very</text><text start="57.809" dur="3.511">interesting educational path isn&apos;t that</text><text start="59.55" dur="4.469">right or a different I did have a</text><text start="61.32" dur="5.52">different educational path different and</text><text start="64.019" dur="4.681">interesting yeah both yeah tell me a</text><text start="66.84" dur="4.41">little bit about it and inserted how you</text><text start="68.7" dur="4.02">solved the education system yeah I</text><text start="71.25" dur="3.689">didn&apos;t know much about the education</text><text start="72.72" dur="6.0">system because I wasn&apos;t exposed to there</text><text start="74.939" dur="6.54">was a I was home taught growing up and I</text><text start="78.72" dur="4.77">went to public school for a very brief</text><text start="81.479" dur="4.651">period a few times as an experiment and</text><text start="83.49" dur="4.71">few different private schools but the</text><text start="86.13" dur="5.129">vast majority of my childhood education</text><text start="88.2" dur="4.879">homeschooled and the reason was my</text><text start="91.259" dur="4.29">parents were kind of educational</text><text start="93.079" dur="4.061">philosophers and were interested to see</text><text start="95.549" dur="3.601">what would happen at the kid didn&apos;t have</text><text start="97.14" dur="4.26">any fixed curriculum and was just</text><text start="99.15" dur="4.289">exposed to all the things they could be</text><text start="101.4" dur="3.87">exposed to and then their interests were</text><text start="103.439" dur="4.651">facilitated so it was a very kind of</text><text start="105.27" dur="4.59">constructivist idea so that was it I</text><text start="108.09" dur="4.68">didn&apos;t have a certain amount of social</text><text start="109.86" dur="5.16">studies and geography and math and</text><text start="112.77" dur="4.04">handwriting in English I it really was</text><text start="115.02" dur="4.44">just a facilitation of questions</text><text start="116.81" dur="4.36">fascination and interest so the few</text><text start="119.46" dur="3.42">times that I did go to school there were</text><text start="121.17" dur="3.6">obviously gaps in knowledge that</text><text start="122.88" dur="3.779">everyone else was learning like I had</text><text start="124.77" dur="5.01">never shown much interest growing up in</text><text start="126.659" dur="5.041">American history and understanding</text><text start="129.78" dur="3.96">states and capitals that kind of thing</text><text start="131.7" dur="4.05">they were areas where I was</text><text start="133.74" dur="3.51">setting things that were well outside of</text><text start="135.75" dur="3.39">the scope of anything that would</text><text start="137.25" dur="3.87">normally be touched in school and so we</text><text start="139.14" dur="4.23">didn&apos;t it didn&apos;t translate very well</text><text start="141.12" dur="5.55">what was of course wonderful about it</text><text start="143.37" dur="5.73">was I got to not only go very deep in</text><text start="146.67" dur="4.89">the areas that I had a main interest but</text><text start="149.1" dur="5.67">my actual interest in life itself was</text><text start="151.56" dur="4.92">fostered by having the interesting</text><text start="154.77" dur="3.3">topics supported and not being forced to</text><text start="156.48" dur="3.6">be focused on stuff that was of interest</text><text start="158.07" dur="4.56">yes it sounds like you were a pretty</text><text start="160.08" dur="4.53">curious person and you got a chance to</text><text start="162.63" dur="4.89">actually run with that as opposed to</text><text start="164.61" dur="5.42">being held back by that BA the term</text><text start="167.52" dur="4.89">curious person and child are synonymous</text><text start="170.03" dur="5.11">that&apos;s a good point that&apos;s a good point</text><text start="172.41" dur="6.54">you do see individual differences though</text><text start="175.14" dur="6.66">in curiosity and maybe that is partly</text><text start="178.95" dur="4.44">environmental supportive and as well as</text><text start="181.8" dur="3.81">I think genetics do play a role you know</text><text start="183.39" dur="3.93">in terms of dopamine production and</text><text start="185.61" dur="3.72">their genes that code for dopamine but I</text><text start="187.32" dur="3.6">think that that&apos;s a good point in a lot</text><text start="189.33" dur="3.66">of ways from evolution perspective you</text><text start="190.92" dur="3.81">need curiosity right you need or to</text><text start="192.99" dur="3.24">adapt I mean if you but child who&apos;s not</text><text start="194.73" dur="3.9">gonna explore their environments at all</text><text start="196.23" dur="4.38">you know the child will not be able to</text><text start="198.63" dur="5.88">adapt at all what do you study in</text><text start="200.61" dur="7.17">college I studied the math physics</text><text start="204.51" dur="4.95">philosophy and undergrad psychology more</text><text start="207.78" dur="5.61">philosophy in graduate school but then</text><text start="209.46" dur="6.39">getting into ecology biology medicine</text><text start="213.39" dur="4.8">complex systems most of that wasn&apos;t in a</text><text start="215.85" dur="4.08">formal academic situation it was in</text><text start="218.19" dur="3.96">independent studies and research</text><text start="219.93" dur="4.68">environments for instance medicine was</text><text start="222.15" dur="4.14">working with some different diagnostic</text><text start="224.61" dur="4.23">laboratories working with medical</text><text start="226.29" dur="4.8">doctors and clinics on complex cases and</text><text start="228.84" dur="3.6">working to try and find insights that</text><text start="231.09" dur="3.06">were outside of the scope of what we</text><text start="232.44" dur="4.34">currently had insights on well what was</text><text start="234.15" dur="6.51">the college you went to undergrad was</text><text start="236.78" dur="6.67">Mauri University in what our University</text><text start="240.66" dur="5.19">worth it looking it&apos;s in Iowa Fairfield</text><text start="243.45" dur="4.17">Iowa it was a very kind of unique school</text><text start="245.85" dur="5.55">that was focused on studying the</text><text start="247.62" dur="6.63">sciences with a deeper thought process</text><text start="251.4" dur="4.68">around subject/object relationship cool</text><text start="254.25" dur="3.27">so when did you start to think about</text><text start="256.08" dur="2.69">putting together this neuro hacker</text><text start="257.52" dur="3.48">collective how did that come about</text><text start="258.77" dur="4.0">now hacker is a relatively recent</text><text start="261.0" dur="5.85">project we started it about three years</text><text start="262.77" dur="4.869">ago and I have gotten into integrative</text><text start="266.85" dur="2.379">medicine</text><text start="267.639" dur="3.75">and kind of diagnostic medicine</text><text start="269.229" dur="4.5">therapeutic medicine especially for</text><text start="271.389" dur="3.78">cases that both allopathic and</text><text start="273.729" dur="3.87">integrative medicine didn&apos;t have</text><text start="275.169" dur="5.25">adequate solutions yet partially because</text><text start="277.599" dur="4.231">of my own diagnosed illnesses that</text><text start="280.419" dur="3.06">didn&apos;t have adequate solutions that I</text><text start="281.83" dur="3.329">had to work on and some of which had a</text><text start="283.479" dur="4.41">neurodegenerative component so I got</text><text start="285.159" dur="5.22">deep into understanding how neurological</text><text start="287.889" dur="4.231">systems work how dysfunction worse and</text><text start="290.379" dur="3.69">because there weren&apos;t any adequate</text><text start="292.12" dur="4.349">solutions offered anywhere of course the</text><text start="294.069" dur="4.38">only like meaningful option was see if</text><text start="296.469" dur="3.63">novel insights can be generated by</text><text start="298.449" dur="4.47">approaching it differently and so I</text><text start="300.099" dur="4.741">started applying cybernetic theory how</text><text start="302.919" dur="4.11">do the bottom-up and top-down regulatory</text><text start="304.84" dur="5.25">systems in the human organism work and</text><text start="307.029" dur="5.551">whole systems and complexity theory how</text><text start="310.09" dur="4.229">do all of the different comics and all</text><text start="312.58" dur="4.47">the different body systems interact and</text><text start="314.319" dur="5.31">have cascade effects and etc and it</text><text start="317.05" dur="5.429">ended up leading to a set of hypotheses</text><text start="319.629" dur="5.371">about how health works how aging works</text><text start="322.479" dur="4.68">and how illness works and then how</text><text start="325.0" dur="4.05">illness in a case like mine could have</text><text start="327.159" dur="3.991">worked led to me being able to do some</text><text start="329.05" dur="3.69">kind of unique research Diagnostics</text><text start="331.15" dur="4.319">find things out that traditional</text><text start="332.74" dur="4.59">medicine had not that led to me actually</text><text start="335.469" dur="3.54">being able to treat and reverse the</text><text start="337.33" dur="3.389">conditions I had that were you know</text><text start="339.009" dur="3.301">reverse autoimmune antibodies reversed</text><text start="340.719" dur="3.51">things that are not usually medically</text><text start="342.31" dur="3.449">thought of as reversible which led to me</text><text start="344.229" dur="3.481">then doing that with a lot of other</text><text start="345.759" dur="4.83">people who had you know working with</text><text start="347.71" dur="5.069">various integrative doctors who had also</text><text start="350.589" dur="4.86">what are traditionally beamed as</text><text start="352.779" dur="5.13">uncurable cases and getting to see that</text><text start="355.449" dur="4.981">we could reliably reversed some kinds of</text><text start="357.909" dur="4.44">pathology and then this was very</text><text start="360.43" dur="4.469">meaningful and that we could address not</text><text start="362.349" dur="4.38">only physical pathology but meaningfully</text><text start="364.899" dur="4.02">affect people&apos;s cognitive and</text><text start="366.729" dur="3.78">psychological function because with</text><text start="368.919" dur="4.65">chronic disease with autoimmune and</text><text start="370.509" dur="4.77">neuro degenerate capacity and their</text><text start="373.569" dur="3.87">emotional status is always affected and</text><text start="375.279" dur="3.57">its affected in ways that have to be</text><text start="377.439" dur="2.7">supported for them to be able to do what</text><text start="378.849" dur="4.021">it takes to actually do the rest of the</text><text start="380.139" dur="4.471">treatments to have the focused drive etc</text><text start="382.87" dur="3.9">to do generally a meaningful amount of</text><text start="384.61" dur="5.16">work and so that&apos;s what really kind of</text><text start="386.77" dur="4.669">led into an integrative approach to the</text><text start="389.77" dur="4.429">future of psychopharmacology</text><text start="391.439" dur="5.741">psychoneuroimmunology psychiatry and</text><text start="394.199" dur="5.59">then starting to look at not just</text><text start="397.18" dur="4.349">addressing issues to come up to baseline</text><text start="399.789" dur="3.81">but also we end</text><text start="401.529" dur="4.32">and Space Lab so this is kind of the</text><text start="403.599" dur="4.83">intersection with biologic transhumanism</text><text start="405.849" dur="5.52">can we do fundamental bio optimization</text><text start="408.429" dur="4.53">and that then intersected with the other</text><text start="411.369" dur="3.27">thing tank work I had been doing while I</text><text start="412.959" dur="4.38">was working complex systems which is how</text><text start="414.639" dur="4.29">do we support the major transitions and</text><text start="417.339" dur="3.15">civilization writ large that

dur="3.81">addressing and there&apos;s economic shifts</text><text start="425.799" dur="2.55">there&apos;s governance shift there&apos;s</text><text start="426.819" dur="2.94">infrastructure technology shifts that</text><text start="428.349" dur="3.39">have to happen but there&apos;s also</text><text start="429.759" dur="4.77">recognizing that all of the major issues</text><text start="431.739" dur="6.48">that were wanting to address are human</text><text start="434.529" dur="5.22">behavior mediated and all of the new</text><text start="438.219" dur="2.97">capacities were wanting to bring about</text><text start="439.749" dur="3.39">are also going to be human behavior</text><text start="441.189" dur="4.16">mediated so then looking at the human</text><text

going to go into a</text><text start="488.289" dur="5.19">meaningful rabbit hole if we do because</text><text start="490.569" dur="5.52">the topic of human nature versus that</text><text

dur="4.41">want your body to be able to up regulate</text><text start="1963.07" dur="5.31">so one thing is rather than give someone</text><text start="1965.71" dur="4.62">a dopamine agonist that is

dur="4.2">phenylalanine it gets converted to</text><text start="1999.22" dur="4.29">tyrosine it gets converted to acetyl</text><text start="2001.38" dur="3.429">tyrosine it gets converted to l-dopa it</text><text start="2003.51" dur="3.399">gets converted to dopamine</text><text start="2004.809" dur="4.32">it has to travel a process and apps</text><text start="2006.909" dur="2.821">where it&apos;s broken down by chemicals like</text><text start="2009.129" dur="2.971">mao-b</text><text start="2009.73" dur="4.319">and then it has to get up taken and the</text><text start="2012.1" dur="4.59">postsynaptic dopamine receptors and</text><text start="2014.049" dur="4.291">there&apos;s differential up taking the d1 d2</text><text start="2016.69" dur="4.859">d3 receptors that affect

they</text><text start="2040.96" dur="4.14">hydroxide these are all gonna lead to</text><text start="2042.909" dur="5.571">imbalances in their own regulatory</text><text start="2045.1" dur="5.819">systems so we were looking at common</text><text start="2048.48" dur="3.79">regulatory difficulties and how to be</text><text start="2050.919" dur="4.321">able to support the systems have</text><text start="2052.27" dur="5.01">increased regulatory robustness and so</text><text start="2055.24" dur="4.95">therefore you&apos;re less likely to see grow</text><text start="2057.28" dur="4.92">side effects yeah right so think about</text><text start="2060.19" dur="5.879">you know when I when I was talking about</text><text start="2062.2" dur="6.119">the amino acids the vitamins and</text><text start="2066.069" dur="5.01">minerals were necessary as cofactors</text><text start="2068.319" dur="4.29">plus the synaptic transmission plus the</text><text start="2071.079" dur="3.961">receptor site modulation we&apos;re looking</text><text start="2072.609" dur="3.99">at multiple steps across a whole pathway</text><text start="2075.04" dur="4.369">and we&apos;re seeing where the rate limiting</text><text start="2076.599" dur="5.611">effects and how can we support those and</text><text start="2079.409" dur="5.44">but then that&apos;s just opening right and</text><text start="2082.21" dur="4.5">so increased concentration without</text><text start="2084.849" dur="4.171">increased working memory ends up being</text><text start="2086.71" dur="4.199">pretty lame and so increased working</text><text start="2089.02" dur="4.139">memory is mostly not dopamine lot</text><text start="2090.909" dur="3.901">supported right it&apos;s mostly mediated by</text><text start="2093.159" dur="4.591">acetylcholine and other transmitters</text><text start="2094.81" dur="4.47">and the compte yeah well so that now</text><text start="2097.75" dur="3.63">we&apos;re looking at enzymes again right</text><text start="2099.28" dur="4.47">yeah and so if we&apos;re wanting to increase</text><text start="2101.38" dur="4.92">short-term and long-term and working</text><text start="2103.75" dur="4.65">memory and intensity of focusing on</text><text start="2106.3" dur="4.68">concentration but also the capacity for</text><text start="2108.4" dur="4.199">task switching well it was we kind of</text><text start="2110.98" dur="2.73">modeled from a cognitive science</text><text start="2112.599" dur="3.331">perspective what are all the things</text><text start="2113.71" dur="4.58">we&apos;re wanting to affect or what people</text><text start="2115.93" dur="4.29">call the synergy of those things are</text><text start="2118.29" dur="5.17">cognitively available creative</text><text start="2120.22" dur="5.31">productive flow states of that what are</text><text start="2123.46" dur="4.35">the underlying physiological pathways</text><text start="2125.53" dur="3.93">that mediate those and then how do we</text><text start="2127.81" dur="3.029">support those pathways then let&apos;s look</text><text start="2129.46" dur="4.109">at synergies between them</text><text start="2130.839" dur="4.831">sounds like a fair approach well I do</text><text start="2133.569" dur="4.981">wonder though okay so in listening to</text><text start="2135.67" dur="4.29">this could be like well like how</text><text start="2138.55" dur="4.05">you why are you why do you have so much</text><text start="2139.96" dur="4.5">confidence you were not formally trained</text><text start="2142.6" dur="3.99">you&apos;re not you could imagine a doctor</text><text start="2144.46" dur="4.86">listening to this and and just</text><text start="2146.59" dur="4.32">immediately dismissing this whole thing</text><text start="2149.32" dur="4.47">is saying well look I&apos;m not even gonna</text><text start="2150.91" dur="5.37">listen to this because he didn&apos;t even go</text><text start="2153.79" dur="3.63">through med school what do you say that</text><text start="2156.28" dur="3.0">you know so I was like like why are you</text><text start="2157.42" dur="5.67">so confident in what you&apos;re saying well</text><text start="2159.28" dur="6.62">having a lot of respect for what we</text><text start="2163.09" dur="4.71">consider better methods of</text><text start="2165.9" dur="4.36">interdisciplinary education and</text><text start="2167.8" dur="4.2">traditional specialist education usually</text><text start="2170.26" dur="3.57">does we also have a lot of respect for</text><text start="2172.0" dur="3.84">people that the cutting edge of their</text><text start="2173.83" dur="4.08">specialties that formally trained in it</text><text start="2175.84" dur="4.44">so you know this wasn&apos;t developed in</text><text start="2177.91" dur="4.26">isolation this development was working</text><text start="2180.28" dur="3.84">with many doctors were working and</text><text start="2182.17" dur="3.72">integrated facilities running pre and</text><text start="2184.12" dur="3.3">post blood labs and we actually started</text><text start="2185.89" dur="3.26">with you know having some medical</text><text start="2187.42" dur="3.54">directors I want to play with us and</text><text start="2189.15" dur="3.1">particularly with patients they&apos;re</text><text start="2190.96" dur="3.45">having a hard time with him he said we</text><text start="2192.25" dur="3.0">show again risk-benefit made sense to</text><text start="2194.41" dur="3.0">them because they were having a hard</text><text start="2195.25" dur="5.13">time they said we think we&apos;ve got an</text><text start="2197.41" dur="5.04">approach that could help and so we were</text><text start="2200.38" dur="3.9">customizing chemistry based on looking</text><text start="2202.45" dur="4.92">at their genome their clinical chemistry</text><text start="2204.28" dur="5.22">their clinical intake etc and then</text><text start="2207.37" dur="3.72">getting to see really profound shift not</text><text start="2209.5" dur="3.99">just in subjective reporting but in</text><text start="2211.09" dur="4.83">those same biometrics being tested again</text><text start="2213.49" dur="3.75">and so then that that&apos;s actually where</text><text start="2215.92" dur="3.12">we started in the formulation process</text><text start="2217.24" dur="4.29">and then started to say well what things</text><text start="2219.04" dur="5.07">are pretty common across most people who</text><text start="2221.53" dur="4.26">have similar desires or symptom ology</text><text start="2224.11" dur="3.06">that we could before getting into</text><text start="2225.79" dur="3.27">personalized medicine be able to</text><text start="2227.17" dur="4.71">meaningfully affect at scale so the</text><text start="2229.06" dur="5.16">doctors were contributing to the insight</text><text start="2231.88" dur="4.35">of you know how we did formulation and</text><text start="2234.22" dur="3.51">then we&apos;ve had a number of PhD</text><text start="2236.23" dur="3.0">neuroscientists of different disciplines</text><text start="2237.73" dur="3.54">neural chemists on petition we&apos;re all</text><text start="2239.23" dur="3.96">scientists etc look at what we&apos;re doing</text><text start="2241.27" dur="3.48">give us feedback on at a number of</text><text start="2243.19" dur="5.34">different kinds of doctors psychiatrists</text><text start="2244.75" dur="6.03">and integrative MDS and etc look at it</text><text start="2248.53" dur="4.53">and give us feedback on it many doctors</text><text start="2250.78" dur="4.47">just find what we were doing start using</text><text start="2253.06" dur="4.74">it in their clinics and contact us and</text><text start="2255.25" dur="4.26">saying you know here are the effects</text><text start="2257.8" dur="3.63">were seeing in patients they were very</text><text start="2259.51" dur="4.17">positive so we&apos;re actually just starting</text><text start="2261.43" dur="4.8">to put together a program to kind of</text><text start="2263.68" dur="5.52">like harvest this that or better how we</text><text start="2266.23" dur="5.76">can be distributed science and of course</text><text start="2269.2" dur="3.22">once we came to a place that we felt</text><text start="2271.99" dur="2.53">good</text><text start="2272.42" dur="4.35">our own internal testing on formulation</text><text start="2274.52" dur="5.31">which had many rounds we did a formal</text><text start="2276.77" dur="5.1">safety data sheet we had you know which</text><text start="2279.83" dur="3.75">looked at all of the research meta</text><text start="2281.87" dur="5.33">analysis structured review on all the</text><text start="2283.58" dur="5.79">ingredients and etc and we had</text><text start="2287.2" dur="6.58">pharmacists look at it doctors look at</text><text start="2289.37" dur="5.94">it HD neuro chemists look and I I went</text><text start="2293.78" dur="3.24">through you know I don&apos;t take anything</text><text start="2295.31" dur="4.14">at face value right so I mean I looked</text><text start="2297.02" dur="4.53">every researched every single one of the</text><text start="2299.45" dur="3.54">ingredients and I like spent like a day</text><text start="2301.55" dur="4.43">on each one I was like because that</text><text start="2302.99" dur="5.58">one&apos;s very potent it&apos;s very potent so</text><text start="2305.98" dur="4.51">racetam starting with piracetam in them</text><text start="2308.57" dur="4.32">there&apos;s many other racetam zener asset</text><text start="2310.49" dur="4.62">an impressive them do different things</text><text start="2312.89" dur="4.74">but their primary effect is up</text><text start="2315.11" dur="5.79">regulating acetylcholine uptake in the</text><text start="2317.63" dur="6.03">nmda complex so they&apos;re learning helps</text><text start="2320.9"

most people would not want that</text><text start="2649.21" dur="3.78">because they want to the will is</text><text start="2651.82" dur="3.48">something about the human will about</text><text start="2652.99" dur="5.93">suffering and overcoming suffering that</text><text start="2655.3" dur="6.6">makes us human that makes us want to</text><text start="2658.92" dur="5.56">gives us a sense of meaning in life</text><text start="2661.9" dur="4.83">ultimately the kind of vision you have</text><text start="2664.48" dur="4.23">for this world at which I share and I</text><text start="2666.73" dur="5.7">and I think is really quite admirable</text><text start="2668.71" dur="4.92">we&apos;ll have to go beyond nootropics right</text><text start="2672.43" dur="4.909">I mean it&apos;s only part</text><text start="2673.63" dur="6.27">the whole system of cultural changes of</text><text start="2677.339" dur="3.881">personal changes as well that is willed</text><text start="2679.9" dur="4.53">right yet</text><text start="2681.22" dur="5.129">so let&apos;s just roughly break down four</text><text start="2684.43" dur="3.96">categories that we can look at this in</text><text start="2686.349" dur="3.841">terms of that are not reducible to each</text><text start="2688.39" dur="3.51">other but are all under effect sounds</text><text start="2690.19" dur="5.399">good let&apos;s think about human physiology</text><text start="2691.9" dur="5.429">which includes our you know EEG pattern</text><text start="2695.589" dur="3.51">computational neuroscience stuff our</text><text start="2697.329" dur="3.93">neural chemistry or endocrinology the</text><text start="2699.099" dur="4.081">our microbiome genetic expression just</text><text start="2701.259" dur="3.721">all of the things that affect what you</text><text start="2703.18" dur="4.32">can think of as the human Hardware so</text><text start="2704.98" dur="5.43">there are human Hardware predispositions</text><text start="2707.5" dur="4.74">for I mean if you just think about</text><text start="2710.41" dur="4.53">consciousness running on that Hardware</text><text start="2712.24" dur="4.619">then then empathy runs on certain neural</text><text start="2714.94" dur="4.169">networks utilize utilizing certain</text><text start="2716.859" dur="4.531">neural chemistry etc that can be up or</text><text start="2719.109" dur="5.551">down legged it can be down regulated by</text><text start="2721.39" dur="5.58">head trauma by microbiome imbalances by</text><text start="2724.66" dur="4.5">toxicity can also be operated by a</text><text start="2726.97" dur="4.41">number of things so let&apos;s think about</text><text start="2729.16" dur="4.53">the human Hardware predispositions and</text><text start="2731.38" dur="5.55">capacities let&apos;s think about human</text><text start="2733.69" dur="5.46">software being our value systems or</text><text start="2736.93" dur="4.439">world view or understanding themselves</text><text start="2739.15" dur="4.77">or understanding of other right now</text><text start="2741.369" dur="4.291">they&apos;re they&apos;re not hardware software as</text><text start="2743.92" dur="3.48">totally distinct categories like they</text><text start="2745.66" dur="3.959">are in computers because of course they</text><text start="2747.4" dur="5.1">are dynamically intersecting each other</text><text start="2749.619" dur="4.65">continuously in real time that&apos;s means</text><text start="2752.5" dur="3.24">that the neural plasticity where your</text><text start="2754.269" dur="2.971">thoughts are affecting physiology and</text><text start="2755.74" dur="4.92">your physiologist predisposing thoughts</text><text start="2757.24" dur="5.67">it is a it is a completely intimate link</text><text start="2760.66" dur="4.139">between them but we can so roughly think</text><text start="2762.91" dur="4.08">of those categories so on the software</text><text start="2764.799" dur="3.451">side we have education we have media we</text><text start="2766.99" dur="4.319">have psychology with personal</text><text start="2768.25" dur="5.16">development psychotherapy etc on the</text><text start="2771.309" dur="3.51">hardware side we have not just medicine</text><text start="2773.41" dur="3.33">but the future of well-being</text><text start="2774.819" dur="3.75">optimization and those are both at the</text><text start="2776.74" dur="3.569">level of the individual then at the</text><text start="2778.569" dur="3.75">level of beyond the intuitive level of</text><text start="2780.309" dur="3.901">the collective kind of the hardware of</text><text start="2782.319" dur="3.601">the collective is infrastructure how we</text><text start="2784.21" dur="3.839">meet our physical needs in relation to</text><text start="2785.92" dur="3.81">the planet water energy agriculture</text><text start="2788.049" dur="4.23">transportation in factoring waste</text><text start="2789.73" dur="4.319">management and then the software the</text><text start="2792.279" dur="5.01">collective is the agreement fields that</text><text start="2794.049" dur="4.71">run over that is social structures</text><text start="2797.289" dur="5.07">economics governance</text><text start="2798.759" dur="6.0">language ultimately the hardware and</text><text start="2802.359" dur="5.21">software of the individual and the</text><text start="2804.759" dur="4.7">collective all have to be upgraded and</text><text start="2807.569" dur="4.5">for this kind of phase shift that</text><text start="2809.459" dur="6.84">humanity is entering into and upgraded</text><text start="2812.069" dur="6.331">towards Omni positivity meaning that</text><text start="2816.299" dur="3.9">each of those four have things that</text><text start="2818.4" dur="3.78">affect human experience in human</text><text start="2820.199" dur="3.66">behavior the environment right the</text><text start="2822.18" dur="2.669">lower-right infrastructure that the</text><text start="2823.859" dur="2.67">build world and natural world</text><text start="2824.849" dur="3.571">environment affect you can experience</text><text start="2826.529" dur="3.84">and affect your behavior so do the</text><text start="2828.42" dur="3.96">social agreement fields culture</text><text start="2830.369" dur="4.14">economics etcetera economics what we</text><text start="2832.38" dur="4.56">incentivize very directly affection</text><text start="2834.509" dur="4.621">behavior what we have status of</text><text start="2836.94" dur="4.109">allocated to etc our definition of</text><text start="2839.13" dur="4.199">success in the individual and human</text><text start="2841.049" dur="4.23">software and our physiology so we would</text><text start="2843.329" dur="3.601">say no topics are just the first part</text><text start="2845.279" dur="5.46">we&apos;re getting into of human physiology</text><text start="2846.93" dur="6.359">which is just one of these areas and all</text><text start="2850.739" dur="5.191">of them are necessary but only all of</text><text start="2853.289" dur="4.83">them together makes efficient yeah I</text><text start="2855.93" dur="4.289">appreciate you outlining those for that</text><text start="2858.119" dur="3.9">topology there are heart there are</text><text start="2860.219" dur="4.08">things we can do software wise that can</text><text start="2862.019" dur="3.871">show the same effects on phy ology and</text><text start="2864.299" dur="4.141">physiology as the nootropics</text><text start="2865.89" dur="4.709">in some case like meditation can get you</text><text start="2868.44" dur="4.769">in a state of mind it&apos;s so there&apos;s</text><text start="2870.599" dur="4.531">different routes perhaps to this upgrade</text><text start="2873.209" dur="3.181">there&apos;s not just a single route and</text><text start="2875.13" dur="3.75">there are multiple routes that can get</text><text start="2876.39" dur="4.409">you the same place perhaps some time</text><text start="2878.88" dur="4.139">same place and sometimes different but</text><text start="2880.799" dur="4.621">related but highly synergistic places</text><text start="2883.019" dur="4.23">when they come oh sure yeah for sure and</text><text start="2885.42" dur="3.779">that&apos;s the beauty of self-organizing</text><text start="2887.249" dur="3.75">systems and I mean that&apos;s the whole</text><text start="2889.199" dur="2.941">point of systems right is that you want</text><text start="2890.999" dur="3.57">to get to a point where they&apos;re all</text><text start="2892.14" dur="4.229">integrated and that the entropy is</text><text start="2894.569" dur="3.811">minimized we were just talking about</text><text start="2896.369" dur="5.46">whole systems and self-organization yeah</text><text start="2898.38" dur="5.159">and by understanding how whole systems</text><text start="2901.829" dur="3.72">works leads to a perspective that</text><text start="2903.539" dur="4.111">emphasizes synthesis of all of the</text><text start="2905.549" dur="3.78">meaningful modalities one of the</text><text start="2907.65" dur="4.799">concepts that we have to get over that</text><text start="2909.329" dur="5.28">is kind of reductionism in the negative</text><text start="2912.449" dur="3.87">sense rather than positive as the word</text><text start="2914.609" dur="3.66">is kind of looking for single bullet</text><text start="2916.319" dur="3.48">silver bullet solutions you know a</text><text start="2918.269" dur="3.03">single molecule that&apos;s going to fix this</text><text start="2919.799" dur="3.27">whole thing well it wasn&apos;t a single</text><text start="2921.299" dur="3.48">molecule that was off there was a whole</text><text start="2923.069" dur="5.071">cascade of systemic effects that were</text><text start="2924.779" dur="4.861">off and so is it human hardware or is it</text><text start="2928.14" dur="4.109">human software or is it the environment</text><text start="2929.64" dur="4.589">or well it&apos;s usually all items some kind</text><text start="2932.249" dur="4.29">of complex so the question becomes if</text><text start="2934.229" dur="4.171">someone&apos;s physiology is off how to</text><text start="2936.539" dur="3.66">balance it can lead to their psychology</text><text start="2938.4" dur="2.38">being out of balance which can lead to</text><text start="2940.199" dur="1.961">their physical</text><text start="2940.78" dur="3.63">make more at once and you get a vicious</text><text start="2942.16" dur="4.23">cycle you can also get virtuous cycles</text><text start="2944.41" dur="3.9">of creating lift and meb areas making it</text><text start="2946.39" dur="3.96">easier for better behavior and function</text><text start="2948.31" dur="4.29">in those areas creating more lift so our</text><text start="2950.35" dur="4.02">interest is how do we stop negative</text><text start="2952.6" dur="4.08">feedback cycles and how do we promote</text><text start="2954.37" dur="5.07">virtuous cycles positive feedback cycles</text><text start="2956.68" dur="4.44">between by the mind relationship</text><text start="2959.44" dur="3.9">environment right between all of those</text><text start="2961.12" dur="5.25">intersecting complexes and how do we</text><text start="2963.34" dur="5.01">meaningfully synthesize and support all</text><text start="2966.37" dur="3.9">of the modalities are actually effective</text><text start="2968.35" dur="4.86">no that sounds like a great goal I mean</text><text start="2970.27" dur="5.16">you have our thoughts you know like</text><text start="2973.21" dur="3.63">cognitive behavioral therapy effects do</text><text start="2975.43" dur="2.61">the way we frame things don&apos;t way we</text><text start="2976.84" dur="3.39">make meaning out of our experiences</text><text start="2978.04" dur="4.35">effects our cortisol production it</text><text start="2980.23" dur="4.53">affects you know our negative reactions</text><text start="2982.39" dur="4.32">so we it in all these different
