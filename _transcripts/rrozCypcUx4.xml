dur="4.231">our topic is neuro hacking or the</text><text start="41.37" dur="3.77">voluntary altering of your own brain</text><text start="43.29" dur="4.199">function to optimize for performance</text><text start="45.14" dur="5.5">well-being or a number of other factors</text><text start="47.489" dur="5.581">and we recently got our hands on qualia</text><text start="50.64" dur="4.59">which is a newer enhancer or a smart</text><text start="53.07" dur="4.5">drug stack from neuro hacker collective</text><text start="55.23" dur="4.349">which Daniel is the co-founder of we&apos;ve</text><text start="57.57" dur="5.129">tried a few other smart drugs before</text><text start="59.579" dur="4.951">like modafinil for example but qualia</text><text start="62.699" dur="4.081">seems to be quite different from the</text><text start="64.53" dur="4.29">others for example my experience of</text><text start="66.78" dur="4.32">Madeleine was that it made me just</text><text start="68.82" dur="4.83">dislike people in general although it</text><text start="71.1" dur="4.29">made me extremely focused but qualia</text><text start="73.65" dur="4.44">didn&apos;t have any of those side effects</text><text start="75.39" dur="4.92">for me it gave me a sense of emotional</text><text start="78.09" dur="4.529">well-being and a general sense of</text><text start="80.31" dur="4.53">balance as well as focus which was quite</text><text start="82.619" dur="4.771">interesting the term for this is broad</text><text start="84.84" dur="4.95">spectrum cognitive enhancement which</text><text start="87.39" dur="4.38">means that it doesn&apos;t just improve one</text><text start="89.79" dur="4.17">quality of your functioning but

dur="4.5">talked about quite a different set of</text><text start="234.27" dur="4.29">subjects and today we&apos;d like to talk</text><text start="236.55" dur="3.39">with you about neuro hacking so maybe</text><text start="238.56" dur="3.36">can you give us like a brief</text><text start="239.94" dur="3.75">introduction to what neuro hacking is</text><text start="241.92" dur="4.11">and why we should be doing it if we</text><text start="243.69" dur="5.01">should be doing it yeah so neuro hacking</text><text start="246.03" dur="4.8">is a broad and kind of ambiguous term</text><text start="248.7" dur="4.259">related to bio hacking and consciousness</text><text start="250.83" dur="3.6">hacking generally we can think of it as</text><text start="252.959" dur="4.161">the application of any tools or</text><text start="254.43" dur="5.429">technologies or processes to modulate</text><text start="257.12" dur="5.04">augment upgrade some aspect of</text><text start="259.859" dur="5.881">psychological neurological function and</text><text start="262.16" dur="5.53">so we could think of ancient neural</text><text start="265.74" dur="3.93">hacking technologies being</text><text start="267.69" dur="4.26">meditation and sweat lodges and</text><text start="269.67" dur="3.96">psychedelics and dancing around the</text><text start="271.95" dur="5.67">campfire to get into trance-like states</text><text start="273.63" dur="5.85">and etc and obviously with advances in</text><text start="277.62" dur="5.97">neuroscience and neuro technology we&apos;ve</text><text start="279.48" dur="5.97">got Q EEG neurofeedback we&apos;ve got</text><text start="283.59" dur="4.17">transcranial stimulation technologies</text><text start="285.45" dur="4.8">we&apos;ve got much more advanced microbiome</text><text start="287.76" dur="5.1">ik genomic you know biochemical</text><text start="290.25" dur="6.63">technologies so we can think of neuro</text><text start="292.86" dur="6.3">hacking as how do we optimize the mind</text><text start="296.88" dur="5.1">brain interface towards any positive</text><text start="299.16" dur="5.25">purpose utilizing whatever tools best</text><text start="301.98" dur="5.1">serve that particular purpose I love how</text><text start="304.41" dur="5.94">you say mind brain interface as if there</text><text start="307.08" dur="4.82">are very separate things well the reason</text><text start="310.35" dur="4.59">that we&apos;re saying mind brain interface</text><text start="311.9" dur="8.11">together is because if you want to run</text><text start="314.94" dur="7.02">the analogy of mind stuff as kind of</text><text start="320.01" dur="3.93">like software and brain stuff is kind of</text><text start="321.96" dur="4.23">like hardware you realize that the</text><text start="323.94" dur="4.17">distinction the clear distinction in</text><text start="326.19" dur="3.99">computers between software and hardware</text><text start="328.11" dur="5.79">we don&apos;t have such a clear distinction</text><text start="330.18" dur="6.96">and the human organism that any change</text><text start="333.9" dur="4.65">in thought has a physical change in the</text><text start="337.14" dur="3.24">brain that&apos;s happening any physical</text><text start="338.55" dur="5.49">change in the brain has some change in</text><text start="340.38" dur="7.05">thinking emotion experience etc and so</text><text start="344.04" dur="4.32">they are dynamically Co inter affecting</text><text start="347.43" dur="3.36">each other all the time</text><text start="348.36" dur="5.309">so I suppose a lot of the thinking that</text><text start="350.79" dur="5.04">we&apos;ve done about consciousness has come</text><text start="353.669" dur="3.811">from well it&apos;s come from a lot of</text><text start="355.83" dur="4.26">different perspectives but the one that</text><text start="357.48" dur="4.05">we land on quite often is the</text><text start="360.09" dur="3.96">perspective from Hinduism and Buddhism</text><text start="361.53" dur="5.04">which is you are not the mind and the</text><text start="364.05" dur="5.52">consciousness is not exactly localized</text><text start="366.57" dur="4.32">in physical material in the brain so do</text><text start="369.57" dur="2.88">you have much to say from that</text><text start="370.89" dur="4.44">perspective before we dive deeper into</text><text start="372.45" dur="4.83">neuro hacking yeah so we get right into</text><text start="375.33" dur="3.51">what&apos;s what&apos;s famously known in</text><text start="377.28" dur="4.94">neuroscience as the hard problem of</text><text start="378.84" dur="5.85">neuroscience how does consciousness and</text><text start="382.22" dur="4.57">brain right or in general consciousness</text><text start="384.69" dur="5.33">and physics how do they what are they</text><text start="386.79" dur="5.46">both and how do they relate and is there</text><text start="390.02" dur="5.2">causal interaction in both directions</text><text start="392.25" dur="4.68">this is the hard problem of neuroscience</text><text start="395.22" dur="4.08">but before that this was you know the</text><text start="396.93" dur="3.44">kind of hard problem with the mind brain</text><text start="399.3" dur="2.96">problem where the</text><text start="400.37" dur="4.26">the dualism challenge that all</text><text start="402.26" dur="4.8">philosophic systems faced is it seems</text><text start="404.63" dur="5.31">like there is third-person stuff right</text><text start="407.06" dur="6.359">that we can all independently measure in</text><text start="409.94" dur="5.699">Sciences the method of knowing the third</text><text start="413.419" dur="4.081">person reality we&apos;ll think of as third</text><text start="415.639" dur="4.291">person or objective reality we can all</text><text start="417.5" dur="5.28">measure it we can corroborate it and if</text><text start="419.93" dur="4.799">we&apos;re going to you know make hypotheses</text><text start="422.78" dur="4.68">about interactional dynamics we&apos;ll be</text><text start="424.729" dur="6.061">able to you know make predictions etc</text><text start="427.46" dur="6.66">and third person stuff has weight and</text><text start="430.79" dur="5.9">position and charge and length and spin</text><text start="434.12" dur="5.7">and those kinds of properties</text><text start="436.69" dur="5.979">first-person stuff doesn&apos;t have any of</text><text start="439.82" dur="6.21">those right it has emotion and feeling</text><text start="442.669" dur="4.771">and longing and impulse and it can&apos;t be</text><text start="446.03" dur="3.93">corroborated by anybody else at all</text><text start="447.44" dur="5.099">right like you are having a first-person</text><text start="449.96" dur="5.07">experience as we&apos;re talking and I can</text><text start="452.539" dur="4.711">empathetically imagine to feel into what</text><text start="455.03" dur="3.509">your experience is like but that is</text><text start="457.25" dur="3.8">different than actually having the</text><text start="458.539" dur="6.481">first-person access to it that you do so</text><text start="461.05" dur="5.92">there both of these realities exist has</text><text start="465.02" dur="3.66">been acknowledged and there are</text><text start="466.97" dur="3.72">philosophic systems that don&apos;t think</text><text start="468.68" dur="4.2">that they&apos;re both real right you have</text><text start="470.69" dur="3.93">what are called idealism systems that</text><text start="472.88" dur="2.849">say consciousness is fundamentally real</text><text start="474.62" dur="3.66">because it&apos;s the only thing we can know</text><text start="475.729" dur="3.69">I can know that I&apos;m having an experience</text><text start="478.28" dur="3.18">but I can&apos;t know that what I&apos;m</text><text start="479.419" dur="3.541">experiencing about the world even</text><text start="481.46" dur="2.94">through my scientific measurements is</text><text start="482.96" dur="2.97">true because I could just be a crazy</text><text start="484.4" dur="4.38">person right this could all be a dream</text><text start="485.93" dur="5.63">it could all be the matrix and it could</text><text start="488.78" dur="5.46">just be you know contours within</text><text start="491.56" dur="4.99">consciousness but I don&apos;t I only have</text><text start="494.24" dur="5.64">first-person experience first-person</text><text start="496.55" dur="6.48">access to my experience of stuff not the</text><text start="499.88" dur="4.89">stuff itself and so in those models</text><text start="503.03" dur="4.29">what&apos;s fundamentally reals consciousness</text><text start="504.77" dur="4.38">and the rest of universe right</text><text start="507.32" dur="4.65">third-person self is either not real at</text><text start="509.15" dur="4.759">all Maya or it&apos;s an epiphenomena of</text><text start="511.97" dur="5.819">consciousness mind creates reality</text><text start="513.909" dur="5.711">you&apos;ve got the other side and says which</text><text start="517.789" dur="4.471">fundamentally real is physical stuff</text><text start="519.62" dur="4.98">material stuff physical stuff happened</text><text start="522.26" dur="4.17">with the Big Bang interactions occur</text><text start="524.6" dur="3.33">that lead to complexity emergent</text><text start="526.43" dur="4.2">properties have enough complexity and</text><text start="527.93" dur="4.47">somewhere around biology or maybe</text><text start="530.63" dur="3.39">nervous systems consciousness is an</text><text start="532.4" dur="4.1">emergent property but what</text><text start="534.02" dur="5.4">fundamentally real is physical stuff and</text><text start="536.5" dur="3.79">then consciousness is either just not</text><text start="539.42" dur="3.15">real at all</text><text start="540.29" dur="3.75">it&apos;s called radical diminutive ism so</text><text start="542.57" dur="4.25">Dan Dennett and others kind of proposed</text><text start="544.04" dur="5.97">that it&apos;s kind of like an illusion or</text><text start="546.82" dur="5.65">consciousness is real but it&apos;s an</text><text start="550.01" dur="5.37">epiphenomena of complex neural networks</text><text start="552.47" dur="5.34">right radical emergentism so you&apos;ve got</text><text start="555.38" dur="4.86">different philosophic systems that don&apos;t</text><text start="557.81" dur="5.43">see both of those has fundamentally real</text><text start="560.24" dur="5.64">things or reduce them to the domain that</text><text start="563.24" dur="4.23">seems more role to them or they&apos;re stuck</text><text start="565.88" dur="3.18">with all right these both seem real and</text><text start="567.47" dur="4.56">they seem uncommon surrett called</text><text start="569.06" dur="6.95">dualism or attempts to try and reconcile</text><text start="572.03" dur="7.04">them more deeply and so when you&apos;re</text><text start="576.01" dur="5.86">living your life when your body is</text><text start="579.07" dur="4.3">touched interacted with sensation</text><text start="581.87" dur="3.57">happens this is physical right it&apos;s</text><text start="583.37" dur="3.99">being mediated by via biology and</text><text start="585.44" dur="4.86">physics and yet you have a conscious</text><text start="587.36" dur="4.65">experience so it seems like physics can</text><text start="590.3" dur="4.47">affect consciousness there&apos;s a causal</text><text start="592.01" dur="5.94">movement but you also experience</text><text start="594.77" dur="5.52">yourself having some choice and again we</text><text start="597.95" dur="4.02">get deep into not just the topic of</text><text start="600.29" dur="4.29">consciousness with the topic of will and</text><text start="601.97" dur="4.26">volition and if your choice is real and</text><text start="604.58" dur="4.17">then affects your hand moving it would</text><text start="606.23" dur="6.14">seem that consciousness has some effect</text><text start="608.75" dur="5.82">on physics and there for every branch</text><text start="612.37" dur="4.27">where you say well what about that and</text><text start="614.57" dur="3.27">each of these questions each of these</text><text start="616.64" dur="3.06">things I&apos;ve said and the questions that</text><text start="617.84" dur="3.96">come up there is a whole branch of</text><text start="619.7" dur="4.17">philosophy that goes down is there</text><text start="621.8" dur="3.93">really free will or not is it compatible</text><text start="623.87" dur="5.19">with the deterministic universe or not</text><text start="625.73" dur="4.68">is universe deterministic etc but most</text><text start="629.06" dur="3.78">of what we&apos;re gonna talk about today</text><text start="630.41" dur="6.74">does not require these deep existential</text><text start="632.84" dur="7.8">issues being solved to say that we do</text><text start="637.15" dur="6.46">know empirically both first-person and</text><text start="640.64" dur="5.16">third-person the things that we can do</text><text start="643.61" dur="6.18">with our subjective experience so</text><text start="645.8" dur="6.12">mindfulness meditation introspection etc</text><text start="649.79" dur="3.92">can actively affect the brain and affect</text><text start="651.92" dur="4.32">the brain in ways that affect the minds</text><text start="653.71" dur="5.05">predispositions and things that we can</text><text start="656.24" dur="4.41">do to the body ie changing its</text><text start="658.76" dur="5.4">biochemistry changing its microbiota</text><text start="660.65" dur="6.48">exercising differently change cognitive</text><text start="664.16" dur="3.75">and emotional right mental and and the</text><text start="667.13" dur="3.42">experience</text><text start="667.91" dur="5.4">of the conscious creature and you can</text><text start="670.55" dur="5.31">abstract and say well okay so you&apos;re</text><text start="673.31" dur="3.69">saying the mind thinking feeling stuff</text><text start="675.86" dur="2.94">is different than the body is</text><text start="677.0" dur="4.68">consciousness different than that as the</text><text start="678.8" dur="7.11">as the non-dual witness imagem candidate</text><text start="681.68" dur="6.87">in new buddhist philosophy so maybe</text><text start="685.91" dur="4.56">there is consciousness as a field effect</text><text start="688.55" dur="4.53">it is then interacting with this</text><text start="690.47" dur="4.23">self-organizing system fascinating</text><text start="693.08" dur="4.17">questions and if you wanted to do a show</text><text start="694.7" dur="4.8">where we just dive into them existential</text><text start="697.25" dur="3.54">questions at depth that behaves I think</text><text start="699.5" dur="4.59">that&apos;s the plan for the next one</text><text start="700.79" dur="6.03">actually but yeah you bring up non non</text><text start="704.09" dur="4.71">duality and that&apos;s exactly what I was</text><text start="706.82" dur="3.66">going to say just now do you approach</text><text start="708.8" dur="4.2">newer hacking from a non-dualistic</text><text start="710.48" dur="4.86">perspective where it&apos;s both ascending</text><text start="713.0" dur="5.25">and descending in terms that Ken Wilber</text><text start="715.34" dur="5.18">uses yeah so when Ken talks about the</text><text start="718.25" dur="4.26">ascending pass he&apos;s talking about the</text><text start="720.52" dur="3.91">transcendent direction and the</text><text start="722.51" dur="4.83">descending paths the eminent direction</text><text start="724.43" dur="7.59">right so the transcendent spiritual</text><text start="727.34" dur="8.61">processes are around in some way having</text><text start="732.02" dur="10.02">consciousness leave body mind etc and go</text><text start="735.95" dur="7.94">into higher states of consciousness etc</text><text start="742.04" dur="4.44">the descending pass around taking</text><text start="743.89" dur="5.05">universal consciousness and embodying it</text><text start="746.48" dur="5.19">more fully and if you just want to talk</text><text start="748.94" dur="5.58">about it very simply in terms of just</text><text start="751.67" dur="5.16">having expanded states of awareness and</text><text start="754.52" dur="5.87">then being able to integrate those</text><text start="756.83" dur="6.78">expanded states as integrated stages yes</text><text start="760.39" dur="5.59">that&apos;s a valuable way to think about it</text><text start="763.61" dur="4.56">cool so why don&apos;t we move into the</text><text start="765.98" dur="4.26">actual subject of neuro hacking you</text><text start="768.17" dur="5.01">talked about the different tools that we</text><text start="770.24" dur="5.52">can use what are some of the currently</text><text start="773.18" dur="3.66">available tools for neuro hacking well</text><text start="775.76" dur="3.8">so there&apos;s a lot of different goals</text><text start="776.84" dur="6.3">right and so if someone&apos;s wanting to</text><text start="779.56" dur="5.77">decrease anxiety or brighten their mood</text><text start="783.14" dur="4.47">or increase their cognitive function or</text><text start="785.33" dur="5.34">have altered kind of you know</text><text start="787.61" dur="5.07">psychedelic numinous states or improve</text><text start="790.67" dur="3.78">their sleep quality or each of these</text><text start="792.68" dur="3.99">goals are gonna have different tools</text><text start="794.45" dur="3.87">that are more appropriate and then each</text><text start="796.67" dur="2.94">of the goals are going to have different</text><text start="798.32" dur="2.65">tools that are different depending up on</text><text start="799.61" dur="3.82">the person and what the person</text><text start="800.97" dur="6.659">she has going on they are specific</text><text start="803.43" dur="6.389">biochemistry genomics etc so I&apos;ll speak</text><text start="807.629" dur="4.32">broadly about categories of tools that</text><text start="809.819" dur="6.69">are currently available and then we can</text><text start="811.949" dur="9.721">get into applications more so think</text><text start="816.509" dur="6.63">about first affecting the brain and body</text><text start="821.67" dur="2.519">and this is another important</text><text start="823.139" dur="2.93">distinction so we look at the</text><text start="824.189" dur="4.77">intersection between the mind and brain</text><text start="826.069" dur="4.361">but it&apos;s not just mind and brain it&apos;s</text><text start="828.959" dur="3.69">your conscious experience in your body</text><text start="830.43" dur="4.29">as a whole and then we could say well</text><text start="832.649" dur="3.721">it&apos;s actually the mind brain body</text><text start="834.72" dur="2.969">environment complex because the</text><text start="836.37" dur="3.029">environment and the body are</text><text start="837.689" dur="4.5">intersecting each other inexorably in</text><text start="839.399" dur="5.37">real time so these are embedded complex</text><text start="842.189" dur="4.411">systems but let&apos;s just talk about the</text><text start="844.769" dur="4.471">topic of embodied consciousness and</text><text start="846.6" dur="4.77">conscious experience that is mediated</text><text start="849.24" dur="5.43">beyond just the nervous system in the</text><text start="851.37" dur="5.73">physiology you know the first example</text><text start="854.67" dur="4.469">that I think people are getting pretty</text><text start="857.1" dur="4.589">properly aware of is the gut brain axis</text><text start="859.139" dur="4.44">and the gut brain axis is mediated by</text><text start="861.689" dur="3.51">via a number of things you&apos;ve got the</text><text start="863.579" dur="3.93">enteric nervous system which is a whole</text><text start="865.199" dur="5.07">branch of peripheral nervous system in</text><text start="867.509" dur="5.19">the intestines where inflammation in the</text><text start="870.269" dur="4.771">intestines can cause imbalance between</text><text start="872.699" dur="4.651">sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous</text><text start="875.04" dur="6.08">system can cause more inflammation etc</text><text start="877.35" dur="8.219">but you&apos;ve also got the microbiome</text><text start="881.12" dur="7.089">digesting food and actually many of our</text><text start="885.569" dur="5.911">nutrients are metabolic byproducts of</text><text start="888.209" dur="4.86">the microbiota and obviously we evolved</text><text start="891.48" dur="3.69">with our microbiome over so many</text><text start="893.069" dur="4.08">generations before we had chlorinated</text><text start="895.17" dur="4.709">water and antibiotics and refined sugar</text><text start="897.149" dur="5.04">diets and so the human genome doesn&apos;t</text><text start="899.879" dur="4.08">actually code everything necessary to</text><text start="902.189" dur="3.931">make a human the genome encodes a bunch</text><text start="903.959" dur="5.55">of stuff but we got a genome and a</text><text start="906.12" dur="6.029">microbiome from our parents and the</text><text start="909.509" dur="5.101">babies microbiome comes some in utero</text><text start="912.149" dur="5.101">some from the vaginal flora some from</text><text start="914.61" dur="5.459">you know breastfeeding but if we damage</text><text start="917.25" dur="4.709">that a whole bunch of functions</text><text start="920.069" dur="4.2">necessary to make an optimum human can</text><text start="921.959" dur="3.331">be damaged so specifically regarding</text><text start="924.269" dur="3.031">nervous system</text><text start="925.29" dur="6.06">some of the main neurotransmitters like</text><text start="927.3" dur="6.99">gaba dopamine serotonin are primarily</text><text start="931.35" dur="6.029">produced via flora in the</text><text start="934.29" dur="4.709">and so each of those three I just</text><text start="937.379" dur="3.24">mentioned somewhere between 30 to 80</text><text start="938.999" dur="3.93">percent of those neurotransmitters are</text><text start="940.619" dur="4.05">actually produced in the gut and that</text><text start="942.929" dur="3.84">you know moved to the brain if you think</text><text start="944.669" dur="3.81">about losing 30 to 80 percent of your</text><text start="946.769" dur="5.07">serotonin or GABA or dopamine that</text><text start="948.479" dur="6.0">that&apos;s you know psychopathology right</text><text start="951.839" dur="3.511">that&apos;s that&apos;s a messed up brain so then</text><text start="954.479" dur="4.05">you start looking at well how many</text><text start="955.35" dur="4.739">people are eating food that is feeding</text><text start="958.529" dur="3.48">some microbes more than others and</text><text start="960.089" dur="4.68">changing the gut microbiome or have some</text><text start="962.009" dur="5.49">GI disturbance or and so it&apos;s important</text><text start="964.769" dur="5.34">that if we helped the microbiome of</text><text start="967.499" dur="4.26">someone&apos;s gut that&apos;s a neuro hack right</text><text start="970.109" dur="4.77">we can be changing their brain chemistry</text><text start="971.759" dur="6.66">the most critical kinds of signaling</text><text start="974.879" dur="6.091">chemicals by changing the bacteria in</text><text start="978.419" dur="5.01">their gut the same is true if we want to</text><text start="980.97" dur="5.489">look at say pain anywhere in the body</text><text start="983.429" dur="4.26">pain can create inflammation that can</text><text start="986.459" dur="2.61">cross the blood-brain barrier and cause</text><text start="987.689" dur="4.62">neural

is first order of</text><text start="1012.139" dur="7.62">the body right so tools let&apos;s think</text><text start="1016.339" dur="4.92">about biochemical tools so first line of</text><text start="1019.759" dur="2.7">biochemical tools is things that you can</text><text start="1021.259" dur="3.93">put in your mouth right so we&apos;re talking</text><text start="1022.459" dur="6.98">about vitamins and supplements and herbs</text><text start="1025.189" dur="6.84">and drugs etc so you&apos;ve got anxiety</text><text start="1029.439" dur="5.08">biochemistry things that can

dur="4.23">up</text><text start="1482.49" dur="6.399">it&apos;s interesting how often that ends up</text><text start="1486.07" dur="4.41">being insightful and when we talk about</text><text

isn&apos;t</text><text start="1518.259" dur="5.191">the body already healing at its optimal</text><text start="1519.879" dur="6.66">capacity as it is since it would be</text><text start="1523.45"

isn&apos;t</text><text start="1529.6" dur="6.39">interesting and it&apos;s not even the belief</text><text start="1531.1" dur="7.74">that&apos;s interesting it&apos;s when someone is</text><text

by cortisol and</text><text start="1543.519" dur="5.311">epinephrine and etc and so their</text><text start="1546.159" dur="4.47">cortisol is taking the precursor hormone</text><text start="1548.83" dur="3.54">pregnenolone and shunting it into</text><text start="1550.629" dur="3.481">cortisol in the adrenals which means</text><text start="1552.37" dur="4.019">less of its going to DHEA so the</text><text start="1554.11" dur="5.61">cortisol DHEA ratio gets higher well</text><text start="1556.389" dur="6.51">that ends up affecting everything from</text><text start="1559.72" dur="5.88">genetic transcription to lean muscle</text><text start="1562.899" dur="5.49">mass to bone density to so many things</text><text start="1565.6" dur="5.579">so then when the person believes they&apos;re</text><text start="1568.389" dur="5.49">going to get well and they feel better</text><text start="1571.179" dur="4.531">and their stress drops and their</text><text start="1573.879" dur="3.42">parasympathetic nervous system can kick</text><text start="1575.71" dur="4.02">on they&apos;re sympathetic nervous system</text><text start="1577.299" dur="3.571">chills out and their

dur="5.73">physiology are more available to them</text><text start="1586.09" dur="5.819">and so their body is healing as best as</text><text start="1590.259" dur="3.331">it can in the stress State and in a non</text><text start="1591.909" dur="4.86">stress State that can actually heal</text><text start="1593.59" dur="5.01">better right now one of the interesting</text><text start="1596.769" dur="4.02">things is it&apos;s placebo is not the only</text><text start="1598.6" dur="3.45">thing that can do that you look at work</text><text start="1600.789" dur="4.921">like Norman Cousins were</text><text start="1602.05" dur="5.37">where he just watched comedy because he</text><text start="1605.71" dur="3.27">thought he was dying of cancer and his</text><text start="1607.42" dur="2.85">cancer got better not because he</text><text start="1608.98" dur="3.15">believed he was gonna get better but</text><text start="1610.27" dur="3.99">because he was not stressed out and he</text><text start="1612.13" dur="4.55">was happy for the first time and ended</text><text start="1614.26" dur="6.03">up being that stress was meaningful to</text><text start="1616.68" dur="6.7">you know the process of pathology that</text><text start="1620.29" dur="4.65">was going on for him and so this doesn&apos;t</text><text start="1623.38" dur="2.94">mean that it&apos;s the only thing or that it</text><text start="1624.94" dur="3.03">will always be affecting sometimes</text><text start="1626.32" dur="2.91">placebo just affects how you sense</text><text start="1627.97" dur="3.45">something but not the underlying</text><text start="1629.23" dur="5.1">pathophysiology but it&apos;s a part of it so</text><text start="1631.42" dur="6.6">when you tune into pain in the body for</text><text start="1634.33" dur="5.31">instance or tension in the body is it</text><text start="1638.02" dur="3.51">possible that there is some</text><text start="1639.64" dur="4.74">psychological that&apos;s happening there</text><text start="1641.53" dur="5.88">where you can gain insights Austin are</text><text start="1644.38" dur="5.88">there other ways of affecting cortisol</text><text start="1647.41" dur="5.67">in your body that are meaningful in the</text><text start="1650.26" dur="6.09">long term other than this kind of</text><text start="1653.08" dur="8.21">observing your body and releasing it</text><text start="1656.35" dur="7.29">consciously oh yeah so this is like the</text><text start="1661.29" dur="4.54">first place that functional medicine</text><text start="1663.64" dur="3.93">doctors and naturopathic doctors talk to</text><text start="1665.83" dur="4.64">people which is understanding how the</text><text start="1667.57" dur="5.28">HPA axis works and that the</text><text start="1670.47" dur="5.14">dysregulation and the HPA axis usually</text><text start="1672.85" dur="9.15">starts at the a at the adrenal side and</text><text start="1675.61" dur="9.36">that roughly you can say the sympathetic</text><text start="1682.0" dur="5.4">nervous system innervates the adrenal</text><text start="1684.97" dur="4.68">cortex and the primary hormone there&apos;s</text><text start="1687.4" dur="4.79">many coming from that processes cortisol</text><text start="1689.65" dur="5.22">and the parasympathetic nervous system</text><text start="1692.19" dur="4.63">innervates the adrenal medulla and there</text><text start="1694.87" dur="4.02">are again many hormones that are coming</text><text start="1696.82" dur="5.37">out but the primary one is DHEA so the</text><text start="1698.89" dur="4.59">ratio of cortisol to DHA as hormones in</text><text start="1702.19" dur="3.3">the endocrine system in the blood</text><text start="1703.48" dur="4.26">representing kind of systemic effects is</text><text start="1705.49" dur="4.65">roughly equivalent to the sympathetic</text><text start="1707.74" dur="5.07">parasympathetic ratio of the system as a</text><text start="1710.14" dur="5.79">whole and you know related to chronic</text><text start="1712.81" dur="5.58">stress so in early phases of chronic</text><text start="1715.93" dur="4.5">stress cortisol goes up and the</text><text start="1718.39" dur="5.1">precursor the cortisol in the brain and</text><text start="1720.43" dur="4.98">ACTH goes up after that&apos;s been the case</text><text start="1723.49" dur="3.9">for a little while DHEA starts to go</text><text start="1725.41" dur="3.84">down because cortisol and DHEA are both</text><text start="1727.39" dur="3.78">made from the same precursor hormone</text><text start="1729.25" dur="3.63">called pregnenolone and it&apos;s a rate</text><text start="1731.17" dur="4.709">limited hormone there&apos;s a finite amount</text><text start="1732.88" dur="4.769">of it after a while if</text><text start="1735.879" dur="3.6">someone stays in chronic stress cortisol</text><text start="1737.649" dur="4.32">starts to drop too simply because the</text><text start="1739.479" dur="5.82">adrenal glands are fatigued and now DHA</text><text start="1741.969" dur="6.42">is way lower so you can see people in</text><text start="1745.299" dur="5.641">high or low cortisol adrenal stress</text><text start="1748.389" dur="7.35">states depending upon how long they are</text><text start="1750.94" dur="7.679">in that pathology but so so you can you</text><text start="1755.739" dur="5.701">can give someone bioidentical hormones</text><text start="1758.619" dur="4.321">or things that support hormones to get</text><text start="1761.44" dur="3.089">them in the right range quickly and make</text><text start="1762.94" dur="5.039">the person feel better so say you do a</text><text start="1764.529" dur="5.22">blood or a salivary hormone lab to look</text><text start="1767.979" dur="3.06">at adrenals you can do that but the big</text><text start="1769.749" dur="3.6">thing is just going to be dropping the</text><text start="1771.039" dur="5.91">stress low and the stress load is</text><text start="1773.349" dur="6.03">psychological and physiological so too</text><text start="1776.949" dur="5.7">much sugar and an unstable blood sugar</text><text start="1779.379" dur="6.48">cycle causes cortisol spiking body reads</text><text

the</text><text start="2174.47" dur="5.76">first studies that were done were done</text><text start="2176.269" dur="6.391">on memory and they found a 400% increase</text><text start="2180.23"

start="2203.18" dur="4.829">on the brink out that is so interesting</text><text start="2205.7" dur="4.47">it sounds like it&apos;s almost tricking the</text><text start="2208.009" dur="4.201">brain into thinking that is doing a</text><text start="2210.17" dur="4.379">better job at whatever it&apos;s already</text><text start="2212.21" dur="4.799">doing than it actually is and I wonder</text><text start="2214.549" dur="5.25">if it has a feedback loop where the</text><text start="2217.009" dur="4.83">brain picks up that oh this is really</text><text start="2219.799" dur="3.78">working and and then it knows how it</text><text start="2221.839" dur="3.631">arrived there because it was already</text><text start="2223.579" dur="3.93">doing that maybe just to a smaller</text><text start="2225.47" dur="3.869">degree and then it already knows how to</text><text start="2227.509" dur="6.05">do that and it does it better next time</text><text start="2229.339" dur="6.811">is that the case so there are some</text><text start="2233.559" dur="4.3">therapies where after you do them the</text><text start="2236.15" dur="3.57">brain continues to do them on its own</text><text start="2237.859" dur="3.631">because it learns how to do them that&apos;s</text><text start="2239.72" dur="5.94">kind of the exact opposite of the way we</text><text start="2241.49" dur="5.76">usually think of say psychopharmacology</text><text start="2245.66" dur="3.03">drugs right which is that they create</text><text start="2247.25" dur="2.88">dependence and addiction you get off of</text><text start="2248.69" dur="4.74">them and your brain can do that anymore</text><text start="2250.13" dur="6.449">because it overrode the natural</text><text start="2253.43" dur="5.22">regulatory system this is one of our</text><text start="2256.579" dur="4.831">primary design principles is that we</text><text start="2258.65" dur="4.409">want to understand what the brain&apos;s own</text><text start="2261.41" dur="3.419">regulatory process and the body&apos;s</text><text start="2263.059" dur="4.26">regulatory process is doing and support</text><text start="2264.829" dur="4.47">it rather than override it in a way that</text><text start="2267.319" dur="3.151">whenever someone stops with that</text><text start="2269.299" dur="4.371">particular technology</text><text start="2270.47" dur="6.389">gee you have a net neutral - net</text><text start="2273.67" dur="6.1">positive lasting effect rather than a</text><text start="2276.859" dur="5.01">down-regulation independence I would say</text><text start="2279.77" dur="5.31">good neural hacking in general should</text><text start="2281.869" dur="5.131">have that as one of its criteria with</text><text start="2285.08" dur="3.779">this particular one I don&apos;t think a</text><text start="2287.0" dur="3.15">study has been done yet on someone using</text><text start="2288.859" dur="3.091">it for a while and then stopping and</text><text start="2290.15" dur="5.13">seeing if they continue to get that</text><text start="2291.95" dur="5.64">elevation from baseline I wouldn&apos;t see</text><text start="2295.28" dur="4.829">it as much as it&apos;s trying to trick the</text><text start="2297.59" dur="5.91">brain as it is supporting it by adding</text><text start="2300.109" dur="5.071">energy right like if you&apos;re if there&apos;s</text><text start="2303.5" dur="3.27">three people pushing a car and one more</text><text start="2305.18" dur="5.07">person comes along to push it just goes</text><text start="2306.77" dur="4.95">better because there is you know more</text><text start="2310.25" dur="4.92">force being added to what&apos;s already</text><text start="2311.72" dur="6.72">happening and so here the goal was as</text><text start="2315.17" dur="4.83">the brain is modulating its frequency</text><text start="2318.44" dur="4.159">and it&apos;s at the max amplitude that it</text><text start="2320.0" dur="5.46">can generate if we can just add energy</text><text start="2322.599" dur="4.331">so we&apos;re adding amplitude we&apos;re just</text><text start="2325.46" dur="3.149">going to increase the efficiency of its</text><text start="2326.93" dur="4.26">process there&apos;s something very beautiful</text><text start="2328.609" dur="3.961">it does something very Aikido about not</text><text start="2331.19" dur="3.48">we know what the brain should be doing</text><text start="2332.57" dur="4.95">better and we&apos;re going to try and induce</text><text start="2334.67" dur="5.76">this specific frequency of Delta but we</text><text start="2337.52" dur="4.44">actually don&apos;t know why it is moving</text><text start="2340.43" dur="3.57">between the frequencies exactly the way</text><text start="2341.96" dur="4.17">that it does but we&apos;re gonna kind of</text><text start="2344.0" dur="2.94">trust it and follow it and just add</text><text start="2346.13" dur="3.33">resource</text><text start="2346.94" dur="5.31">I think stem cells is another way that</text><text start="2349.46" dur="5.37">you can think about that right did you</text><text start="2352.25" dur="4.77">think about stem cell therapy we don&apos;t</text><text start="2354.83" dur="4.2">know how the stem cells differentiate</text><text start="2357.02" dur="3.599">into tissues fully and then all the</text><text start="2359.03" dur="3.9">metabolic functions of those cells do</text><text start="2360.619" dur="5.821">but we&apos;re simply adding resource to the</text><text start="2362.93" dur="6.87">system in general I think the approach</text><text start="2366.44" dur="5.55">to support the system&apos;s own regulatory</text><text start="2369.8" dur="6.6">processes doing what they do better as</text><text start="2371.99" dur="6.75">opposed to trying to override them is a</text><text start="2376.4" dur="5.09">is a key distinction and how we should</text><text start="2378.74" dur="5.97">approach tech interface with the body</text><text start="2381.49" dur="5.8">interesting and so when it comes to</text><text start="2384.71" dur="5.159">supplements is this also your approach</text><text start="2387.29" dur="4.53">that you&apos;re trying to support what the</text><text start="2389.869" dur="3.901">body&apos;s already doing rather than kind of</text><text start="2391.82" dur="4.68">installing a new program oh this is how</text><text start="2393.77" dur="5.72">you&apos;re gonna do it body okay yeah of</text><text start="2396.5" dur="4.83">course so you know like with the</text><text start="2399.49" dur="3.34">supplements that we&apos;ve developed and</text><text start="2401.33" dur="2.97">more that we&apos;re in process of developing</text><text start="2402.83" dur="3.81">so let&apos;s</text><text start="2404.3" dur="5.04">take quality as an example it&apos;s a</text><text start="2406.64" dur="4.77">nootropic product cognitive enhancement</text><text start="2409.34" dur="3.99">product that we made because there&apos;s a</text><text start="2411.41" dur="3.57">good example here so some of the</text><text start="2413.33" dur="2.94">ingredients are actually just nutrients</text><text start="2414.98" dur="3.63">right they&apos;re nutrients that you should</text><text start="2416.27" dur="3.69">get in food and if you&apos;re eating a</text><text start="2418.61" dur="3.44">healthy diet you&apos;ll be getting more of</text><text start="2419.96" dur="5.82">them than not but their nutrients that</text><text start="2422.05" dur="6.91">either are very commonly deficient even</text><text start="2425.78" dur="4.47">in good diets for a number of reasons so</text><text start="2428.96" dur="3.69">certain trace minerals that are</text><text start="2430.25" dur="5.4">important for brain function they&apos;re</text><text start="2432.65" dur="5.82">just deficient in soil even organic soil</text><text start="2435.65" dur="4.56">is still very different than before the</text><text start="2438.47" dur="6.63">soil originally went through a bunch of</text><text start="2440.21" dur="6.21">mono cropping and plants can&apos;t make</text><text start="2445.1" dur="2.82">minerals right they&apos;re gonna pull up the</text><text start="2446.42" dur="3.42">minerals that are in the soil similarly</text><text start="2447.92" dur="3.6">if the soil is deficient in microbiota</text><text start="2449.84" dur="5.55">it&apos;s gonna affect the plant chemistry if</text><text start="2451.52" dur="5.34">the plants been hybridized so if there</text><text start="2455.39" dur="3.0">are common deficiencies in certain</text><text start="2456.86" dur="4.71">nutrients that are necessary for</text><text start="2458.39" dur="5.22">cognitive capacity or sleep or something</text><text start="2461.57" dur="4.02">like that making sure that there&apos;s</text><text start="2463.61" dur="4.02">enough of them that&apos;s just augmenting</text><text start="2465.59" dur="4.14">eating and that doesn&apos;t mean that you</text><text start="2467.63" dur="4.26">can then eat poorly right so I use the</text><text start="2469.73" dur="5.16">word supplement right is that it is to</text><text start="2471.89" dur="5.78">supplement to be in addition to because</text><text start="2474.89" dur="5.04">what someone takes a few grams of and</text><text start="2477.67" dur="4.33">pills compared to what they&apos;re taking</text><text start="2479.93" dur="4.2">like pounds up and food there&apos;s no way</text><text start="2482.0" dur="4.5">that that&apos;s going to replace the primary</text><text start="2484.13" dur="5.16">effect but it can meaningfully add to it</text><text start="2486.5" dur="5.49">but also it just like if someone is</text><text start="2489.29" dur="5.34">going to be using some function a lot</text><text start="2491.99" dur="3.84">more in an evolutionary environment</text><text start="2494.63" dur="3.24">would have had them use that function</text><text start="2495.83" dur="4.29">right so if Letta cailli someone&apos;s gonna</text><text start="2497.87" dur="4.44">be sweating a lot more they&apos;re going to</text><text start="2500.12" dur="3.54">lose electrolytes faster so we give them</text><text start="2502.31" dur="3.27">electrolytes and actually makes a</text><text start="2503.66" dur="5.07">difference where they&apos;re going to be</text><text start="2505.58" dur="4.62">using branched chain amino acids to</text><text start="2508.73" dur="3.12">build skeletal muscle more of they&apos;re</text><text start="2510.2" dur="3.63">tearing down skeletal muscle so we</text><text start="2511.85" dur="4.29">supplement brain shame yes there are</text><text start="2513.83" dur="3.6">nutrients that get used faster when</text><text start="2516.14" dur="3.48">someone is in certain kinds of cognitive</text><text start="2517.43" dur="3.75">process so if they want to spend a lot</text><text start="2519.62" dur="2.82">of time and peak cognitive process</text><text start="2521.18" dur="2.82">they&apos;re gonna burn through those quicker</text><text start="2522.44" dur="4.11">so you want to supplement them its brain</text><text start="2524.0" dur="6.24">nutrients and that is just the body&apos;s</text><text start="2526.55" dur="5.16">gonna convert those so say the the amino</text><text start="2530.24" dur="3.33">acids that can get converted to</text><text start="2531.71" dur="2.85">neurotransmitters the vitamins and</text><text start="2533.57" dur="2.34">minerals that are involved in the</text><text start="2534.56" dur="3.3">conversion process the body&apos;s going to</text><text start="2535.91" dur="3.39">convert them as it needs them but</text><text start="2537.86" dur="4.23">not going to have nutrition be a rate</text><text start="2539.3" dur="6.41">limiting factor so that&apos;s obviously</text><text start="2542.09" dur="8.58">working with endogenous pathway support</text><text start="2545.71" dur="9.01">there are other things where say we are</text><text start="2550.67" dur="9.41">looking at the acetylcholine pathway has</text><text start="2554.72"

interesting</text><text start="2803.839" dur="2.431">I wanted to rewind slide</text><text start="2805.28" dur="3.38">to where you&apos;re talking about</text><text start="2806.27" dur="5.7">neurotransmitters that regulate mood</text><text start="2808.66" dur="6.34">because there&apos;s a huge industry of</text><text start="2811.97" dur="5.94">selling drugs that regulate mood that</text><text start="2815.0" dur="5.16">actually have adverse long-term effects</text><text start="2817.91" dur="4.59">if you stop taking them or if you</text><text start="2820.16" dur="4.11">continue taking them they kind of lose</text><text start="2822.5" dur="5.49">their effectiveness in a way over time</text><text start="2824.27" dur="7.31">and for example I have experience taking</text><text start="2827.99" dur="6.87">SSRIs and I had both of those effects</text><text start="2831.58" dur="5.62">with withdrawal after coming off of them</text><text start="2834.86" dur="5.22">and and decreasing effectiveness over</text><text start="2837.2" dur="4.79">time but what you&apos;re talking about is</text><text start="2840.08" dur="5.25">that it&apos;s actually possible to have</text><text start="2841.99" dur="5.35">supplements or drugs that have net</text><text start="2845.33" dur="3.6">positive effects over time even if you</text><text start="2847.34" dur="3.33">stop taking them can you talk about that</text><text start="2848.93" dur="4.38">a bit specifically when it comes to mood</text><text start="2850.67" dur="8.84">regulation yeah so let me say that the</text><text start="2853.31" dur="9.06">the ideal way to approach this is a</text><text start="2859.51" dur="6.64">personalized medicine or personalized</text><text start="2862.37" dur="6.27">well-being approach because so say the</text><text start="2866.15" dur="5.4">SSRI did something good for you for a</text><text start="2868.64" dur="5.37">while but then it had side effects and</text><text start="2871.55" dur="4.38">it had down regulation and you adapted</text><text start="2874.01" dur="4.89">to it did it do some good for you</text><text start="2875.93" dur="4.86">because you actually had a dysbiosis</text><text start="2878.9" dur="4.56">issue in your gut where you just were</text><text start="2880.79" dur="4.56">not producing half of the serotonin that</text><text start="2883.46" dur="4.11">you need that&apos;s an important question</text><text start="2885.35" dur="4.53">right because if so I wouldn&apos;t even want</text><text start="2887.57" dur="6.45">to give you brain supplements I want to</text><text start="2889.88" dur="6.21">fix your gut or was there actually</text><text start="2894.02" dur="6.3">something where your diet was deficient</text><text start="2896.09" dur="6.18">in tryptophan and so the raw amino acid</text><text start="2900.32" dur="3.09">necessary to make serotonin was low and</text><text start="2902.27" dur="6.9">we just actually had to address your</text><text start="2903.41" dur="10.05">diet right or so there&apos;s so many things</text><text start="2909.17" dur="9.41">that can be involved and we can say in</text><text start="2913.46" dur="6.96">general if someone takes 5htp which is</text><text start="2918.58" dur="4.03">5-hydroxytryptophan hydroxylated</text><text start="2920.42" dur="4.8">tryptophan that&apos;s just one conversion</text><text start="2922.61" dur="5.16">step away from 5-hydroxytryptamine to</text><text start="2925.22" dur="5.67">serotonin and they take the</text><text start="2927.77" dur="7.68">phosphorylated version of b6 p5p that it</text><text start="2930.89" dur="7.68">converts the h5 HTTP to serotonin that</text><text start="2935.45" dur="3.81">they&apos;re much since that&apos;s just the stuff</text><text start="2938.57" dur="2.49">that</text><text start="2939.26" dur="3.78">is one step away from serotonin the body</text><text start="2941.06" dur="3.69">be working with any ways that they&apos;re</text><text start="2943.04" dur="4.17">less likely to get dependence and</text><text start="2944.75" dur="4.26">down-regulation from just having enough</text><text start="2947.21" dur="8.88">of those things than they would from an</text><text start="2949.01" dur="8.58">SSRI that&apos;s true and and ideally I would</text><text start="2956.09" dur="3.72">find out what&apos;s going on first because</text><text start="2957.59" dur="4.59">we also see so many people who they get</text><text start="2959.81" dur="5.34">on an SSRI and then they get much worse</text><text start="2962.18" dur="4.95">right so many of the shooting cases that</text><text start="2965.15" dur="3.93">we&apos;ve seen were after someone was put on</text><text start="2967.13" dur="3.96">an SSRI who hadn&apos;t been on it before and</text><text start="2969.08" dur="4.65">the suicidal homicidal tendencies are</text><text start="2971.09" dur="4.17">true because if someone is more dopamine</text><text start="2973.73" dur="3.42">deficient in their depression and they</text><text start="2975.26" dur="4.53">really needed something like wellbutrin</text><text start="2977.15" dur="4.44">instead like this is what&apos;s so crazy to</text><text start="2979.79" dur="5.16">me is we don&apos;t even do any kind of</text><text start="2981.59" dur="5.34">testing to see that the neurochemical</text><text start="2984.95" dur="4.62">imbalance before we give them chemistry</text><text start="2986.93" dur="4.47">rather than psychology and then to the</text><text start="2989.57" dur="3.03">degree that there even is a</text><text start="2991.4" dur="3.48">neurochemical amounts we don&apos;t know</text><text start="2992.6" dur="4.08">which one or which ones and then to the</text><text start="2994.88" dur="4.32">degree that we even knew which one we</text><text start="2996.68" dur="5.52">don&apos;t know why it&apos;s off and the answer</text><text start="2999.2" dur="7.7">is just straight to a drug yeah that&apos;s</text><text start="3002.2" dur="8.91">just crazy it is and think about this so</text><text start="3006.9" dur="8.11">your brain is as complex a system as we</text><text start="3011.11" dur="8.37">know of existing in universe right and</text><text start="3015.01" dur="5.88">you&apos;ve got the the number of neurons and</text><text start="3019.48" dur="2.79">of glial cells and the number of</text><text start="3020.89" dur="4.29">synaptic connections and the number</text><text start="3022.27" dur="4.53">metabolic processes per individual one</text><text start="3025.18" dur="3.69">and the feedback and feed-forward</text><text start="3026.8" dur="5.88">processes is just completely</text><text start="3028.87" dur="6.05">mind-boggling so when you think about</text><text start="3032.68" dur="5.04">something like serotonin right that is a</text><text start="3034.92" dur="6.1">it&apos;s a signaling molecule that&apos;s the end</text><text start="3037.72" dur="5.97">of many steps of metabolic transform so</text><text start="3041.02" dur="4.62">if it&apos;s low how likely is it that other</text><text start="3043.69" dur="3.45">things are low or high or dysregulated</text><text start="3045.64" dur="3.42">or there&apos;s something else off like it&apos;s</text><text start="3047.14" dur="3.36">pretty high right when we just go</text><text start="3049.06" dur="3.51">straight to let&apos;s get more serotonin</text><text start="3050.5" dur="8.67">right let&apos;s keep it from you know</text><text start="3052.57" dur="9.72">reuptake and because we have to you know</text><text start="3059.17" dur="5.43">in the drug the drug industry has to use</text><text start="3062.29" dur="4.05">synthetic single molecules to be able to</text><text start="3064.6" dur="2.94">get them patented which is the only way</text><text start="3066.34" dur="4.62">that they could ever make enough money</text><text start="3067.54" dur="5.1">to go through FDA trials and that&apos;s FDA</text><text start="3070.96" dur="3.48">but every country has you</text><text start="3072.64" dur="3.99">some version but I think us probably</text><text start="3074.44" dur="5.4">leads the way in some of both the good</text><text start="3076.63" dur="5.84">and bad aspects of this what&apos;s the</text><text start="3079.84" dur="4.8">chance that a single synthetic molecule</text><text start="3082.47" dur="3.79">meaning it&apos;s not part of your natural</text><text start="3084.64" dur="4.2">landscape at all and it&apos;s just one</text><text start="3086.26" dur="4.86">molecule could ever be an adequate</text><text start="3088.84" dur="4.38">solution to a complex chemistry</text><text start="3091.12" dur="5.34">dysregulation in a self-organizing</text><text start="3093.22" dur="6.03">system like your brain like it just</text><text start="3096.46" dur="4.62">doesn&apos;t even make sense right it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="3099.25" dur="3.42">make sense that that could possibly be</text><text start="3101.08" dur="4.62">the thing that&apos;s really gonna repair it</text><text start="3102.67" dur="5.34">yeah so it&apos;s usually gonna be not one</text><text start="3105.7" dur="4.8">molecule that&apos;s off but lots of them and</text><text start="3108.01" dur="4.74">so then we have to from maybe lots of</text><text start="3110.5" dur="4.29">different processes so how do we</text><text start="3112.75" dur="5.28">identify what&apos;s going on and support the</text><text start="3114.79" dur="5.88">system&apos;s increasing its own internal</text><text start="3118.03" dur="4.71">resilience I mean this same is like when</text><text start="3120.67" dur="3.3">you talk about cognitive chemistry this</text><text start="3122.74" dur="3.66">cognitive chemistry mediated via</text><text start="3123.97"

those</text><text start="3131.41" dur="3.9">things right complex interactions and</text><text start="3133.27" dur="3.45">lots of those things and so one of the</text><text start="3135.31" dur="3.21">key things is that when you&apos;re wanting</text><text start="3136.72" dur="3.78">to work with a complex system like a</text><text start="3138.52" dur="5.22">brain you&apos;ve really got to have a more</text><text start="3140.5" dur="6.0">complexity informed approach than single</text><text start="3143.74" dur="4.5">molecule interventions mm-hmm so you&apos;re</text><text start="3146.5" dur="4.44">saying we&apos;re mostly involved in this</text><text start="3148.24" dur="5.67">single molecule interventions because</text><text start="3150.94" dur="4.47">that&apos;s

because it&apos;s</text><text start="3157.63" dur="4.29">profitable it&apos;s only thing you can even</text><text start="3158.89" dur="4.41">afford to do research on right you know</text><text start="3161.92" dur="3.3">when you hear things like well there are</text><text start="3163.3" dur="2.55">not so many good scientific trials done</text><text start="3165.22" dur="3.03">on herbs</text><text start="3165.85" dur="4.2">who the would pay for them I mean</text><text start="3168.25" dur="4.23">you&apos;ll see little trials done on herbs</text><text start="3170.05" dur="5.13">but it costs a billion dollars give or</text><text start="3172.48" dur="4.53">take to take a drug through FDA approval</text><text start="3175.18" dur="4.11">well who&apos;s gonna put in a billion</text><text start="3177.01" dur="3.63">dollars and then when you take the drug</text><text start="3179.29" dur="2.58">through you&apos;re not even sure that it&apos;s</text><text start="3180.64" dur="2.76">gonna work in the market and then you</text><text start="3181.87" dur="3.33">have a class-action lawsuit at the end</text><text start="3183.4" dur="3.42">like you&apos;ve got to have a twenty billion</text><text start="3185.2" dur="4.38">dollar potential on that for it to make</text><text start="3186.82" dur="4.35">any sense to even embark on right so of</text><text start="3189.58" dur="4.17">course you&apos;ve got to have a patent on it</text><text start="3191.17" dur="5.76">and so if you have something that&apos;s not</text><text start="3193.75"

start="3239.86" dur="5.22">synthetics can&apos;t get patented because</text><text start="3241.68" dur="4.87">you know the information was already</text><text start="3245.08" dur="4.47">released and so now it&apos;s part of the</text><text start="3246.55" dur="6.0">Commons or after the patent life on a</text><text start="3249.55" dur="4.53">drug expires and so now it&apos;s not really</text><text start="3252.55" dur="4.08">profitable because the generics are all</text><text start="3254.08" dur="4.44">going to be really cheap then we need to</text><text start="3256.63" dur="3.54">before a drug company look for a new</text><text start="3258.52" dur="3.78">thing in that space even if the new</text><text start="3260.17" dur="3.66">things are not better or even shittier</text><text start="3262.3" dur="4.17">than the previous thing simply because</text><text start="3263.83" dur="5.61">we just can&apos;t make money doing that so</text><text start="3266.47" dur="5.13">what are the ways around it supplements</text><text start="3269.44" dur="4.02">don&apos;t have to go through FDA approval</text><text start="3271.6" dur="4.2">think about from pharmaceutical industry</text><text start="3273.46" dur="5.04">what it means to invest something like a</text><text start="3275.8" dur="5.31">billion dollars of capital before you&apos;ve</text><text start="3278.5" dur="4.59">made your first dollar back right like</text><text start="3281.11" dur="4.68">that&apos;s so far from Silicon Valley</text><text start="3283.09" dur="5.91">software tech thinking that&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="3285.79" dur="7.17">money to invest before you know actually</text><text start="3289.0" dur="6.48">having any revenue but yeah so</text><text start="3292.96" dur="5.55">supplements they don&apos;t have to do that</text><text start="3295.48" dur="5.7">but they can&apos;t claim that they have any</text><text start="3298.51" dur="3.9">medical purpose or heal anything so then</text><text start="3301.18" dur="2.31">that becomes the tricky thing if they</text><text start="3302.41" dur="2.55">want to claim it they have to go through</text><text start="3303.49" dur="3.74">FDA process if they&apos;re gonna go through</text><text start="3304.96" dur="4.23">FDA process that&apos;s super expensive and</text><text start="3307.23" dur="3.58">they&apos;re gonna have to have a profit</text><text start="3309.19" dur="4.14">stream to be able to justify it so</text><text start="3310.81" dur="6.27">that&apos;s the deal basically to really fix</text><text start="3313.33" dur="5.43">that the entire regulatory financial and</text><text start="3317.08" dur="5.55">intellectual property structures have to</text><text start="3318.76" dur="7.31">be changed and realistically I can say</text><text start="3322.63" dur="5.88">for-profit medicine is a broken system</text><text start="3326.07" dur="7.08">because when you have a for-profit sick</text><text start="3328.51" dur="7.14">care system where people come in ill</text><text start="3333.15" dur="4.57">pharmaceuticals or hospitals or</text><text start="3335.65" dur="4.05">insurance or anybody you know any money</text><text start="3337.72" dur="3.84">that&apos;s going to be made in the</text><text start="3339.7" dur="3.27">two trillion dollar complex of health</text><text start="3341.56" dur="3.69">care is only made when people are sick</text><text start="3342.97" dur="7.47">so prevention would just obsolete that</text><text start="3345.25" dur="6.78">entire profit stream right and so then</text><text start="3350.44" dur="5.7">you start thinking about patients as</text><text start="3352.03" dur="5.64">customers and every MBA first thing they</text><text start="3356.14" dur="4.86">learn is how do you maximize the</text><text start="3357.67" dur="5.01">lifetime value of a customer and that</text><text start="3361.0" dur="4.109">should never apply to a patient right</text><text start="3362.68" dur="4.47">theory of markets the free market should</text><text start="3365.109" dur="4.411">apply to things that one can choose in</text><text start="3367.15" dur="5.939">to choose out of you can&apos;t reasonably</text><text start="3369.52" dur="7.14">choose out of health care and so it</text><text start="3373.089" dur="5.341">should not be structured in the</text><text start="3376.66" dur="3.81">for-profit way that it is any more than</text><text start="3378.43" dur="3.51">for-profit prisons should be yeah you&apos;re</text><text start="3380.47" dur="4.92">optimizing for what you don&apos;t want</text><text start="3381.94" dur="4.71">exactly you know as I was talking to a</text><text start="3385.39" dur="3.6">group that was working on peace and</text><text start="3386.65" dur="5.1">reconciliation the other day and I asked</text><text start="3388.99" dur="6.03">them what&apos;s the chance of having the</text><text start="3391.75" dur="5.07">world free from war or any militarized</text><text start="3395.02" dur="4.05">conflict while having a for-profit</text><text start="3396.82" dur="5.73">military-industrial complex lastingly</text><text start="3399.07" dur="5.549">and they realized that supply and demand</text><text start="3402.55" dur="3.69">theory says zero percent chance that</text><text start="3404.619" dur="5.97">those two could coexist in during Lee</text><text start="3406.24" dur="6.24">right because if there isn&apos;t demand for</text><text start="3410.589" dur="4.471">that supply it&apos;ll shut down and stop</text><text start="3412.48" dur="5.58">existing will be a for-profit complex or</text><text start="3415.06" dur="8.19">it will have to do supply-side economics</text><text start="3418.06" dur="8.299">and create demand and so that means that</text><text start="3423.25" dur="8.13">you have the largest block of economics</text><text start="3426.359" dur="8.351">have its own survival antithetical to</text><text start="3431.38" dur="7.229">global peace that&apos;s that&apos;s a up</text><text start="3434.71" dur="5.25">structure for Humanity and for-profit</text><text start="3438.609" dur="2.641">prisons are the same and for-profit</text><text start="3439.96" dur="3.06">health care is the same when you start</text><text start="3441.25" dur="4.859">going through you see how many places</text><text start="3443.02" dur="5.43">the financial incentive the game theory</text><text start="3446.109" dur="5.851">is exactly opposite to what the</text><text start="3448.45" dur="5.6">collective goal should be so like what</text><text start="3451.96" dur="5.46">it takes to really fix medicine and</text><text start="3454.05" dur="6.039">health care and well-being care etc the</text><text start="3457.42" dur="4.649">IP has to change where we&apos;re not focused</text><text start="3460.089" dur="4.141">on patentable things and then separate</text><text start="3462.069" dur="4.52">patents that can&apos;t be combined because</text><text start="3464.23" dur="5.25">different IP holders have them and only</text><text start="3466.589" dur="4.841">unnatural things etc but the whole IP</text><text start="3469.48" dur="3.84">process is broken and it needs to move</text><text start="3471.43" dur="4.74">to maximum innovation</text><text start="3473.32" dur="4.68">ownership restriction the financial</text><text start="3476.17" dur="4.41">models have to change where all the</text><text start="3478.0" dur="4.47">financial incentive is aligned with what</text><text start="3480.58" dur="3.72">we actually want which is optimized</text><text start="3482.47" dur="4.44">collective well-being not otherwise and</text><text start="3484.3" dur="4.8">that doesn&apos;t look like any fiscal health</text><text start="3486.91" dur="7.77">care system we&apos;ve had and the scientific</text><text start="3489.1" dur="7.2">model has to change rather than a you</text><text start="3494.68" dur="5.19">know small number of variable</text><text start="3496.3" dur="5.55">reductionist approach to understanding a</text><text start="3499.87" dur="3.69">complex self-organizing system we have</text><text start="3501.85" dur="4.44">to actually get better at complexity</text><text start="3503.56" dur="4.83">science and understanding the body as a</text><text start="3506.29" dur="3.09">regulatory system the body mind complex</text><text start="3508.39" dur="3.6">regulatory system</text><text start="3509.38" dur="5.76">what causes regulatory breakdown and how</text><text start="3511.99" dur="5.64">to support increased regulatory capacity</text><text start="3515.14" dur="5.34">of the system rather than just</text><text start="3517.63" dur="5.49">overriding it all the time right it&apos;s a</text><text start="3520.48" dur="4.71">whole different set of incentives it&apos;s a</text><text start="3523.12" dur="4.2">different kind of science it&apos;s different</text><text start="3525.19" dur="5.16">incentives and it&apos;s different legal</text><text start="3527.32" dur="4.2">structures and so yes there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="3530.35" dur="2.85">things that we want to evolve in</text><text start="3531.52" dur="4.08">diagnostic medicine and therapeutic</text><text start="3533.2" dur="4.86">medicine and AI interpretation and you</text><text start="3535.6" dur="5.55">know but deeper than all that are these</text><text start="3538.06" dur="5.28">meta structures that need to evolve so</text><text start="3541.15" dur="5.01">going back to the kind of specific</text><text start="3543.34" dur="3.57">approaches that you are taking how are</text><text start="3546.16" dur="2.55">you</text><text start="3546.91" dur="3.21">building these meta structures in a</text><text start="3548.71" dur="6.21">different way than they currently exist</text><text start="3550.12" dur="6.78">yeah so we&apos;re obviously within the</text><text start="3554.92" dur="4.23">within the confines of those meta</text><text start="3556.9" dur="4.89">structures to begin with so we&apos;re our</text><text start="3559.15" dur="5.06">first products are supplements the</text><text start="3561.79" dur="4.89">reason why we chose to do supplements is</text><text start="3564.21" dur="3.7">to be able to bring things direct to</text><text start="3566.68" dur="3.09">consumer that&apos;s what it&apos;s going to be</text><text start="3567.91" dur="4.13">called rather than to go through FDA</text><text start="3569.77" dur="4.41">process and a doctor process and</text><text start="3572.04" dur="4.81">specifically since we&apos;re working with</text><text start="3574.18" dur="4.5">some synthetics but largely you know</text><text start="3576.85" dur="3.59">synthetics and natural compounds both so</text><text start="3578.68" dur="4.5">a lot of unpatentable things and</text><text start="3580.44" dur="4.42">combinations of them and you know moving</text><text start="3583.18" dur="4.53">towards customizable combinations it&apos;s</text><text start="3584.86" dur="4.14">outside of patentability so for all</text><text start="3587.71" dur="4.83">those reasons that made sense and</text><text start="3589.0" dur="5.79">because we wanted to be able to control</text><text start="3592.54" dur="5.37">the integrity of the company we wanted</text><text start="3594.79" dur="6.12">to take on very little capital and only</text><text start="3597.91" dur="4.38">very values align capital and so we</text><text start="3600.91" dur="3.18">wanted to build things that we could</text><text start="3602.29" dur="3.14">actually build ourselves first to then</text><text start="3604.09" dur="3.29">be able to grow the company and</text><text start="3605.43" dur="4.119">continues for like friends</text><text start="3607.38" dur="4.389">the first product we brought to market</text><text start="3609.549" dur="6.06">quality our cogs on their right just our</text><text start="3611.769" dur="5.85">cost of goods is higher than the retail</text><text start="3615.609" dur="4.89">costs of most other cognitive enhancers</text><text start="3617.619" dur="4.5">on the market and all the investors</text><text start="3620.499" dur="3.51">looked at well you got to get the cogs</text><text start="3622.119" dur="4.801">down and like there is no way to get it</text><text start="3624.009" dur="5.01">down until we get to huge economies of</text><text start="3626.92" dur="4.939">scale and vert and owning our own supply</text><text start="3629.019" dur="5.191">chain without cutting quality because I</text><text start="3631.859" dur="4.66">run a bunch of additional steps of</text><text start="3634.21" dur="4.23">testing to make sure that there&apos;s you</text><text start="3636.519" dur="3.96">know optimized purity and potency and</text><text start="3638.44" dur="4.71">that no mycotoxin or whatever got into</text><text start="3640.479" dur="4.921">the supply and manufacturing and use</text><text start="3643.15" dur="4.949">forms that are more expensive forms of</text><text start="3645.4" dur="4.29">all the ingredients and you know amounts</text><text start="3648.099" dur="4.77">that are actually meaningful which is</text><text start="3649.69" dur="5.909">expensive so part of it is when you&apos;re</text><text start="3652.869" dur="4.86">working within those structures knowing</text><text start="3655.599" dur="3.9">what your mission is very clearly so</text><text start="3657.729" dur="3.54">your mission is not delivering returns</text><text start="3659.499" dur="3.51">to shareholders first it&apos;s actually</text><text start="3661.269" dur="3.6">delivering meaningful technology to</text><text start="3663.009" dur="3.06">enrich people&apos;s lives and if you don&apos;t</text><text start="3664.869" dur="3.841">have something that they&apos;ll do that you</text><text start="3666.069" dur="6.361">just don&apos;t do it that&apos;s a really key</text><text start="3668.71" dur="7.619">first part of it right and then being</text><text start="3672.43" dur="8.7">able to grow while maintaining control</text><text start="3676.329" dur="5.97">of that mission is a key part of it how</text><text start="3681.13" dur="3.56">else we working with those meta</text><text start="3682.299" dur="5.07">structures well we open-source our</text><text start="3684.69" dur="5.23">information so as far as IP we just</text><text start="3687.369" dur="5.311">don&apos;t believe in it so rather than say</text><text start="3689.92" dur="4.889">we have a proprietary blend of this</text><text start="3692.68" dur="4.049">number of milligrams of things we just</text><text start="3694.809" dur="3.69">have the exact number of milligrams of</text><text start="3696.729" dur="3.421">the exact sources and all the sourcing</text><text start="3698.499" dur="2.82">info so if anyone wants to just go buy</text><text start="3700.15" dur="2.73">the raw ingredients make it themselves</text><text start="3701.319" dur="3.0">they&apos;re welcome to if someone wants to</text><text start="3702.88" dur="3.989">try and make a better formula they can</text><text start="3704.319" dur="5.46">because we just want to support the</text><text start="3706.869" dur="6.12">field advancing for optimized human</text><text start="3709.779" dur="5.361">wellbeing as best as possible and so</text><text start="3712.989" dur="7.01">that&apos;s we we have a strong open-source</text><text start="3715.14" dur="7.209">take on everything IP and then</text><text start="3719.999" dur="5.201">reinvesting our capital in developing</text><text start="3722.349" dur="5.01">new technologies and really focusing on</text><text start="3725.2" dur="4.349">not where is the highest profit margin</text><text start="3727.359" dur="3.36">technology but what are the technologies</text><text start="3729.549" dur="2.73">that will really make the biggest</text><text start="3730.719" dur="2.941">difference in addressing the
