there&apos;s a</text><text start="4.08" dur="3.09">gazillion examples and what we call the</text><text start="5.759" dur="2.731">political left and right today might</text><text start="7.17" dur="6.96">seem actually quite different than what</text><text start="8.49" dur="8.28">it was in the past so let&apos;s take a kind</text><text start="14.13" dur="5.159">of what had previous to recently been</text><text start="16.77" dur="5.4">kind of some essential ideas and</text><text start="19.289" dur="4.371">Republican or Democrat platforms so we</text><text start="22.17" dur="5.34">kind of have this Republican right</text><text start="23.66" dur="6.34">oriented idea of wanting to empower the</text><text start="27.51" dur="6.299">self responsibility and sovereignty of</text><text start="30.0" dur="6.39">the individual and more individualistic</text><text start="33.809" dur="4.531">and so smaller government less social</text><text start="36.39" dur="3.09">services more empowering of those who</text><text start="38.34" dur="3.809">are entrepreneurial and pull themselves</text><text start="39.48" dur="5.28">up by their bootstraps and you know that</text><text start="42.149" dur="6.57">kind of thing and then you have the kind</text><text start="44.76" dur="6.45">of more democratic left perspective that</text><text start="48.719" dur="3.991">says well and here it&apos;s saying the</text><text start="51.21" dur="3.36">collective is actually created by the</text><text start="52.71" dur="3.779">individual so we want to empower the</text><text start="54.57" dur="3.39">individuals that are creative and take</text><text start="56.489" dur="2.82">agency because better individuals make a</text><text start="57.96" dur="3.75">better whole that&apos;s kind of the gist</text><text start="59.309" dur="4.14">over here it&apos;s like well but the</text><text start="61.71" dur="3.33">individuals are being conditioned by the</text><text start="63.449" dur="3.361">environment that they&apos;re born into by</text><text start="65.04" dur="3.689">the whole and so even though I can&apos;t</text><text start="66.81" dur="3.059">find that one story of that one guy who</text><text start="68.729" dur="2.671">pulled themselves up by the bootstraps</text><text start="69.869" dur="2.911">and the ghetto there&apos;s a whole lot more</text><text start="71.4" dur="3.93">people that succeeded who were born into</text><text start="72.78" dur="4.65">the Hamptons and born into South Central</text><text start="75.33" dur="4.23">and so let&apos;s create better environments</text><text start="77.43" dur="3.72">that actually condition better people</text><text start="79.56" dur="4.849">because there&apos;s top-down effects the</text><text start="81.15" dur="7.55">holes create affecting the individuals</text><text start="84.409" dur="7.541">so there&apos;s there&apos;s for many people some</text><text start="88.7" dur="9.4">seemingly compelling truth in both of</text><text start="91.95" dur="9.029">these and also problems right so there</text><text start="98.1" dur="5.67">can be a right oriented perspective that</text><text start="100.979" dur="4.32">says hey look if we set up social</text><text start="103.77" dur="4.68">services in welfare and whatever we</text><text start="105.299" dur="5.401">actually condition shittier people who</text><text start="108.45" dur="4.62">are less strong and resilient in the</text><text start="110.7" dur="4.11">face of the environment we D incentivize</text><text start="113.07" dur="5.7">those who are most entrepreneur and</text><text start="114.81" dur="8.55">creative like what and we make people</text><text start="118.77" dur="6.12">who are doing badly still do well and</text><text start="123.36" dur="2.549">that actually kind of down regulates the</text><text start="124.89" dur="2.729">evolutionary pressure in the whole</text><text start="125.909" dur="3.6">system like why would we want to do that</text><text start="127.619" dur="3.751">and of course over here we can have a</text><text start="129.509" dur="3.961">kind of left perspective that says yeah</text><text start="131.37" dur="4.47">but some people are getting ahead</text><text start="133.47" dur="3.84">using shared services that the</text><text start="135.84" dur="2.91">government pays for from everybody&apos;s tax</text><text start="137.31" dur="3.09">money that they aren&apos;t actually really</text><text start="138.75" dur="3.27">accounting for and they&apos;re affecting the</text><text start="140.4" dur="3.42">commons negatively in a way that is</text><text start="142.02" dur="3.78">externalizing the cost everyone else so</text><text start="143.82" dur="3.15">that they&apos;re being claimed to be more</text><text start="145.8" dur="2.49">entrepreneurial it just means they&apos;re</text><text start="146.97" dur="2.88">extracting from the commons and</text><text start="148.29" dur="9.71">externalizing cost to the commons better</text><text start="149.85" dur="11.34">and do we do we really want to let</text><text start="158.0" dur="4.63">people die on the footsteps of hospitals</text><text start="161.19" dur="3.03">because they don&apos;t have money or</text><text start="162.63" dur="3.51">insurance you know in the fully</text><text start="164.22" dur="5.91">individualistic libertarian kind of idea</text><text start="166.14" dur="7.74">and fully libertarian kind of ideology</text><text start="170.13" dur="5.46">can&apos;t solve multipolar traps and so like</text><text start="173.88" dur="3.09">but there&apos;s there&apos;s clearly truth in</text><text start="175.59" dur="4.02">both of these and they are clearly</text><text start="176.97" dur="5.04">neither complex enough to actually</text><text start="179.61" dur="4.26">handle reality in which there are</text><text start="182.01" dur="2.91">bottom-up effects where the individuals</text><text start="183.87" dur="2.55">effect the whole and there&apos;s also a</text><text start="184.92" dur="2.52">top-down effects for the wholes in turn</text><text start="186.42" dur="2.46">affect the individual and there&apos;s</text><text start="187.44" dur="2.73">feedback and feed-forward loops and</text><text start="188.88" dur="3.54">neither of them are factoring those</text><text start="190.17" dur="4.74">enough but the debate process doesn&apos;t</text><text start="192.42" dur="5.19">bring about dialectic right the debate</text><text start="194.91" dur="5.13">process is here actually make the idea</text><text start="197.61" dur="5.129">more polarized to get people on this</text><text start="200.04" dur="5.13">side emphasize rhetoric over real sense</text><text start="202.739" dur="3.991">making and emphasize winning over</text><text start="205.17" dur="4.59">collectively trying to make sense</text><text start="206.73" dur="4.56">together so the debate process is not a</text><text start="209.76" dur="4.41">good sense making process it&apos;s a</text><text start="211.29" dur="4.29">narrative warfare process dialectic is</text><text start="214.17" dur="2.85">different which says okay I think we</text><text start="215.58" dur="2.909">have some truth and not all of it I</text><text start="217.02" dur="3.18">think you have some let&apos;s endeavor</text><text start="218.489" dur="2.97">together earnestly to figure out the</text><text start="220.2" dur="3.84">things that we&apos;re all interested in</text><text start="221.459" dur="7.681">figuring out and then we start to say</text><text start="224.04" dur="7.199">okay well do we want that do we want</text><text start="229.14" dur="4.11">better individuals who are more</text><text start="231.239" dur="4.561">sovereign independent of environment dot</text><text start="233.25" dur="4.5">nobody doesn&apos;t want that or do we want</text><text start="235.8" dur="4.17">holes that support all the individuals</text><text start="237.75" dur="5.489">within them to do better well duh we</text><text start="239.97" dur="6.63">want that too but the way that we&apos;ve</text><text start="243.239" dur="5.641">done social services makes oftentimes</text><text start="246.6" dur="4.65">some of them makes the people not more</text><text start="248.88" dur="3.69">sovereign but more dependent so it&apos;s</text><text start="251.25" dur="2.519">actually not making better people it&apos;s</text><text start="252.57" dur="4.53">making more comfortable but shittier</text><text start="253.769" dur="5.491">people right and the way that we incent</text><text start="257.1" dur="3.78">individuals over here in sense people</text><text start="259.26" dur="3.51">who are entrepreneurial but by</text><text start="260.88" dur="3.36">externalizing costs to the Commons and</text><text start="262.77" dur="2.35">creating radical wealth inequality so</text><text start="264.24" dur="3.28">it&apos;s</text><text start="265.12" dur="3.75">incentivizing the most truly creative</text><text start="267.52" dur="3.27">and intelligent and good people it&apos;s</text><text start="268.87" dur="4.26">incentivizing effective sociopathy and</text><text start="270.79" dur="3.54">things like that so like neither of</text><text start="273.13" dur="3.06">these are doing all that good at the</text><text start="274.33" dur="5.88">thing they&apos;re even claiming to do so how</text><text start="276.19" dur="6.12">do we create social services Collective</text><text start="280.21" dur="4.41">processes that condition healthier</text><text start="282.31" dur="3.81">people who are more sovereign how do we</text><text start="284.62" dur="3.24">create environments that condition</text><text start="286.12" dur="3.57">people who do better in any environment</text><text start="287.86" dur="3.57">right that actually conditions strength</text><text start="289.69" dur="3.99">and resilience and sovereignty in the</text><text start="291.43" dur="4.29">individuals who then in turn affect the</text><text start="293.68" dur="3.33">environments in ways that support the</text><text start="295.72" dur="4.56">increased sovereignty of everybody else</text><text start="297.01" dur="5.1">that&apos;s a totally higher-order way of</text><text start="300.28" dur="4.62">starting to think about the relationship</text><text start="302.11" dur="4.92">between them that starts to recognize</text><text start="304.9" dur="4.769">the inexorable failing of both of those</text><text start="307.03" dur="5.97">perspectives and and that what the</text><text start="309.669" dur="7.201">approach would take is more complex</text><text start="313.0" dur="6.479">right that&apos;s an example of starting to</text><text start="316.87" dur="8.579">move towards synthesis from a thesis and</text><text start="319.479" dur="7.891">an antithesis right and if you if you</text><text start="325.449" dur="3.72">look at even personal things in your</text><text start="327.37" dur="4.019">life you&apos;re wrestling with like okay do</text><text start="329.169" dur="3.991">I want to accept and love reality and</text><text start="331.389" dur="3.211">people and myself as I am or do I want</text><text start="333.16" dur="4.56">to like help strive to make things</text><text start="334.6" dur="4.83">better there they&apos;re similar like those</text><text start="337.72" dur="3.96">types of things you&apos;ll find a thesis</text><text start="339.43" dur="4.56">antithesis everywhere or the actual</text><text start="341.68" dur="4.97">insight to synthesis is novel insight</text><text start="343.99" dur="6.12">not contained in either of those if I</text><text start="346.65" dur="7.63">when I say accept you as you are right</text><text start="350.11" dur="5.989">now or help work to change you to make</text><text start="354.28" dur="4.56">you better and I see those as as</text><text start="356.099" dur="5.32">different it&apos;s because I&apos;m seeing you as</text><text start="358.84" dur="4.38">a noun and I&apos;m seeing you as a fixed</text><text start="361.419" dur="5.281">thing or accept you as you are you are</text><text start="363.22" dur="5.73">this current state whereas if I see you</text><text start="366.7" dur="4.02">as a process if I see you as a verb I</text><text start="368.95" dur="3.029">see you as a becoming that is different</text><text start="370.72" dur="2.46">than you were yesterday and different</text><text start="371.979" dur="3.931">than you were when you were two right</text><text start="373.18" dur="5.58">then accepting you as you are and</text><text start="375.91" dur="4.259">includes dynamism includes the impulse</text><text start="378.76" dur="2.909">to change grow and evolve so I can</text><text start="380.169" dur="2.731">accept you fully as you are which in</text><text start="381.669" dur="3.091">love you is you are which includes</text><text start="382.9" dur="4.769">accepting and loving the impulse to grow</text><text start="384.76" dur="5.67">and expand and include and transcend so</text><text start="387.669" dur="4.62">I can support you to become more not on</text><text start="390.43" dur="5.489">the basis of judging you as insufficient</text><text start="392.289" dur="4.711">but loving you completely including</text><text start="395.919" dur="1.951">loving the evolutionary trajectory</text><text start="397.0" dur="3.48">inside</text><text start="397.87" dur="4.17">right but that insight of you as a verb</text><text start="400.48" dur="3.78">rather than as a noun was actually not</text><text start="402.04" dur="4.53">captured in either of these so the</text><text start="404.26" dur="4.02">dialectic process of saying like okay</text><text start="406.57" dur="4.89">well how do I see the partial truth here</text><text start="408.28" dur="5.73">construct this fully and then how do I</text><text start="411.46" dur="6.92">see the partial truth here construct</text><text start="414.01" dur="6.99">this fully and then what new insights</text><text start="418.38" dur="4.36">bring these together in the higher order</text><text start="421.0" dur="4.8">perspective that is more complex and</text><text start="422.74" dur="4.68">more nuanced than either of them so</text><text start="425.8" dur="3.21">that&apos;s kind of a dialectic process and</text><text start="427.42" dur="2.79">it might not just be to thesis</text><text start="429.01" dur="6.69">antithesis might be the lots of</text><text start="430.21" dur="7.5">perspectives this is it - I would this</text><text start="435.7" dur="3.87">is a process that I would love to see</text><text start="437.71" dur="4.05">people start practicing at for sense</text><text start="439.57" dur="4.26">making of whenever they&apos;re talking with</text><text start="441.76" dur="5.19">someone start by seeking to understand</text><text start="443.83" dur="4.86">before seeking to be understood and seek</text><text start="446.95" dur="4.47">for the truth value and what people are</text><text start="448.69" dur="4.26">saying not just the wrongness but then</text><text start="451.42" dur="2.91">don&apos;t holistically throw out what</text><text start="452.95" dur="3.39">they&apos;re saying is totally wrong or</text><text start="454.33" dur="5.19">totally true be able to separate that</text><text start="456.34" dur="5.34">there is signal and noise and then be</text><text start="459.52" dur="4.62">able to say if I see signal from a</text><text start="461.68" dur="5.6">number of sources how does that fit</text><text start="464.14" dur="5.91">together into higher-order perspective</text><text start="467.28" dur="3.43">this this is another sense making</text><text start="470.05" dur="3.03">process</text><text start="470.71" dur="6.27">you mentioned emotion and vulnerability</text><text start="473.08" dur="5.49">as key components of sense making could</text><text start="476.98" dur="3.74">you that may seem a little bit</text><text start="478.57" dur="5.93">counterintuitive to people can you</text><text start="480.72" dur="6.64">explain what you mean by that if I want</text><text start="484.5" dur="5.29">to make sense of the world well and I&apos;m</text><text start="487.36" dur="4.23">gonna engage in some communication</text><text start="489.79" dur="3.21">processes with other people to make</text><text start="491.59" dur="7.08">sense of the world as I&apos;m a collective</text><text start="493.0" dur="8.1">sense making then I want them to share</text><text start="498.67" dur="5.19">true information with me to not dis</text><text start="501.1" dur="5.34">inform nor withhold so how do I create</text><text start="503.86" dur="4.92">the trust and psychological safety for</text><text start="506.44" dur="5.1">them to do that well I&apos;m probably gonna</text><text start="508.78" dur="5.94">have to do that too and so how do we</text><text start="511.54" dur="4.83">create mutual trust and psychologic</text><text start="514.72" dur="2.85">safety that we&apos;re not going to use the</text><text start="516.37" dur="2.7">information that we&apos;re sharing with each</text><text start="517.57" dur="5.12">other in game theoretic ways with each</text><text start="519.07" dur="9.889">other that&apos;s a huge part</text><text start="522.69" dur="7.829">and if people don&apos;t have some spaces and</text><text start="528.959" dur="3.81">some relationships where they feel like</text><text start="530.519" dur="5.341">they can actually share fully openly</text><text start="532.769" dur="6.42">honestly and feel trust in that their</text><text start="535.86" dur="5.279">sense making is going to be radically</text><text start="539.189" dur="4.08">curtailed right to what they can just do</text><text start="541.139" dur="4.44">on their own and without anybody&apos;s</text><text start="543.269" dur="9.091">ability to help error correct them with</text><text start="545.579" dur="10.13">full sharing also one of the sources of</text><text start="552.36" dur="6.87">bias is identifying with what I believe</text><text start="555.709" dur="4.721">because it because I&apos;m identifying with</text><text start="559.23" dur="4.979">part of an in-group that believes that</text><text start="560.43" dur="6.149">thing or because I am special or smart</text><text start="564.209" dur="6.471">or right or whatever for believing that</text><text start="566.579" dur="6.93">thing said the the impulse to be right</text><text start="570.68" dur="6.099">means that I won&apos;t seek to understand</text><text start="573.509" dur="6.961">other perspectives and so if I&apos;m gonna</text><text start="576.779" dur="5.16">actually seek to understand the truth</text><text start="580.47" dur="4.979">value in other perspectives like</text><text start="581.939" dur="5.791">earnestly trying to get what they are</text><text start="585.449" dur="5.76">seeing what where they&apos;re coming from I</text><text start="587.73" dur="5.099">have to stop seeing it the way that I&apos;m</text><text start="591.209" dur="5.24">seeing it for a little while and I also</text><text start="592.829" dur="6.0">have to completely suspend debate and</text><text start="596.449" dur="4.51">narrative warfare and the impulse to be</text><text start="598.829" dur="6.411">right and all of that and so there is a</text><text start="600.959" dur="8.37">deeper human connection that&apos;s involved</text><text start="605.24" dur="7.209">there&apos;s also something there&apos;s a</text><text start="609.329" dur="6.74">psychological process that almost seems</text><text start="612.449" dur="5.611">like a spiritual process where for me to</text><text start="616.069" dur="4.781">really try and get where you&apos;re coming</text><text start="618.06" dur="5.43">from on a topic I have to really take</text><text start="620.85" dur="4.26">your perspective well what is it in me</text><text start="623.49" dur="4.23">that is taking your perspective cuz it&apos;s</text><text start="625.11" dur="4.199">not my perspective right it it is</text><text start="627.72" dur="3.599">actually having to drop the way that I</text><text start="629.309" dur="3.45">see things to really try and see it the</text><text start="631.319" dur="4.111">way that you see things to make sense of</text><text start="632.759" dur="4.291">it so that means that it is some come if</text><text start="635.43" dur="3.659">there&apos;s a capacity in me that can</text><text start="637.05" dur="4.979">witness my perspective it can also</text><text start="639.089" dur="5.25">witness your perspective but it is</text><text start="642.029" dur="3.93">deeper than the current perspective I</text><text start="644.339" dur="2.85">have and we all know we can change our</text><text start="645.959" dur="3.81">beliefs and there&apos;s still something that</text><text start="647.189" dur="4.861">is us so there is a us Ness that is</text><text start="649.769" dur="3.81">deeper than the belief system to be able</text><text start="652.05" dur="2.67">to really try to make sense of someone</text><text start="653.579" dur="3.331">else I actually have to</text><text start="654.72" dur="5.27">move into that level of self that is</text><text start="656.91" dur="3.08">deeper than belief systems</text></transcript>
