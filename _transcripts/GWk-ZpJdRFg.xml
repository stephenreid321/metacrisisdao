dur="4.05">started in Minneapolis and then went to</text><text start="7.919" dur="5.1">Atlanta and Seattle and then everywhere</text><text start="10.23" dur="5.55">in the US it&apos;s interesting how consuming</text><text start="13.019" dur="4.081">a new cycle can make the most concerning</text><text start="15.78" dur="4.71">issue of three days ago almost</text><text start="17.1" dur="6.54">completely absent in people&apos;s minds and</text><text start="20.49" dur="4.799">attention but you also lose almost all</text><text start="23.64" dur="4.139">perspective if that happens so it&apos;s</text><text start="25.289" dur="4.23">important to kind of pay attention to</text><text start="27.779" dur="2.82">the sequence of things and the narrative</text><text start="29.519" dur="5.13">arc and the things that are not</text><text start="30.599" dur="7.561">forefront in the attention cycle so</text><text start="34.649" dur="6.331">right before the racial violence became</text><text start="38.16" dur="5.43">forefront we were seeing in the US and</text><text start="40.98" dur="4.86">escalation towards violence there was</text><text start="43.59" dur="5.1">very left-right oriented between red</text><text start="45.84" dur="4.379">state blue state having different focus</text><text start="48.69" dur="3.45">around how they were going to open and</text><text start="50.219" dur="4.801">it was kind of showing up as the mask</text><text start="52.14" dur="6.93">wears versus the non mask wears and we</text><text start="55.02" dur="9.779">saw armed people going to Capitol</text><text start="59.07" dur="9.72">buildings in protest of quarantine and</text><text start="64.799" dur="7.5">shut down we also started to see an</text><text start="68.79" dur="7.619">increase in racial focus in the news</text><text start="72.299" dur="8.881">over the week leading up to the case in</text><text start="76.409" dur="9.5">Minneapolis that set it all off and I&apos;m</text><text start="81.18" dur="7.35">not gonna say like a single narrative of</text><text start="85.909" dur="4.361">some central command and control</text><text start="88.53" dur="2.85">function that I think is orchestrating</text><text start="90.27" dur="2.7">everything but I&apos;m gonna mention</text><text start="91.38" dur="5.82">anomalies that I think you should be</text><text start="92.97" dur="8.18">paying attention to so we see the case</text><text start="97.2" dur="6.75">of the man who was jogging and the</text><text start="101.15" dur="7.62">retired cop and his son shot him that</text><text start="103.95" dur="8.16">was like a week before and then we see</text><text start="108.77" dur="5.379">increased news of white supremacy and a</text><text start="112.11" dur="7.71">lot more images of white guys with guns</text><text start="114.149" dur="7.441">at Capitol buildings then we see in</text><text start="119.82" dur="4.49">relationship to the guy who was running</text><text start="121.59" dur="6.479">and got shot and there were protests</text><text start="124.31" dur="5.949">black open carry of weapons associated</text><text start="128.069" dur="4.981">with the protests and then also black</text><text start="130.259" dur="8.581">open carry of weapons taking</text><text start="133.05" dur="9.269">escorting a black lawmaker to the</text><text start="138.84" dur="6.729">courthouse or some state building and</text><text start="142.319" dur="5.5">then we see Joe Biden&apos;s comments about</text><text start="145.569" dur="5.78">you ain&apos;t black and like just a whole</text><text start="147.819" dur="9.571">bunch of increase in race attention in</text><text start="151.349" dur="8.651">primary news cycles and then we see the</text><text start="157.39" dur="4.98">case with George Floyd so there&apos;s a big</text><text start="160.0" dur="7.099">question for me of like did we just have</text><text start="162.37" dur="7.979">a particular unusually racist week or</text><text start="167.099" dur="4.931">does the new cycle not actually reflect</text><text start="170.349" dur="9.45">the background rate of things for other</text><text start="172.03" dur="9.959">reasons and for it for every situation</text><text start="179.799" dur="6.66">like we see with George Floyd the number</text><text start="181.989" dur="6.241">of those that aren&apos;t caught like it&apos;s</text><text start="186.459" dur="3.571">just um it&apos;s just a much less rare</text><text start="188.23" dur="4.649">phenomena than I think most people think</text><text start="190.03" dur="4.2">it is sadly I think most black people in</text><text start="192.879" dur="8.311">inner cities know it&apos;s not as rare a</text><text start="194.23" dur="9.96">phenomena so then we see the video</text><text start="201.19" dur="5.82">circulating that the we see this guy</text><text start="204.19" dur="4.59">with a hammer and black tactical gear</text><text start="207.01" dur="5.039">breaking the windows of the autozone</text><text start="208.78" dur="5.85">right in Minneapolis and we see people</text><text start="212.049" dur="7.831">jumping to thinking assessing that he&apos;s</text><text start="214.63" dur="8.34">a cop as an agent provocateur or that he</text><text start="219.88" dur="4.68">is a antifa guy or a white supremacist</text><text start="222.97" dur="4.56">or a Soros agent there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="224.56" dur="4.829">different hypotheses but a lot of images</text><text start="227.53" dur="3.69">are surfacing of the buildings being set</text><text start="229.389" dur="5.701">on fire and the windows being broken by</text><text start="231.22" dur="7.56">white people at the black protest</text><text start="235.09" dur="6.03">rallies that were not breaking like me</text><text start="238.78" dur="3.78">and the initial movement to property</text><text start="241.12" dur="3.75">destruction and violence was not</text><text start="242.56" dur="5.94">actually then and broken windows theory</text><text start="244.87" dur="6.0">is very clear that once like who ones</text><text start="248.5" dur="5.549">the first Molotov cocktails thrown and</text><text start="250.87" dur="5.13">it becomes much easier to engage in</text><text start="254.049" dur="4.59">throwing Molotov cocktails once the</text><text start="256.0" dur="6.0">first windows are broken because there&apos;s</text><text start="258.639" dur="6.991">like a threshold to move past that that</text><text start="262.0" dur="4.569">has already been broken and so the idea</text><text start="265.63" dur="3.59">that</text><text start="266.569" dur="7.211">police officers or people with other</text><text start="269.22" dur="6.449">agendas infiltrate a protest group that</text><text start="273.78" dur="4.979">is otherwise peaceful and throw the</text><text start="275.669" dur="4.59">first rock to justify use of police</text><text start="278.759" dur="4.141">force on the other side like that&apos;s a</text><text start="280.259" dur="4.65">very well-known phenomenon but right now</text><text start="282.9" dur="3.359">we can hypothesize a lot of groups that</text><text start="284.909" dur="3.63">would have a motive to do it for a lot</text><text start="286.259" dur="3.78">of reasons so some people either are</text><text start="288.539" dur="3.421">buying the standard narrative or they&apos;re</text><text start="290.039" dur="3.75">too quickly jumping to the alternate</text><text start="291.96" dur="3.9">narrative of it was the cop for this</text><text start="293.789" dur="5.271">reason or it was the white supremacists</text><text start="295.86" dur="7.35">trying to blame the black guys or it was</text><text start="299.06" dur="5.8">the deep state Hillary Clinton Joe Biden</text><text start="303.21" dur="5.1">supporting liberals that are trying to</text><text start="304.86" dur="5.01">create incite more reason to have people</text><text start="308.31" dur="4.02">stay at home than the quarantine already</text><text start="309.87" dur="3.87">was to move towards their goal to steal</text><text start="312.33" dur="7.41">an election there&apos;s like a gazillion</text><text start="313.74" dur="8.519">hypotheses I think the problem is the</text><text start="319.74" dur="4.229">people who aren&apos;t buying the mainstream</text><text start="322.259" dur="3.451">media narrative are buying the first</text><text start="323.969" dur="4.44">alternate narrative that appeals to</text><text start="325.71" dur="4.579">their sense making desire to not have</text><text start="328.409" dur="4.44">uncertainty and put the pieces together</text><text start="330.289" dur="4.0">before there&apos;s adequate evidence that</text><text start="332.849" dur="6.0">that alternate narrative is actually</text><text start="334.289" dur="8.31">much better so the guy who broke the</text><text start="338.849" dur="6.031">windows was definitely not a normal part</text><text start="342.599" dur="6.981">of the protest but I don&apos;t know who he</text><text start="344.88" dur="7.83">was an agent for or what the motive was</text><text start="349.58" dur="4.72">because the data that suggests any of</text><text start="352.71" dur="4.88">the 10 different hypotheses are not</text><text start="354.3" dur="6.45">solid yet so one of the things I&apos;m</text><text start="357.59" dur="5.5">wanting to encourage is don&apos;t let your</text><text start="360.75" dur="4.319">attention cycle be controlled by the</text><text start="363.09" dur="4.68">attention cycle of your social media</text><text start="365.069" dur="5.31">feed or your mainstream news that&apos;s one</text><text start="367.77" dur="7.109">thing the other thing is be very careful</text><text start="370.379" dur="6.481">about how easy it is to get induced into</text><text start="374.879" dur="4.65">being on one side of groupthink and</text><text start="376.86" dur="5.489">conflict theory let&apos;s talk about</text><text start="379.529" dur="5.521">conflict theory for a moment it&apos;s</text><text start="382.349" dur="6.211">there&apos;s a few types of natural cleaving</text><text start="385.05" dur="6.03">x&apos; or easy cleaving Ziff not natural</text><text start="388.56" dur="5.31">where it&apos;s very easy to drive conflict</text><text start="391.08" dur="4.74">between people political left-right is a</text><text start="393.87" dur="4.919">very easy one you can do red state blue</text><text start="395.82" dur="3.54">state stuff you can do they have a make</text><text start="398.789" dur="4.41">America</text><text start="399.36" dur="5.579">again hat versus a rainbow gay flag at</text><text start="403.199" dur="4.65">like they&apos;re they&apos;re literally wearing</text><text start="404.939" dur="4.771">flags of different kinds to symbolize</text><text start="407.849" dur="3.87">red shirt blue shirt right like the type</text><text start="409.71" dur="4.65">type of team they&apos;re in and then you can</text><text start="411.719" dur="5.7">drive conflict between them which both</text><text start="414.36" dur="5.1">creates a sense of clear sense making of</text><text start="417.419" dur="4.71">I know who my team is I know what my</text><text start="419.46" dur="8.04">might the group think of the narrative</text><text start="422.129" dur="8.421">on my side it is and so red blue is very</text><text start="427.5" dur="6.09">easy people versus the cops is very easy</text><text start="430.55" dur="6.339">race issues are very easy races may be</text><text start="433.59" dur="9.689">the easiest because it&apos;s where the flag</text><text start="436.889" dur="9.68">is biologically built-in if everybody</text><text start="443.279" dur="5.67">here has not studied conflict theory</text><text start="446.569" dur="4.301">you&apos;re gonna have a hard time making</text><text start="448.949" dur="4.53">sense of the world without a good model</text><text start="450.87" dur="4.889">of how conflict arises between people</text><text start="453.479" dur="4.321">how it gets intentionally stirred up how</text><text start="455.759" dur="4.56">people resolve it and there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="457.8" dur="5.76">difference schools of conflicts area</text><text start="460.319" dur="6.231">that are worth studying but at a minimum</text><text start="463.56" dur="9.779">everybody should know Rene Gerard&apos;s work</text><text start="466.55" dur="9.01">and I&apos;m not saying that I agree with</text><text start="473.339" dur="7.411">Gerard there are things that he said</text><text start="475.56" dur="7.699">that we&apos;re extremely insightful so</text><text start="480.75" dur="6.509">specifically his idea is that the</text><text start="483.259" dur="7.351">fundamental nature of conflicts comes</text><text start="487.259" dur="7.65">from the fact that desire is mimetic</text><text start="490.61" dur="5.979">meaning that we learn to want stuff the</text><text start="494.909" dur="4.41">same way we learn language by watching</text><text start="496.589" dur="5.431">other people and that I don&apos;t know</text><text start="499.319" dur="4.111">Mandarin and I don&apos;t know so he Lee and</text><text start="502.02" dur="2.639">I don&apos;t know Dutch because I didn&apos;t</text><text start="503.43" dur="3.12">watch people speaking those I watch</text><text start="504.659" dur="4.081">people speak in English so I got</text><text start="506.55" dur="4.859">conditioned to think in a world view</text><text start="508.74" dur="5.099">through aesthetic frames through like</text><text start="511.409" dur="4.591">it&apos;s very deep how much my whole</text><text start="513.839" dur="4.471">identity and everything was conditioned</text><text start="516.0" dur="4.829">by what I watched so his arguments is</text><text start="518.31" dur="6.69">that much of what we want is also</text><text start="520.829" dur="6.271">conditioned by watching people and so we</text><text start="525.0" dur="4.89">end up in Nate Lee wanting what other</text><text start="527.1" dur="4.859">people have which means that desire and</text><text start="529.89" dur="2.97">extra Blee drives conflict somebody</text><text start="531.959" dur="2.701">people</text><text start="532.86" dur="4.89">have stuff you want that thing more</text><text start="534.66" dur="4.77">similar kinds of things then as more</text><text start="537.75" dur="3.69">people are wanting the same things and</text><text start="539.43" dur="4.469">conflicting over it the conflict itself</text><text start="541.44" dur="5.91">becomes mimetic people learn through</text><text start="543.899" dur="5.221">mimesis to identify with the zionist or</text><text start="547.35" dur="3.75">the anti-zionist side based on which</text><text start="549.12" dur="4.11">side of the wall they grew up on or the</text><text start="551.1" dur="4.58">you know whatever the conflict they</text><text start="553.23" dur="5.7">happen to have been born into and then</text><text start="555.68" dur="5.02">in Gerard&apos;s model the conflict continues</text><text start="558.93" dur="4.5">to increase until there&apos;s so much</text><text start="560.7" dur="4.56">embodied energy that you&apos;re gonna get</text><text start="563.43" dur="3.719">something like a war and the least</text><text start="565.26" dur="5.28">violent way to deal with it is to have a</text><text start="567.149" dur="5.88">scapegoat a sacrificial rather than a</text><text start="570.54" dur="5.0">all against all war be able to have some</text><text start="573.029" dur="5.041">sacrificial person that everybody gets</text><text start="575.54" dur="5.2">that is able to be effectively blamed</text><text start="578.07" dur="4.829">for the whole scenario and then we&apos;re</text><text start="580.74" dur="3.839">able to take them out and decrease the</text><text start="582.899" dur="8.94">embodied conflict energy for a while</text><text start="584.579" dur="11.13">then the cycle has to repeat jords work</text><text start="591.839" dur="5.701">really says that there is no there</text><text start="595.709" dur="4.771">historically has been no way out of that</text><text start="597.54" dur="5.85">and the role of various religions was to</text><text start="600.48" dur="5.13">figure out how to do scapegoating well</text><text start="603.39" dur="3.84">and that that&apos;s what all of the</text><text start="605.61" dur="5.19">sacrifices of various religious</text><text start="607.23" dur="5.219">traditions were about that Christianity</text><text start="610.8" dur="3.779">was actually trying to get rid of</text><text start="612.449" dur="4.441">scapegoating by showing the person they</text><text start="614.579" dur="4.401">scapegoated was actually innocent - not</text><text start="616.89" dur="4.559">only innocent with the highest kind of</text><text start="618.98" dur="5.799">innocence so that the way people would</text><text start="621.449" dur="4.89">get out of his answer actually of how</text><text start="624.779" dur="5.911">you get out of scapegoating was everyone</text><text start="626.339" dur="6.391">developed christ-like virtues but</text><text start="630.69" dur="3.81">specifically as critique said that by</text><text start="632.73" dur="3.419">getting rid of religion and this is</text><text start="634.5" dur="9.48">relevant to the goals of this group that</text><text start="636.149" dur="10.021">is trying to reinvent of human virtue by</text><text start="643.98" dur="4.56">getting rid of religion we got rid of</text><text start="646.17" dur="6.21">the way of dealing with the mimetic</text><text start="648.54" dur="5.989">conflict while simultaneously getting</text><text start="652.38" dur="5.459">much much larger weapons of destruction</text><text start="654.529" dur="5.92">so that rather than have things heat up</text><text start="657.839" dur="4.681">in Europe and kill a Jew sacrificially</text><text start="660.449" dur="6.711">it had to be this massive kind of</text><text start="662.52" dur="4.64">killing of all of these Jews and so</text><text start="667.73" dur="4.23">okay so why am i bringing that up I</text><text start="676.28" dur="6.07">think it&apos;s very easy to I think there</text><text start="679.77" dur="7.5">are lots of reasons to want to drive</text><text start="682.35" dur="7.65">conflict and to want to keep groups of</text><text start="687.27" dur="4.92">people having attention focused in</text><text start="690.0" dur="6.05">different ways maybe this is actually</text><text start="692.19" dur="3.86">the way I&apos;ll talk about it</text><text start="696.32" dur="6.73">power pretty much translates to power</text><text start="699.3" dur="5.55">over other people to have power over</text><text start="703.05" dur="4.5">their behaviors whether I want people to</text><text start="704.85" dur="4.74">vote for me in a particular way or I</text><text start="707.55" dur="4.92">want them to buy my stuff or I want them</text><text start="709.59" dur="4.41">to publicly support my ideas I need to</text><text start="712.47" dur="2.91">control other people&apos;s behavior to</text><text start="714.0" dur="8.72">control their behavior I need to control</text><text start="715.38" dur="10.32">their minds and so warfare is main</text><text start="722.72" dur="4.72">mainly not fought with bullets like the</text><text start="725.7" dur="4.17">kinetic warfare that we think of as</text><text start="727.44" dur="6.6">warfare that&apos;s fought with weapons is</text><text start="729.87" dur="6.12">maybe 1% of warfare 99% of warfare is</text><text start="734.04" dur="4.11">diplomatic warfare political warfare</text><text start="735.99" dur="4.68">economic warfare narrative warfare</text><text start="738.15" dur="4.86">information warfare all of this comes</text><text start="740.67" dur="5.25">together to what we call hybrid warfare</text><text start="743.01" dur="7.41">or really just politics or game theory</text><text start="745.92" dur="9.24">or the game of power but but think of it</text><text start="750.42" dur="5.99">as high hybrid or population centric</text><text start="755.16" dur="6.87">warfare</text><text start="756.41" dur="7.78">so in this war the treasure being

start="1575.429" dur="8.7">disturbed it&apos;s much easier to have new</text><text start="1577.47" dur="9.569">things come in and change the process so</text><text start="1584.129" dur="5.28">if we go through and look at all of the</text><text start="1587.039" dur="4.27">areas where there are major problems and</text><text start="1589.409" dur="4.48">where there are major risks and</text><text start="1591.309" dur="4.23">say what is the system that&apos;s actually</text><text start="1593.889" dur="3.66">breaking down and what would a better</text><text start="1595.539" dur="4.291">version of that system be and what could</text><text start="1597.549" dur="3.901">we do to implement those better versions</text><text start="1599.83" dur="3.449">of the system rather than try to</text><text start="1601.45" dur="4.049">reinstate the security of the old ones</text><text start="1603.279" dur="5.041">that would be a beginning of thinking</text><text start="1605.499" dur="4.621">about the opportunity space and we could</text><text start="1608.32" dur="3.059">talk about that with global finance we</text><text start="1610.12" dur="2.37">could talk about it with infrastructure</text><text start="1611.379" dur="3.63">we could talk about it with the</text><text start="1612.49" dur="6.5">healthcare system on and on write the</text><text start="1615.009" dur="6.091">judicial reform all those things and</text><text start="1618.99" dur="5.22">someone just posted this in the chat and</text><text start="1621.1" dur="5.909">I think it&apos;s really true so far it seems</text><text

start="1638.039" dur="7.26">sense of of how that process might play</text><text start="1643.059" dur="12.12">out and where where&apos;s the sort of hope</text><text start="1645.299" dur="17.561">in that if there is any most people who</text><text start="1655.179" dur="10.531">care about things widely care about the</text><text start="1662.86" dur="8.309">global Commons long term suck at doing</text><text start="1665.71" dur="8.61">things like they suck at doing things at</text><text start="1671.169" dur="5.041">scale because most anyone is good at</text><text start="1674.32" dur="5.01">doing things at scale one at the game of</text><text start="1676.21" dur="5.939">power because to do things at scale</text><text start="1679.33" dur="6.75">means to be able to influence things in</text><text start="1682.149" dur="5.701">a way that will beat out competitors and</text><text start="1686.08" dur="5.939">go against people who want things to go</text><text start="1687.85" dur="6.179">otherwise so right now there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="1692.019" dur="3.181">people dirt like during the Cova time</text><text start="1694.029" dur="4.38">there&apos;s a lot of people feeling like</text><text start="1695.2" dur="4.65">they have more free time than ever but</text><text start="1698.409" dur="2.97">the most powerful people in the world</text><text start="1699.85" dur="4.5">have been busier than ever during this</text><text start="1701.379" dur="6.841">time they have been consolidating the</text><text start="1704.35" dur="9.959">market and

who</text><text start="1728.66" dur="6.27">actually are committed to the well-being</text><text start="1731.48" dur="6.51">of humanity and the earth and</text><text start="1734.93" dur="7.01">civilization long term must learn to be</text><text start="1737.99" dur="6.18">how must learn how to be effective at</text><text start="1741.94" dur="3.97">actually making things happen at a</text><text start="1744.17" dur="5.13">global level do you like to ask your</text><text start="1745.91" dur="7.52">question Roy yes what do you have to say</text><text start="1749.3" dur="5.9">about yes the the resource of</text><text start="1753.43" dur="5.5">cross-generational</text><text start="1755.2" dur="10.96">mentoring and networking in in the</text><text start="1758.93" dur="10.17">situation we&apos;re in it&apos;s complex it&apos;s</text><text start="1766.16" dur="5.97">easy to say mmm cross generational</text><text start="1769.1" dur="6.66">collaboration is good like it&apos;s it&apos;s</text><text start="1772.13" dur="5.7">easy to say that diverse perspectives of</text><text start="1775.76" dur="6.74">any kind being in conversation will</text><text start="1777.83" dur="4.67">enrich everyone who is there that&apos;s true</text><text start="1783.88" dur="6.46">the current situation that we&apos;re facing</text><text start="1787.54" dur="5.47">the last times we face situations that</text><text start="1790.34" dur="6.33">were relevantly analogous none of those</text><text start="1793.01" dur="5.16">people are still alive in terms of the</text><text start="1796.67" dur="3.48">generations that actually know anything</text><text start="1798.17" dur="4.08">about it like the people who were in</text><text start="1800.15" dur="3.39">World War 2 aren&apos;t still here the people</text><text start="1802.25" dur="2.4">who were in the Great Depression aren&apos;t</text><text start="1803.54" dur="3.6">still here the people who were in the</text><text start="1804.65" dur="5.49">1918 plague aren&apos;t still here and this</text><text start="1807.14" dur="5.87">is like if you study generational theory</text><text start="1810.14" dur="5.43">like Straus how or you study Baudrillard</text><text start="1813.01" dur="4.27">typically things repeat on the cycle</text><text start="1815.57" dur="3.72">that once the people who had the</text><text start="1817.28" dur="5.82">hard-won knowledge are dead we repeat</text><text start="1819.29" dur="6.72">the thing because they&apos;re gone right so</text><text start="1823.1" dur="5.04">part of the generational connection I</text><text start="1826.01" dur="4.5">want people to do is study the work of</text><text start="1828.14" dur="4.35">the people who really understood the</text><text start="1830.51" dur="3.33">last relevant issues who happened to be</text><text start="1832.49" dur="5.76">dead it might have been alive a little</text><text start="1833.84" dur="10.08">while now there are still people who</text><text start="1838.25" dur="7.38">were involved in in Vietnam and the</text><text start="1843.92" dur="4.05">counterculture movement and who were</text><text start="1845.63" dur="6.35">involved in different times that are</text><text start="1847.97" dur="4.01">relevant and to discuss</text><text start="1854.45" dur="9.58">so like I have a friend mark Stallman he</text><text start="1860.49" dur="8.67">was involved during that generation but</text><text start="1864.03" dur="7.62">he was doing intelligence work and like</text><text start="1869.16" dur="6.48">he was working with Freeman Dyson</text><text start="1871.65" dur="6.9">directly regarding what was brought to</text><text start="1875.64" dur="5.49">JFK to do with Khrushchev that was a big</text><text start="1878.55" dur="4.83">part of what&apos;s led to things broke down</text><text start="1881.13" dur="5.96">there so there&apos;s knowledge that he has</text><text start="1883.38" dur="8.12">firsthand that super directly relevant</text><text start="1887.09" dur="4.41">but like when I look at the</text><text start="1892.91" dur="5.23">counterculture movement as a whole and I</text><text start="1895.89" dur="4.46">look at the Green Revolution and the</text><text start="1898.14" dur="7.05">sexual revolution and the Civil Rights</text><text start="1900.35" dur="8.74">process and the women&apos;s rights all the</text><text start="1905.19" dur="6.0">various things the deeper story that I</text><text start="1909.09" dur="5.73">see most of the activists who were there</text><text start="1911.19" dur="5.88">don&apos;t know the deeper story I see is</text><text start="1914.82" dur="5.82">like actually understanding COINTELPRO</text><text start="1917.07" dur="4.89">and how the FBI CIA and other</text><text start="1920.64" dur="7.32">intelligence agencies actually</text><text start="1921.96" dur="8.4">infiltrated the the progressive</text><text start="1927.96" dur="5.58">movements to very specifically derail</text><text start="1930.36" dur="5.28">them and get them focused on shift it</text><text start="1933.54" dur="3.11">would be an effective that is that we&apos;re</text><text start="1935.64" dur="4.71">still doing today</text><text start="1936.65" dur="6.4">so I happen to believe that there was</text><text start="1940.35" dur="4.83">intentional up regulation by those power</text><text start="1943.05" dur="6.42">structures of post-modernism as a</text><text start="1945.18" dur="6.6">structure of thought because if the</text><text start="1949.47" dur="4.05">people who studied social science only</text><text start="1951.78" dur="3.48">studied how to critique the game of</text><text start="1953.52" dur="4.02">power without actually knowing how to</text><text start="1955.26" dur="3.36">effectively organize then it would make</text><text start="1957.54" dur="4.05">sure that they never could actually</text><text start="1958.62" dur="4.5">really do anything so if every time</text><text start="1961.59" dur="5.04">someone&apos;s organizing well you call it</text><text start="1963.12" dur="5.61">imperialism you won&apos;t end up organizing</text><text start="1966.63" dur="7.41">well becoming an imperialist so you&apos;ll</text><text start="1968.73" dur="10.83">just be noise and that&apos;s fine and the</text><text start="1974.04" dur="7.74">social sciences that are like actually</text><text start="1979.56" dur="4.83">studying the history of military theory</text><text start="1981.78" dur="3.75">and political theory and and strategy</text><text start="1984.39" dur="4.14">itself</text><text start="1985.53" dur="5.55">got very downregulated in exchange for</text><text start="1988.53" dur="4.17">something that would make people feel</text><text start="1991.08" dur="7.71">more righteous while being less</text><text start="1992.7" dur="7.92">effective and so I want to make sure</text><text start="1998.79" dur="8.82">that we&apos;re learning the right lessons</text><text start="2000.62" dur="8.67">from the right periods of history so</text><text start="2007.61" dur="3.9">what I would say is that when I think</text><text start="2009.29" dur="5.1">about generations and I take all the</text><text start="2011.51" dur="6.57">generations that are alive now I would</text><text start="2014.39" dur="6.12">say that 99% of the people in all those</text><text start="2018.08" dur="4.8">generations have been the victims of</text><text start="2020.51" dur="3.87">intentional disinformation and a mostly</text><text start="2022.88" dur="3.48">just all confused so we can have</text><text start="2024.38" dur="5.91">intergenerational sharing of some</text><text start="2026.36" dur="5.01">confused generations with others it&apos;s</text><text start="2030.29" dur="6.93">still nice to have different</text><text start="2031.37" dur="8.19">perspectives but I would mostly like for</text><text start="2037.22" dur="5.1">people to have more clear and incisive</text><text start="2039.56" dur="4.59">insight at all and across a longer time</text><text start="2042.32" dur="3.78">period than their own experience a</text><text start="2044.15" dur="3.69">deeper study of history and like that</text><text start="2046.1" dur="3.36">so I was just wondering what you know</text><text start="2047.84" dur="3.26">where you feel stuck and you feel like</text><text start="2049.46" dur="6.12">you&apos;re kind of in a hopeless situation</text><text start="2051.1" dur="8.74">making space for grief so emotions of</text><text start="2055.58" dur="5.849">all kind can influence our sense making</text><text start="2059.84" dur="8.819">they can also influence our choice</text><text start="2061.429" dur="10.141">making I want we all know what it&apos;s like</text><text start="2068.659" dur="4.921">to have emotions that are not being</text><text start="2071.57" dur="6.66">clearly processed influenced our choice</text><text start="2073.58" dur="11.579">making in damaging ways right reacting</text><text start="2078.23" dur="9.36">out of anger or whatever but then we can</text><text start="2085.159" dur="4.801">also say ok so I don&apos;t want to be</text><text start="2087.59" dur="5.67">reactive emotionally so I&apos;m going to</text><text start="2089.96" dur="5.49">suppress emotions and pretend to do like</text><text start="2093.26" dur="4.98">do a bad version of Stoicism</text><text start="2095.45" dur="6.78">and just numb down emotional</text><text start="2098.24" dur="7.49">intelligence in which case I&apos;m taking</text><text start="2102.23" dur="6.03">one whole type of information one whole</text><text start="2105.73" dur="8.62">way of sense making and turning it off</text><text start="2108.26" dur="7.89">and you could call emotion um this is</text><text start="2114.35" dur="4.02">reductive but I&apos;m just saying one lens</text><text start="2116.15" dur="2.94">you could call emotion a way of being</text><text start="2118.37" dur="7.35">able to read</text><text start="2119.09" dur="8.82">data partly our emotion is responding to</text><text start="2125.72" dur="3.93">the situation partly our emotion is</text><text start="2127.91" dur="4.02">responding to the narrative we make of</text><text start="2129.65" dur="3.69">the situation so in terms of the</text><text start="2131.93" dur="3.69">narrative we make
