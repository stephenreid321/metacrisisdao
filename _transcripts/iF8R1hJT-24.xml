dur="9.199">discussing here is that when people are</text><text start="11.7" dur="7.77">communicating with other people in</text><text start="14.089" dur="7.231">person or via some kind of media what is</text><text start="19.47" dur="4.95">the basis of why they&apos;re communicating</text><text start="21.32" dur="5.289">what is the actual motive or agenda or</text><text start="24.42" dur="4.5">ordinay ting basis of that communication</text><text start="26.609" dur="3.901">because it&apos;s a it is a shared thing</text><text start="28.92" dur="3.359">there&apos;s an interpersonal thing happening</text><text start="30.51" dur="4.02">is the communication for the</text><text start="32.279" dur="4.62">interpersonal benefit for the benefit of</text><text start="34.53" dur="3.36">those people and the whole the larger</text><text start="36.899" dur="3.301">holes that they&apos;re part of in the</text><text start="37.89" dur="4.53">ecology whatever is it for some private</text><text start="40.2" dur="6.48">benefit is the motive being shared is it</text><text start="42.42" dur="7.56">not being shared these are important</text><text start="46.68" dur="6.12">inquiries and humans are smart and we</text><text start="49.98" dur="4.14">have a world where there are ways where</text><text start="52.8" dur="3.239">we can advantage ourselves at the</text><text start="54.12" dur="5.64">expense of others there are ways where</text><text start="56.039" dur="5.43">the expense to other can be hidden so we</text><text start="59.76" dur="3.479">have plausible deniability on it or</text><text start="61.469" dur="3.66">seems diffuse to a lot of people so it</text><text start="63.239" dur="3.42">doesn&apos;t seem that bad or seems</text><text start="65.129" dur="3.631">rationalize a bowl because if I don&apos;t</text><text start="66.659" dur="3.871">some other bad thing will happen so</text><text start="68.76" dur="3.39">there&apos;s a lot of reasons why someone can</text><text start="70.53" dur="3.72">even feel moral and right by doing</text><text start="72.15" dur="4.5">something to be self-serving that</text><text start="74.25" dur="4.92">involves sharing something that is to</text><text start="76.65" dur="4.259">some degree distorted meaning not true</text><text start="79.17" dur="3.69">or not the whole truth out in a</text><text start="80.909" dur="4.231">representative way or whatever I don&apos;t</text><text start="82.86" dur="3.99">think the history on this is clear I</text><text start="85.14" dur="6.45">think there&apos;s still a good bit of debate</text><text start="86.85" dur="6.78">on theories of it Gelman and gerard and</text><text start="91.59" dur="3.15">you know various thinkers on the history</text><text start="93.63" dur="3.39">of linguistics have different thoughts</text><text start="94.74" dur="6.12">on the evolution of spoken language and</text><text start="97.02" dur="6.87">you know then for mobilizations of</text><text start="100.86" dur="5.43">spoken language but I think it&apos;s pretty</text><text start="103.89" dur="5.22">clear that language did not evolve just</text><text start="106.29" dur="6.18">based on individual selection it was</text><text start="109.11" dur="5.009">that groups survived better based on</text><text start="112.47" dur="3.66">their ability to share information and</text><text start="114.119" dur="3.871">coordinate better I eat to share sense</text><text start="116.13" dur="3.36">making I went and I saw where the</text><text start="117.99" dur="2.85">predator was or where the berries were</text><text start="119.49" dur="3.479">where the water was and I come back and</text><text start="120.84" dur="3.66">share so the ability for the people to</text><text start="122.969" dur="2.94">share their sense making and then to be</text><text start="124.5" dur="3.03">able to coordinate that has a group</text><text start="125.909" dur="3.361">intelligence that is better than just</text><text start="127.53" dur="3.81">the individual intelligences their</text><text start="129.27" dur="3.329">ability to communicate created groups</text><text start="131.34" dur="2.58">that survive better so than those</text><text start="132.599" dur="3.061">individuals that did</text><text start="133.92" dur="3.48">if communication within groups did so</text><text start="135.66" dur="3.57">it&apos;s a group selection far more than an</text><text start="137.4" dur="4.23">individual selection phenomenon which</text><text start="139.23" dur="4.11">means that the evolution of language was</text><text start="141.63" dur="3.689">actually for the survival of the group</text><text start="143.34" dur="5.19">this is something that forests as</text><text start="145.319" dur="9.241">Landry&apos;s done a lot of work on and yet</text><text start="148.53" dur="8.4">today we share communication very often</text><text start="154.56" dur="4.62">in self-serving ways not for the benefit</text><text start="156.93" dur="6.24">of the group but for the benefit of self</text><text start="159.18" dur="7.02">or self and some proxy some fealty</text><text start="163.17" dur="5.789">relationships like family or political</text><text start="166.2" dur="4.83">side or company or nation or whatever it</text><text start="168.959" dur="5.581">is but that&apos;s still self and group I</text><text start="171.03" dur="4.89">identify with in context of externalize</text><text start="174.54" dur="7.41">harm to some other group that&apos;s also</text><text start="175.92" dur="7.95">connected to our context but even just</text><text start="181.95" dur="3.66">in personal relationships and if you</text><text start="183.87" dur="5.61">just look on Facebook the amount of</text><text start="185.61" dur="5.61">sharing that is self serving in through</text><text start="189.48" dur="3.39">language when I think language actually</text><text start="191.22" dur="5.22">evolved as a collective intelligence</text><text start="192.87" dur="6.27">tool is a real underlying fundamental</text><text start="196.44" dur="4.56">problem and I think then to the degree</text><text start="199.14" dur="3.84">we do it it leads to everyone doing it</text><text start="201.0" dur="3.84">leads to a multipolar trap that leads to</text><text start="202.98" dur="3.509">a broken epistemic Commons and</text><text start="204.84" dur="3.66">information ecology where almost nobody</text><text start="206.489" dur="3.631">actually trusts anyone or thinks really</text><text start="208.5" dur="3.69">well or communicates in earnest</text><text start="210.12" dur="4.11">effective shift that empowers each other</text><text start="212.19" dur="3.93">I would like when I&apos;m communicating to</text><text start="214.23" dur="3.36">share things that actually empower you</text><text start="216.12" dur="3.27">to be more sovereign not to try to</text><text start="217.59" dur="4.519">capture your sovereignty so that you</text><text start="219.39" dur="8.49">believe in do in service of what I want</text><text start="222.109" dur="8.461">right and I think I think the reason</text><text start="227.88" dur="5.37">that we&apos;re sharing these videos is</text><text start="230.57" dur="5.11">actually not trying to say this is my</text><text start="233.25" dur="4.319">worldview believe it but to say this is</text><text start="235.68" dur="3.45">the way that anyone selling a worldview</text><text start="237.569" dur="4.861">including where I&apos;m selling worldviews</text><text start="239.13" dur="6.15">in other places can have distortion</text><text start="242.43" dur="4.77">intentionally or unintentionally so how</text><text start="245.28" dur="3.87">do you better equip yourself to notice</text><text start="247.2" dur="3.8">that included including the worldviews</text><text start="249.15" dur="3.75">that we&apos;re selling to ourselves</text><text start="251.0" dur="4.42">including the worldviews were selling to</text><text start="252.9" dur="5.519">ourselves and yeah like the distortion</text><text start="255.42" dur="5.43">is to self most of the time and that&apos;s</text><text start="258.419" dur="4.111">actually why I said one of the things</text><text start="260.85" dur="3.33">that good sense-making requires it a lot</text><text start="262.53" dur="4.53">more courage but also a lot more</text><text start="264.18" dur="7.89">humility because</text><text start="267.06" dur="9.12">one of the main problems is faulty</text><text start="272.07" dur="7.02">overconfidence and then there is a</text><text start="276.18" dur="6.84">failure on the other side which is to</text><text start="279.09" dur="5.76">simply embrace not confidence but give</text><text start="283.02" dur="3.03">up on sense making I got no idea what</text><text start="284.85" dur="3.9">the going on and playing video</text><text start="286.05" dur="4.23">games or I got no idea what&apos;s true so</text><text start="288.75" dur="3.09">I&apos;m gonna vote for a strong man leader</text><text start="290.28" dur="4.68">that I think will at least protect me</text><text start="291.84" dur="9.0">and more right so we can see the number</text><text start="294.96" dur="8.1">of Russian citizens that say that they</text><text start="300.84" dur="4.62">think Putin is lying even to them in the</text><text start="303.06" dur="4.2">news but also still support him because</text><text start="305.46" dur="4.019">they don&apos;t think that truth is a</text><text start="307.26" dur="5.07">possibility and that a good strong</text><text start="309.479" dur="4.651">politician facing huge opponents and</text><text start="312.33" dur="4.47">enemies like the West has to lie and</text><text start="314.13" dur="4.47">they at least think that he&apos;s going to</text><text start="316.8" dur="3.089">keep them safe and serve their interests</text><text start="318.6" dur="4.379">better than some other people wouldn&apos;t</text><text start="319.889" dur="5.521">and so you can see there as when</text><text start="322.979" dur="4.171">people&apos;s epistemic certainty is low and</text><text start="325.41" dur="3.99">they don&apos;t know how to make good choices</text><text start="327.15" dur="4.2">for themselves or what&apos;s true they start</text><text start="329.4" dur="5.24">defecting to wanting strongman leaders</text><text start="331.35" dur="6.81">more we see this in the u.s. right now</text><text start="334.64" dur="5.74">you can also see that because strongman</text><text start="338.16" dur="4.17">leaders know that helping to decrease</text><text start="340.38" dur="5.22">everyone&apos;s epistemic certainty is</text><text start="342.33" dur="5.03">actually in their interest and that will</text><text start="345.6" dur="4.77">always lead in the direction of</text><text start="347.36" dur="6.4">dictatorship towards despotism and if we</text><text start="350.37" dur="5.1">want anything like a more democratic or</text><text start="353.76" dur="3.629">more Republic process where more people</text><text start="355.47" dur="3.509">are engaged in their own governance they</text><text start="357.389" dur="3.571">have to do the sense-making to be able</text><text start="358.979" dur="4.581">to meaningfully engage with other people</text><text start="360.96" dur="9.6">that they are going to be bound with and</text><text start="363.56" dur="8.95">if you you know if you don&apos;t want to and</text><text start="370.56" dur="4.02">you don&apos;t commit to do what it takes to</text><text start="372.51" dur="4.32">be actively informed and civically</text><text start="374.58" dur="5.55">engaged then you consent to be ruled by</text><text start="376.83" dur="5.7">those who seek to rule if you are</text><text start="380.13" dur="4.83">willing to just adopt belief systems</text><text start="382.53" dur="4.109">based on who the dominant group think</text><text start="384.96" dur="4.13">closest to you that seems to serve your</text><text start="386.639" dur="5.4">interests as then you are consenting to</text><text start="389.09" dur="5.38">be ruled and to the dissent towards that</text><text start="392.039" dur="6.331">particular kind of dictatorship and if</text><text start="394.47" dur="5.939">you want something like a democratized</text><text start="398.37" dur="2.58">process democracy doesn&apos;t mean voting</text><text start="400.409" dur="2.551">its</text><text start="400.95" dur="3.57">it means a process by which more people</text><text start="402.96" dur="2.91">are engaged in their own governance of</text><text start="404.52" dur="2.64">which voting is one tool but the</text><text start="405.87" dur="3.72">founding fathers said voting is the</text><text start="407.16" dur="4.59">death of democracy I forget I think it</text><text start="409.59" dur="3.78">was Jefferson said it because the</text><text start="411.75" dur="3.57">democracy really meant can more of us</text><text start="413.37" dur="4.82">engage in better conversations than the</text><text start="415.32" dur="5.42">monarch says what happens right or the</text><text start="418.19" dur="4.63">whatever kind of rulership there is and</text><text start="420.74" dur="4.57">to the degree we have a town hall where</text><text start="422.82" dur="4.41">we have an actual good earnest dialectic</text><text start="425.31" dur="2.85">conversation we might not even need to</text><text start="427.23" dur="2.85">vote because we come up with something</text><text start="428.16" dur="4.74">where we all agree that&apos;s a good idea</text><text start="430.08" dur="5.48">and the vote is if we can&apos;t to sublimate</text><text start="432.9" dur="5.4">physical warfare with the voting warfare</text><text start="435.56" dur="4.27">right but it&apos;s actually a warfare where</text><text start="438.3" dur="2.64">some people are now actually unhappy</text><text start="439.83" dur="2.55">with the way the whole thing is moving</text><text start="440.94" dur="3.3">forward but they at least think that</text><text start="442.38" dur="4.11">still participating with that system is</text><text start="444.24" dur="3.81">better than defecting on it and going</text><text start="446.49" dur="3.38">into war so they&apos;re willing to do it and</text><text start="448.05" dur="4.77">try again in the next four years right</text><text start="449.87" dur="5.05">or whatever the next thing is but if we</text><text start="452.82" dur="4.86">want something other than despotism it</text><text start="454.92" dur="4.5">the only way to check power actually</text><text start="457.68" dur="8.85">this is an important point that I would</text><text start="459.42" dur="9.36">like to make them closing anyone who has</text><text start="466.53" dur="5.73">asymmetric power whether that&apos;s more</text><text start="468.78" dur="8.28">money or political power or cultural</text><text start="472.26" dur="6.66">influence or whatever and usually those</text><text start="477.06" dur="3.51">come together right more money also</text><text start="478.92" dur="3.99">means that I can buy cultural influence</text><text start="480.57" dur="4.14">through media and marketing and paying</text><text start="482.91" dur="3.54">other people to say things that are</text><text start="484.71" dur="3.6">aligned with what I want and being able</text><text start="486.45" dur="5.04">to pay lobbyists and campaign budgets to</text><text start="488.31" dur="5.97">get political power so we can just talk</text><text start="491.49" dur="5.7">about power itself and all of those as</text><text start="494.28" dur="5.7">expressions those who have more power</text><text start="497.19" dur="5.34">within a power asymmetry both have the</text><text start="499.98" dur="6.2">incentive and the capacity to maintain</text><text start="502.53" dur="6.87">that power asymmetry and increase it so</text><text start="506.18" dur="6.91">they have the ability to make news that</text><text start="509.4" dur="5.699">does the bidding of what that has the</text><text start="513.09" dur="5.88">populace believe things that continue to</text><text start="515.099" dur="7.081">serve them having more power in that</text><text start="518.97" dur="5.37">system they can get representation they</text><text start="522.18" dur="4.56">can
