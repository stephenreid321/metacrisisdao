-</text><text start="5.97" dur="6.72">for almost every narrative and I am</text><text start="10.86" dur="3.96">quite happy to do that so if I&apos;m</text><text start="12.69" dur="4.86">upsetting anyone I hopefully should be</text><text start="14.82" dur="5.4">upsetting everyone kind of in the equal</text><text start="17.55" dur="5.899">distribution that is doing what I think</text><text start="20.22" dur="7.319">is some degree of disingenuous narrative</text><text start="23.449" dur="6.25">confirmation so let&apos;s look at the</text><text start="27.539" dur="4.41">worldview that I would call kind of</text><text start="29.699" dur="9.411">naive techno up tomorr techno capital</text><text start="31.949" dur="10.38">optimism and we can see you know gates</text><text start="39.11" dur="7.0">Steven Pinker Hans Rosling like there&apos;s</text><text start="42.329" dur="8.611">a whole kind of underlying thinking and</text><text start="46.11" dur="6.69">so when you when you see statistics</text><text start="50.94" dur="5.13">quoted by Hans or John Mackay or</text><text start="52.8" dur="6.89">whatever that say the world is doing</text><text start="56.07" dur="7.079">better than it&apos;s ever been because in</text><text start="59.69" dur="5.74">1850 X percent of people lived on less</text><text start="63.149" dur="3.931">than a dollar fifty a day and now only</text><text start="65.43" dur="3.299">this tiny percent live on less than a</text><text start="67.08" dur="3.6">dollar fifty a day therefore abundance</text><text start="68.729" dur="4.591">is going up and that makes a better</text><text start="70.68" dur="4.74">quality of life for everyone well that</text><text start="73.32" dur="5.189">might actually be a true statistic that</text><text start="75.42" dur="4.5">it went from 60 people to 18% of people</text><text start="78.509" dur="2.461">or something I forget what the exact</text><text start="79.92" dur="4.08">statistic is that might be a true</text><text start="80.97" dur="4.98">statistic but that is misrepresentative</text><text start="84.0" dur="4.17">in some really important ways taken out</text><text start="85.95" dur="3.809">of context that in 1850 people&apos;s lives</text><text start="88.17" dur="2.519">were mediated largely not by dollars a</text><text start="89.759" dur="4.141">lot of those people who they were</text><text start="90.689" dur="5.25">talking about were lived in log cabins</text><text start="93.9" dur="4.13">that they made themselves not mediated</text><text start="95.939" dur="6.241">by dollars and grew their own food and</text><text start="98.03" dur="6.159">so the idea that dollars mediated their</text><text start="102.18" dur="5.34">life actually is not a good</text><text start="104.189" dur="6.301">representation of economic quality of</text><text start="107.52" dur="5.459">life nor is the fact that now obesity</text><text start="110.49" dur="5.64">which is mediated by you know more</text><text start="112.979" dur="5.43">dollars is a radical cause of life</text><text start="116.13" dur="3.779">expectancy challenges and all kinds of</text><text start="118.409" dur="3.361">psychological and physical issues and</text><text start="119.909" dur="4.89">it&apos;s kind of rampant a new bic witness</text><text start="121.77" dur="4.98">and you know when the story comes that</text><text start="124.799" dur="4.651">there the world has always had violence</text><text start="126.75" dur="4.709">and we&apos;re less violent now well kind of</text><text start="129.45" dur="4.26">like we&apos;re in a fairly short period of</text><text start="131.459" dur="5.701">having to be less violent of certain</text><text start="133.71" dur="5.88">kinds after developing the bomb but now</text><text start="137.16" dur="4.65">the the Bretton Woods convention that</text><text start="139.59" dur="3.18">mediated that has almost completely</text><text start="141.81" dur="4.8">broken down</text><text start="142.77" dur="5.49">we no longer have tension between two</text><text start="146.61" dur="4.23">nuclear equipped superpowers but a</text><text start="148.26" dur="3.78">multipolar situation where a force nash</text><text start="150.84" dur="3.3">equilibrium like mutually assured</text><text start="152.04" dur="3.63">destruction isn&apos;t even possible the</text><text start="154.14" dur="5.64">tensions in the situation are heat</text><text start="155.67" dur="6.66">heating and yeah we never had weaponized</text><text start="159.78" dur="5.67">AI drones before right we didn&apos;t have</text><text start="162.33" dur="5.16">CRISPR based bioweapon so like the fact</text><text start="165.45" dur="4.38">that there might be less violence of</text><text start="167.49" dur="3.81">some kinds at the moment but radically</text><text start="169.83" dur="4.02">more violence capacity and less ability</text><text start="171.3" dur="4.23">to do anything effective towards it</text><text start="173.85" dur="4.02">while orienting more towards it is a</text><text start="175.53" dur="4.14">stat that&apos;s not being or a it&apos;s not a</text><text start="177.87" dur="4.23">stat you can&apos;t even make a proper stat</text><text start="179.67" dur="4.71">on it it&apos;s a trendline that isn&apos;t being</text><text start="182.1" dur="4.41">paid attention to nor is the radical</text><text start="184.38" dur="4.08">amount of species extinction or coral</text><text start="186.51" dur="4.56">bleaching or micro plastics in the ocean</text><text start="188.46" dur="6.6">or rampant addiction rates or etc so I</text><text start="191.07" dur="5.7">can take a true statistic out of context</text><text start="195.06" dur="4.32">of all the things to assess and say</text><text start="196.77" dur="3.9">quality of life is getting better I can</text><text start="199.38" dur="3.87">take another true statistic and say</text><text start="200.67" dur="4.26">quality of life is getting worse I can</text><text start="203.25" dur="3.45">group some group of those statistics</text><text start="204.93" dur="4.68">together to make a compelling argument</text><text start="206.7" dur="4.62">with a book on either side and neither</text><text start="209.61" dur="5.99">of them are representative of the whole</text><text start="211.32" dur="7.95">picture and so something can be true in</text><text start="215.6" dur="9.28">isolation but it is way too reductive</text><text start="219.27" dur="8.46">and as a result is if shared as</text><text start="224.88" dur="5.46">representative and isn&apos;t is actually a</text><text start="227.73" dur="7.25">weapon to convince a narrative that is</text><text start="230.34" dur="7.5">not actually a reasonable narrative and</text><text start="234.98" dur="4.9">so this is where I would say you know</text><text start="237.84" dur="4.77">like when we look at climate change we</text><text start="239.88" dur="4.8">have kind of like a Greta versus Trump</text><text start="242.61" dur="6.45">narrative warfare on climate change</text><text start="244.68" dur="5.85">right and we have people see letters</text><text start="249.06" dur="3.81">circulating on Facebook depending upon</text><text start="250.53" dur="5.22">which side they&apos;re on that say X number</text><text start="252.87" dur="4.53">of X percentage of scientists all agree</text><text start="255.75" dur="3.09">the climate change is real and both on</text><text start="257.4" dur="4.2">the only ones who think otherwise are</text><text start="258.84" dur="4.35">paid by oil companies and then also X</text><text start="261.6" dur="3.569">number of thousands of scientists say</text><text start="263.19" dur="3.69">the Clinton the IPCC climate change</text><text start="265.169" dur="6.021">thing is bunk and there&apos;s other</text><text start="266.88" dur="8.07">that we need to look at and who actually</text><text start="271.19" dur="5.41">looks at the science in detail</text><text start="274.95" dur="3.51">themselves looks at the methodology</text><text start="276.6" dur="3.42">looks at the models looks at where the</text><text start="278.46" dur="3.69">funding came from and the sources of</text><text start="280.02" dur="3.87">bias to actually be able to sense make</text><text start="282.15" dur="3.48">themselves they just defect the</text><text start="283.89" dur="4.02">authority that is most associated with</text><text start="285.63" dur="5.09">their in-group and the whole thing that</text><text start="287.91" dur="4.92">ends up being oriented around co2 and</text><text start="290.72" dur="4.69">either co2 is really a problem or co2</text><text start="292.83" dur="4.89">isn&apos;t a problem and that framing isn&apos;t</text><text start="295.41" dur="4.59">even the right conversation because we</text><text start="297.72" dur="4.53">look at okay what are the arguments for</text><text start="300.0" dur="3.87">co2 is a problem well there&apos;s arguments</text><text start="302.25" dur="2.94">about a lot of things but let&apos;s just</text><text start="303.87" dur="2.61">take for instance coral what&apos;s gonna</text><text start="305.19" dur="1.77">kill the coral that&apos;s gonna kill the</text><text start="306.48" dur="4.56">oceans</text><text start="306.96" dur="6.99">well carbonic acid can affect coral</text><text start="311.04" dur="6.12">that&apos;s true and increased temperature</text><text start="313.95" dur="5.55">can affect coral that&apos;s true but that</text><text start="317.16" dur="5.16">doesn&apos;t address nitrogen runoff from you</text><text start="319.5" dur="4.62">know radical amounts of NPK or other</text><text start="322.32" dur="3.42">nitrogen-based fertilizer creating</text><text start="324.12" dur="3.51">nitrogen flowing that causes both dead</text><text start="325.74" dur="4.08">zones and the oceans and messes up the</text><text start="327.63" dur="4.65">phosphorous cycle for the coral or</text><text start="329.82" dur="4.23">having over fished most of the large</text><text start="332.28" dur="5.52">fish species in the whale that create</text><text start="334.05" dur="5.82">the trophic cascades from the apex</text><text start="337.8" dur="4.08">predators that are actually necessary to</text><text start="339.87" dur="4.14">maintain the coral so again it&apos;s like</text><text start="341.88" dur="3.36">even if there are some stats about co2</text><text start="344.01" dur="3.12">that are true they might not be</text><text start="345.24" dur="3.21">representative of them of what we&apos;re</text><text start="347.13" dur="3.33">claiming they&apos;re representative of that</text><text start="348.45" dur="4.38">it&apos;s actually a multifactorial situation</text><text start="350.46" dur="4.71">and to try and get something through we</text><text start="352.83" dur="4.41">think we have to orient it in this</text><text start="355.17" dur="4.47">particular way and overhype that</text><text start="357.24" dur="5.67">particular thing now of course I can</text><text start="359.64" dur="5.85">actually use nitrogen fertilizer to grow</text><text start="362.91" dur="4.02">more plants that sequester co2 that will</text><text start="365.49" dur="3.36">actually increase the rate of nitrogen</text><text start="366.93" dur="4.97">runoff and even though I&apos;m sequestering</text><text start="368.85" dur="6.26">co2 I might be killing coral faster and</text><text start="371.9" dur="5.89">so this is an example where it&apos;s like no</text><text start="375.11" dur="7.3">better sense-making actually has to</text><text start="377.79" dur="5.85">happen and even facts lots of times the</text><text start="382.41" dur="2.43">facts are distorted like it&apos;s just</text><text start="383.64" dur="3.0"> science right</text><text start="384.84" dur="5.31">but sometimes the facts aren&apos;t distorted</text><text start="386.64" dur="5.51">the fact is true but is one out of lots</text><text start="390.15" dur="4.79">of metrics that matter</text><text start="392.15" dur="4.89">or taken out of appropriate context</text><text start="394.94" dur="3.93">where it is so not representative that</text><text start="397.04" dur="2.94">the solution that is recommended is</text><text start="398.87" dur="8.01">totally amazing</text><text start="399.98" dur="7.7">[Music]</text><text
