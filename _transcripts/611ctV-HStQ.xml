dur="5.92">meaning of life</text><text start="7.759" dur="7.441">daniel uh what is a meaningful life</text><text start="11.759" dur="6.241">i think um the semantics end up</text><text start="15.2" dur="5.12">mattering because a lot of people</text><text start="18.0" dur="3.119">will take the word meaning and the word</text><text start="20.32" dur="3.92">purpose</text><text start="21.119" dur="4.32">almost interchangeably and they&apos;ll talk</text><text start="24.24" dur="2.64">they&apos;ll think kind of what is the</text><text start="25.439" dur="2.641">meaning of my life what is the meaning</text><text start="26.88" dur="3.36">of human life what is the meaning of</text><text start="28.08" dur="4.639">life what&apos;s the meaning of the universe</text><text start="30.24" dur="4.319">and what what is the meaning of</text><text start="32.719" dur="3.121">existence rather non-existent so there&apos;s</text><text start="34.559" dur="3.84">a lot of kind of existential</text><text start="35.84" dur="4.399">considerations there and i think there&apos;s</text><text start="38.399" dur="3.281">some cognitive mistakes that are very</text><text start="40.239" dur="4.561">easy like</text><text start="41.68" dur="3.92">taking the idea of purpose which is like</text><text start="44.8" dur="2.72">a goal</text><text start="45.6" dur="3.68">which is a utilitarian concept the</text><text start="47.52" dur="3.28">purpose of one thing is defined in</text><text start="49.28" dur="3.36">relationship to other things that have</text><text start="50.8" dur="4.88">assumed value</text><text start="52.64" dur="3.919">um and to say what is the purpose of</text><text start="55.68" dur="2.719">everything well</text><text start="56.559" dur="3.441">it&apos;s a purpose is too small of a</text><text start="58.399" dur="3.121">question it&apos;s fundamentally a relative</text><text start="60.0" dur="3.039">question within everything what is the</text><text start="61.52" dur="2.8">purpose of one thing relative to another</text><text start="63.039" dur="2.721">what is the purpose of everything and</text><text start="64.32" dur="2.159">there&apos;s nothing outside of it with which</text><text start="65.76" dur="3.039">to say it</text><text start="66.479" dur="3.601">you actually just got to the limits of</text><text start="68.799" dur="3.36">the utility of the</text><text start="70.08" dur="3.6">concept of purpose it doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s</text><text start="72.159" dur="2.96">purposeless in the sense of something</text><text start="73.68" dur="3.04">inside of it being purposeless it means</text><text start="75.119" dur="4.721">the concept is too small</text><text start="76.72" dur="5.2">which is why you end up getting to you</text><text start="79.84" dur="4.56">know like in taoism talking about</text><text start="81.92" dur="4.4">the nature of it rather the there&apos;s a</text><text start="84.4" dur="3.84">fundamental what</text><text start="86.32" dur="4.24">where the why can&apos;t go deeper it is the</text><text start="88.24" dur="5.44">nature of it um</text><text start="90.56" dur="3.76">but uh i&apos;m gonna try to speak to a much</text><text start="93.68" dur="2.16">simpler</text><text start="94.32" dur="3.439">part which is when people think about</text><text start="95.84" dur="4.08">what is a meaningful human life</text><text start="97.759" dur="3.441">and kind of if we were to optimize for</text><text start="99.92" dur="2.08">something at the level of individual</text><text start="101.2" dur="3.599">life</text><text start="102.0" dur="4.079">but also how does optimizing for this at</text><text start="104.799" dur="4.481">the level of the individual life</text><text start="106.079" dur="5.68">lead to the best</text><text start="109.28" dur="3.6">society for insofar as people living</text><text start="111.759" dur="3.521">that way affects others</text><text start="112.88" dur="3.519">and long-term the world as a whole and</text><text start="115.28" dur="3.36">how would we then</text><text start="116.399" dur="5.121">make a civilization that was trying to</text><text start="118.64" dur="2.88">think about these things</text><text start="122.64" dur="3.2">because you can see that there are a lot</text><text start="123.84" dur="5.36">of dialectics where</text><text start="125.84" dur="6.399">there&apos;s value on two sides individualism</text><text start="129.2" dur="3.039">and collectivism or</text><text start="133.12" dur="4.24">the ability to accept things and the</text><text start="134.959" dur="6.081">ability to push harder and whatever</text><text start="137.36" dur="5.28">and there&apos;s failure modes on both sides</text><text start="141.04" dur="3.36">and so when you were starting to say</text><text start="142.64" dur="3.28">okay individual happiness you&apos;re like</text><text start="144.4" dur="2.64">wait sadists can be happy while</text><text start="145.92" dur="2.88">hurting people it&apos;s not individual</text><text start="147.04" dur="2.32">happiness it&apos;s love but wait some people</text><text start="148.8" dur="2.56">can</text><text start="149.36" dur="2.879">self-sacrifice out of love in a way that</text><text start="151.36" dur="2.64">actually ends up just creating</text><text start="152.239" dur="5.121">codependency for everybody</text><text start="154.0" dur="6.48">um or okay so so how do we think about</text><text start="157.36" dur="3.12">all those things together</text><text start="161.599" dur="6.241">one like this kind of came to me as a</text><text start="165.76" dur="3.44">a simple way that i kind of relate to it</text><text start="167.84" dur="3.679">is</text><text start="169.2" dur="3.6">that a meaningful life involves the mode</text><text start="171.519" dur="2.72">of being</text><text start="172.8" dur="4.4">the mode of doing and the mode of</text><text start="174.239" dur="7.521">becoming and it involves a virtuous</text><text start="177.2" dur="7.28">relationship between those three and</text><text start="181.76" dur="4.32">that any of those modes on their own</text><text start="184.48" dur="3.36">also have failure modes that are not a</text><text start="186.08" dur="3.6">meaningful life</text><text start="187.84" dur="4.319">the mode of being the way i would</text><text start="189.68" dur="6.0">describe it</text><text start="192.159" dur="4.401">if if we&apos;re talking about um the essence</text><text start="195.68" dur="3.68">of it</text><text start="196.56" dur="4.72">is about taking in and appreciating the</text><text start="199.36" dur="4.48">beauty of life that is now</text><text start="201.28" dur="3.28">it&apos;s a mode that is in the moment and</text><text start="203.84" dur="4.399">that is</text><text start="204.56" dur="5.12">largely about being with what is</text><text start="208.239" dur="2.56">it&apos;s fundamentally grounded in the</text><text start="209.68" dur="2.96">nature of experience and the</text><text start="210.799" dur="3.921">meaningfulness of experience</text><text start="212.64" dur="4.64">the prima facie meaningfulness of when</text><text start="214.72" dur="4.0">i&apos;m having this experience</text><text start="217.28" dur="3.679">i&apos;m not actually asking what the meaning</text><text start="218.72" dur="3.599">of life is i&apos;m actually full of it i&apos;m</text><text start="220.959" dur="5.2">full of experiencing it</text><text start="222.319" dur="7.2">the momentary experience yes</text><text start="226.159" dur="5.601">so taking in the beauty of life</text><text start="229.519" dur="3.521">doing is adding to the beauty of life</text><text start="231.76" dur="2.559">i&apos;m going to produce some art</text><text start="233.04" dur="2.479">i&apos;m going to produce some technology</text><text start="234.319" dur="2.321">that will make life easier more</text><text start="235.519" dur="5.28">beautiful for somebody else</text><text start="236.64" dur="5.679">i&apos;m going to uh do some science that</text><text start="240.799" dur="3.52">will end up leading to better</text><text start="242.319" dur="3.2">insights or others people&apos;s ability to</text><text start="244.319" dur="2.56">appreciate the beauty of life more</text><text start="245.519" dur="2.161">because they understand more about it or</text><text start="246.879" dur="2.401">whatever it is</text><text start="247.68" dur="4.4">or protect it right i&apos;m going to protect</text><text start="249.28" dur="4.159">it in some way but that&apos;s adding to</text><text start="252.08" dur="4.24">or being in service of the beauty of</text><text start="253.439" dur="5.04">life through our doing and becoming</text><text start="256.32" dur="3.599">is getting better at both of those being</text><text start="258.479" dur="2.88">able to deepen our being</text><text start="259.919" dur="3.361">which is to be able to take in the</text><text start="261.359" dur="5.041">beauty of life more profoundly</text><text start="263.28" dur="4.96">be more moved by it touched by it</text><text start="266.4" dur="3.12">and increasing our capacity with doing</text><text start="268.24" dur="4.8">to add to the beauty of life</text><text start="269.52" dur="6.64">more and</text><text start="273.04" dur="4.8">so i hold that a meaningful life has to</text><text start="276.16" dur="4.319">be all three of those</text><text start="277.84" dur="4.0">and where they&apos;re not in conflict with</text><text start="280.479" dur="3.601">each other</text><text start="281.84" dur="4.079">ultimately it grounds in being it</text><text start="284.08" dur="3.36">grounds in the intrinsic meaningfulness</text><text start="285.919" dur="3.521">of experience</text><text start="287.44" dur="3.199">and then my doing is ultimately</text><text start="289.44" dur="3.52">something that will</text><text start="290.639" dur="4.881">be able to increase the possibility of</text><text start="292.96" dur="5.519">the quality of experience for others</text><text start="295.52" dur="5.2">and my becoming is a deepening on those</text><text start="298.479" dur="5.761">so it grounds an experience and also the</text><text start="300.72" dur="4.8">evolutionary possibility of experience</text><text start="304.24" dur="3.12">and the point is to</text><text start="305.52" dur="5.04">[Music]</text><text start="307.36" dur="5.2">oscillate between these never getting</text><text start="310.56" dur="3.84">stuck on anyone</text><text start="312.56" dur="4.88">yeah or i suppose in parallel well you</text><text start="314.4" dur="6.56">can&apos;t really attention is a thing</text><text start="317.44" dur="3.52">you can only allocate attention</text><text start="322.24" dur="4.16">i want moments where i am absorbed in</text><text start="325.68" dur="3.6">the sunset and</text><text start="326.4" dur="4.4">i&apos;m not thinking about what to do next</text><text start="329.28" dur="3.52">and then</text><text start="330.8" dur="4.08">the fullness of that can make it to</text><text start="332.8" dur="3.36">where my doing doesn&apos;t come from what&apos;s</text><text start="334.88" dur="4.0">in it for me</text><text start="336.16" dur="4.479">because i actually feel overwhelmingly</text><text start="338.88" dur="4.879">full already</text><text start="340.639" dur="4.56">and then it&apos;s like how can i how can i</text><text start="343.759" dur="3.44">make life better for other people that</text><text start="345.199" dur="3.84">don&apos;t have as much opportunities i had</text><text start="347.199" dur="4.72">how can i add something wonderful how</text><text start="349.039" dur="4.561">can i just be in the creative process</text><text start="351.919" dur="3.521">and</text><text start="353.6" dur="3.439">so i think where the doing comes from</text><text start="355.44" dur="2.879">matters and if the doing comes from a</text><text start="357.039" dur="2.801">fullness of being</text><text start="358.319" dur="4.401">it&apos;s inherently going to be paying</text><text start="359.84" dur="4.72">attention to externalities</text><text start="362.72" dur="3.28">or it&apos;s more oriented to do that than if</text><text start="364.56" dur="3.12">it comes from some emptiness that</text><text start="366.0" dur="3.199">is trying to get full in some way that</text><text start="367.68" dur="2.799">is willing to cause sacrifices other</text><text start="369.199" dur="4.641">places and where a chunk of its</text><text start="370.479" dur="3.361">attention is internally focused</text><text start="373.919" dur="3.521">and so when buddha said desire is the</text><text start="375.919" dur="4.241">cause of all suffering then</text><text start="377.44" dur="4.56">later the vow of the bodhisattva which</text><text start="380.16" dur="3.36">was to show up for all sentient beings</text><text start="382.0" dur="5.759">in universe forever</text><text start="383.52" dur="4.239">is a pretty intense thing like desire</text><text start="388.319" dur="2.961">i would say there is a kind of desire if</text><text start="389.919" dur="3.041">we think of desire as a basis for</text><text start="391.28" dur="2.72">movement like a flow or a gradient</text><text start="392.96" dur="2.88">there&apos;s a kind of desire</text><text start="394.0" dur="3.6">that comes from something missing inside</text><text start="395.84" dur="3.359">seeking fulfillment of that</text><text start="397.6" dur="3.599">in the world that ends up being the</text><text start="399.199" dur="2.961">cause of actions that perpetuate</text><text start="401.199" dur="3.28">suffering</text><text start="402.16" dur="4.319">but there&apos;s also not just non-desire</text><text start="404.479" dur="4.321">there&apos;s a kind of desire that comes from</text><text start="406.479" dur="3.761">feeling full at the beauty of life and</text><text start="408.8" dur="4.64">wanting to add to it</text><text start="410.24" dur="4.64">that is a flow this direction and</text><text start="413.44" dur="3.199">i don&apos;t think that is the cause of</text><text start="414.88" dur="3.68">suffering i think that is</text><text start="416.639" dur="3.441">you know and the western traditions</text><text start="418.56" dur="2.079">right the eastern traditions focused on</text><text start="420.08" dur="2.32">that</text><text start="420.639" dur="3.601">and kind of unconditional happiness</text><text start="422.4" dur="3.76">outside of them in the moment outside of</text><text start="424.24" dur="3.679">time western tradition said no actually</text><text start="426.16" dur="2.96">desire is the source of creativity and</text><text start="427.919" dur="2.56">we&apos;re here to be</text><text start="429.12" dur="2.88">made in the image and likeness of the</text><text start="430.479" dur="2.56">creator we&apos;re here to be fundamentally</text><text start="432.0" dur="4.0">creative</text><text start="433.039" dur="3.521">but creating from where and in service</text><text start="436.0" dur="2.08">of what</text><text start="436.56" dur="3.12">creating from a sense of connection to</text><text start="438.08" dur="2.8">everything and wholeness in service of</text><text start="439.68" dur="3.84">the well-being of all of it</text><text start="440.88" dur="2.64">is very different</text><text start="444.16" dur="5.84">which is back to that compassion</text><text start="445.52" dur="7.2">conversion
