dur="2.79">having me Jim and looking forward to</text><text start="38.72" dur="3.45">this conversation yeah I followed your</text><text start="40.16" dur="4.11">work for some time and while I keep my</text><text start="42.17" dur="3.9">eye on several thinkers who are thinking</text><text start="44.27" dur="3.84">about the future of our society your</text><text start="46.07" dur="4.95">perspective is perhaps both the most</text><text start="48.11" dur="5.43">dire and the most hopeful interesting</text><text start="51.02" dur="5.37">that you can be both yeah I call that</text><text start="53.54" dur="4.2">kind of a hard fork hypothesis I like</text><text start="56.39" dur="2.88">that it&apos;s a good way to describe it you</text><text start="57.74" dur="3.72">know on the dire side you know you say</text><text start="59.27" dur="4.8">pretty explicitly you believe Humanity</text><text start="61.46" dur="4.71">is going to end relatively soon we don&apos;t</text><text start="64.07" dur="4.38">address some of our fundamental design</text><text start="66.17" dur="5.85">issues in our social operating system</text><text start="68.45" dur="5.07">yeah I basically say that when we look</text><text start="72.02" dur="3.54">at history we see that most of the</text><text start="73.52" dur="5.15">previous civilizations obviously they</text><text start="75.56" dur="6.33">don&apos;t still exist and they underwent</text><text start="78.67" dur="5.95">internal decay that led to how their</text><text start="81.89" dur="4.35">collapse occurred and we can look at the</text><text start="84.62" dur="3.57">way that Tainter studies this oh the way</text><text start="86.24" dur="3.69">Jared Diamond did or the way that kind</text><text start="88.19" dur="3.18">of Straus how or Baudrillard or</text><text start="89.93" dur="3.03">different models of civilization will</text><text start="91.37" dur="3.359">collapse describe it but they&apos;re just</text><text start="92.96" dur="3.78">like people have a life cycle there seem</text><text start="94.729" dur="3.781">to be these life cycles of civilization</text><text start="96.74" dur="3.84">and there are certain things in common</text><text start="98.51" dur="4.17">that lead to their breakdown the</text><text start="100.58" dur="4.68">difference now is that we have a fully</text><text start="102.68" dur="4.5">globalized civilization and rather than</text><text start="105.26" dur="3.149">just causing local environmental harm</text><text start="107.18" dur="3.36">that can lead to a limits of growth</text><text start="108.409" dur="3.121">issue we can affect the habitability the</text><text start="110.54" dur="3.21">biosphere at large</text><text start="111.53" dur="4.199">obviously we didn&apos;t use to have weapons</text><text start="113.75" dur="3.75">of mass destruction so there&apos;s a total</text><text start="115.729" dur="4.111">difference of the capacity for warfare</text><text start="117.5" dur="4.35">etc rates of Technology both the</text><text start="119.84" dur="4.77">globalization and technology have</text><text start="121.85" dur="4.26">changed the magnitude of the issues in a</text><text start="124.61" dur="3.509">way where the change of magnitude</text><text start="126.11" dur="4.2">actually becomes a change in kind and</text><text start="128.119" dur="3.84">yet we haven&apos;t figured out not</text><text start="130.31" dur="4.289">civilizational collapse so if we</text><text start="131.959" dur="4.86">forecast all of the different possible</text><text start="134.599" dur="4.14">catastrophic risks or existential risks</text><text start="136.819" dur="4.201">there&apos;s a lot of them and what I would</text><text start="138.739" dur="3.101">say is that they all are the result of</text><text start="141.02" dur="3.52">some under</text><text start="141.84" dur="4.56">common generator functions and so as a</text><text start="144.54" dur="4.29">result if we just tried to deal with a</text><text start="146.4" dur="3.87">particular AGI scenario or a particular</text><text start="148.83" dur="3.33">climate change or a particular</text><text start="150.27" dur="3.36">biodiversity loss or World War three</text><text start="152.16" dur="3.27">scenario we don&apos;t buy ourselves that</text><text start="153.63" dur="3.57">much time before another scenario</text><text start="155.43" dur="3.389">emerges because the situation is</text><text start="157.2" dur="3.78">basically over determined so we actually</text><text start="158.819" dur="3.361">have to address the generator functions</text><text start="160.98" dur="3.78">we have to address it categorically</text><text start="162.18" dur="4.38">rather than just instances and if we do</text><text start="164.76" dur="3.51">that that becomes the kernel of a new</text><text start="166.56" dur="3.03">civilizational model that is radically</text><text start="168.27" dur="4.049">different than any civilizations</text><text start="169.59" dur="5.46">heretofore which is the more optimistic</text><text start="172.319" dur="4.711">picture and this is kind of like a hard</text><text start="175.05" dur="3.78">fork between very different scenarios</text><text start="177.03" dur="4.47">yeah that was I was gonna say on the</text><text start="178.83" dur="4.71">hopeful side you&apos;re basically trying at</text><text start="181.5" dur="4.26">least to define a new social operating</text><text start="183.54" dur="3.81">system and at least for me and my kind</text><text start="185.76" dur="3.54">of naive way of looking at things it&apos;s</text><text start="187.35" dur="3.719">still a very rough sketch but I can see</text><text start="189.3" dur="4.05">that if you are able to fill this in it</text><text start="191.069" dur="3.571">may make human life vastly better and</text><text start="193.35" dur="3.6">more humane than it&apos;s ever been before</text><text start="194.64" dur="3.81">before we get to your specific so I</text><text start="196.95" dur="3.869">would like for our audience and keep in</text><text start="198.45" dur="4.16">mind that our audience are smart people</text><text start="200.819" dur="4.801">I hope but they&apos;re not necessarily</text><text start="202.61" dur="5.23">experts on the way you and I and Jordan</text><text start="205.62" dur="4.29">and some of our friends talk so I want</text><text start="207.84" dur="4.44">to make sure that neither of us get too</text><text start="209.91" dur="4.799">far afield in jargon and that we make</text><text start="212.28" dur="5.13">sure that we bring substrate issues up</text><text start="214.709" dur="4.321">before we dive in deeper specifically</text><text start="217.41" dur="4.049">I&apos;ve heard you talk in the past very</text><text start="219.03" dur="5.04">eloquently about how human created</text><text start="221.459" dur="4.291">technology is a fundamental change in</text><text start="224.07" dur="4.62">the dynamics of the world and that</text><text start="225.75" dur="5.459">technology I invented technology is</text><text start="228.69" dur="4.799">fundamentally different than evolution</text><text start="231.209" dur="4.201">and produces fundamentally different</text><text start="233.489" dur="3.601">dynamics we&apos;ll talk about that a little</text><text start="235.41" dur="3.87">bit before we jump into the more</text><text start="237.09" dur="4.95">specifics of where we&apos;re at yeah it&apos;s</text><text start="239.28" dur="5.22">definitely a kind of central thing for</text><text start="242.04" dur="3.77">us to figure out especially when if we</text><text start="244.5" dur="3.39">don&apos;t realize this we try and use</text><text start="245.81" dur="4.149">evolutionary biology and evolutionary</text><text start="247.89" dur="4.409">theory to model human systems like</text><text start="249.959" dur="4.411">reifying theory of markets based in</text><text start="252.299" dur="3.901">evolutionary theory and social Darwinism</text><text start="254.37" dur="3.839">writ large and that actually my</text><text start="256.2" dur="5.12">assessment doesn&apos;t work a lot of this</text><text start="258.209" dur="5.421">insight on the fundamental difference of</text><text start="261.32" dur="3.99">and evolution and highlighting it with</text><text start="263.63" dur="3.92">something Forrest Landry helped me</text><text start="265.31" dur="5.52">understand but model goes like this in</text><text start="267.55" dur="4.75">evolution in evolved systems we can kind</text><text start="270.83" dur="3.45">of think of evolution is defined by</text><text start="272.3" dur="4.29">three primary characteristics which is</text><text start="274.28" dur="4.2">mutation occurs and then selection</text><text start="276.59" dur="4.44">occurs but selection is two things does</text><text start="278.48" dur="4.86">the agent survive and does it reproduce</text><text start="281.03" dur="4.92">so survival selection mate selection and</text><text start="283.34" dur="5.31">then obviously that is survival and</text><text start="285.95" dur="4.59">mating with in evolutionary niches now</text><text start="288.65" dur="3.42">something to understand about that is</text><text start="290.54" dur="2.97">that the mutation pressures that are</text><text start="292.07" dur="3.6">affecting everything in an ecosystem</text><text start="293.51" dur="3.93">there&apos;s a kind of evenness of the</text><text start="295.67" dur="3.09">distribution of mutation pressures</text><text start="297.44" dur="3.6">whether we&apos;re talking about gamma rays</text><text start="298.76" dur="4.38">or oxidation or just copying errors or</text><text start="301.04" dur="4.65">viruses they&apos;re affecting all of the</text><text start="303.14" dur="4.62">Lions pretty similarly and the Lions and</text><text start="305.69" dur="4.2">the gazelles and the plants so we don&apos;t</text><text start="307.76" dur="3.39">have radical mutation occurring in one</text><text start="309.89" dur="2.91">place and no mutation occurring</text><text start="311.15" dur="3.69">somewhere else and so as you have a</text><text start="312.8" dur="3.87">mutation that would make a lion faster</text><text start="314.84" dur="3.75">or any predator faster you have similar</text><text start="316.67" dur="3.48">mutations that have a distribution and</text><text start="318.59" dur="3.06">the fastness and slowness of the prey</text><text start="320.15" dur="4.53">animals so then of course if you get a</text><text start="321.65" dur="4.98">little bit faster in one and they say</text><text start="324.68" dur="4.08">the lion eats the slower gazelles then</text><text start="326.63" dur="4.26">the fastest gazelles reproduce and that</text><text start="328.76" dur="3.54">leads to doubling down on those genes so</text><text start="330.89" dur="3.51">that&apos;s the next part is not just a</text><text start="332.3" dur="4.56">evenness in the distribution of mutation</text><text start="334.4" dur="4.41">but also Co selective pressures and so</text><text start="336.86" dur="4.23">the advance is anywhere lead to a pretty</text><text start="338.81" dur="4.92">strong symmetric coupling of power</text><text start="341.09" dur="4.68">across the whole system and so this</text><text start="343.73" dur="5.13">leads to a situation where you do have</text><text start="345.77" dur="5.31">rival risk dynamics in nature you do</text><text start="348.86" dur="4.41">have something like individual agents</text><text start="351.08" dur="3.3">doing self maximization of course it&apos;s</text><text start="353.27" dur="2.73">not purely that we have a lot of</text><text start="354.38" dur="2.73">symbiosis we have animals that are</text><text start="356.0" dur="2.64">paying attention to their yog and</text><text start="357.11" dur="3.06">animals that wouldn&apos;t survive it&apos;s not</text><text start="358.64" dur="3.92">for the whole group of animals that you</text><text start="360.17" dur="5.13">can model individual self optimizing</text><text start="362.56" dur="5.05">agents and get a certain successfulness</text><text start="365.3" dur="4.88">if you have the cemetry of power so you</text><text start="367.61" dur="5.52">have this line in this gazelle are in</text><text start="370.18" dur="4.48">rival risk dynamic but all lions and all</text><text start="373.13" dur="3.24">gazelles are symbiotic with each other</text><text start="374.66" dur="2.94">meaning the Lions would die without the</text><text start="376.37" dur="3.36">gazelles the gazelles would die without</text><text start="377.6" dur="4.14">the Lions and as either one makes an</text><text start="379.73" dur="3.54">advancement it drives the other one to</text><text start="381.74" dur="3.03">make an advancement so this is kind of</text><text start="383.27" dur="3.17">where when we think of social Darwinism</text><text start="384.77" dur="4.22">we think of the idea that</text><text start="386.44" dur="3.9">competition drives innovation and</text><text start="388.99" dur="3.81">advancement and those types of things</text><text start="390.34" dur="4.32">the difference when tech comes about is</text><text start="392.8" dur="3.57">so again these changes in the animals</text><text start="394.66" dur="3.63">are happening mediated through genetics</text><text start="396.37" dur="3.42">mutation of the genes and then survival</text><text start="398.29" dur="4.05">and then recombinant parts of the genes</text><text start="399.79" dur="5.16">so the genes are physically instantiated</text><text start="402.34" dur="5.25">pattern replicators when technology</text><text start="404.95" dur="4.65">technology I don&apos;t just mean physical</text><text start="407.59" dur="4.08">tech I also mean language I also mean</text><text start="409.6" dur="3.78">social tech coordination tech but so</text><text start="411.67" dur="3.66">techne and the Sanskrit sense of</text><text start="413.38" dur="3.69">consciously mediated methods of doing</text><text start="415.33" dur="3.72">things basically things that come from</text><text start="417.07" dur="3.81">the capacity for abstraction and</text><text start="419.05" dur="3.6">creating abstract pattern replicators</text><text start="420.88" dur="4.89">the abstract pattern replicators can</text><text start="422.65" dur="5.52">change much faster than the instantiated</text><text start="425.77" dur="4.5">ones can and they can change and with an</text><text start="428.17" dur="4.5">uneven distribution so when we think</text><text start="430.27" dur="4.53">about tool making starting with you know</text><text start="432.67" dur="4.68">Homo habilis and stone tools right which</text><text start="434.8" dur="4.83">is very different than a chimp using a</text><text start="437.35" dur="3.93">rock that it finds but not whittling</text><text start="439.63" dur="4.14">sharper you know we&apos;re chipping a</text><text start="441.28" dur="4.23">sharper rock which is the chimp or the</text><text start="443.77" dur="4.26">bird or whatever it is that&apos;s using</text><text start="445.51" dur="4.32">something can experientially notice that</text><text start="448.03" dur="3.3">this thing is better at doing what it</text><text start="449.83" dur="3.51">wants than this thing is in the moment</text><text start="451.33" dur="4.41">but it can&apos;t understand that between all</text><text start="453.34" dur="3.78">three rocks why this one is better at</text><text start="455.74" dur="3.36">cutting the thing is because of the</text><text start="457.12" dur="3.81">abstract principle of sharpness and then</text><text start="459.1" dur="3.36">say oh I understand what mediates</text><text start="460.93" dur="3.39">sharpness and I can design something</text><text start="462.46" dur="3.9">with more sharpness that abstraction</text><text start="464.32" dur="4.05">capacity seems to be part of how we</text><text start="466.36" dur="4.11">define early humans and then got double</text><text start="468.37" dur="4.11">down in Homo sapiens and it&apos;s a</text><text start="470.47" dur="4.17">different process than evolution of</text><text start="472.48" dur="3.93">bringing new stuff into existence it&apos;s</text><text start="474.64" dur="4.23">not occurring through kind of random</text><text start="476.41" dur="4.35">mutation and just selective dynamics</text><text start="478.87" dur="3.24">it&apos;s occurring through an agent that&apos;s</text><text start="480.76" dur="3.659">actually understanding something</text><text start="482.11" dur="4.26">abstractly and intentionally creating it</text><text start="484.419" dur="4.051">and so if you think about evolution as</text><text start="486.37" dur="3.78">the stuff that emerges there wasn&apos;t a</text><text start="488.47" dur="3.449">conscious choice to have something</text><text start="490.15" dur="3.72">emerge it emerged as the result of</text><text start="491.919" dur="4.141">complexity dynamics so it&apos;s unconscious</text><text start="493.87" dur="4.32">it&apos;s radically parallel it&apos;s radically</text><text start="496.06" dur="4.83">distributed it&apos;s radically combinatoric</text><text start="498.19" dur="4.86">it&apos;s slow almost everything fails but</text><text start="500.89" dur="4.05">you get a interoperability of everything</text><text start="503.05" dur="4.2">so what makes it through or very</text><text start="504.94" dur="4.68">self-stabilizing complex systems with</text><text start="507.25" dur="3.31">technology it&apos;s actually consciously</text><text start="509.62" dur="2.89">created</text><text start="510.56" dur="3.39">it can happen in a local way not</text><text start="512.51" dur="3.12">everywhere so it&apos;s not radically</text><text start="513.95" dur="4.44">parallel and decentralized it happens</text><text start="515.63" dur="5.339">more in a serial fashion and it creates</text><text start="518.39" dur="5.31">parts that are not necessarily in</text><text start="520.969" dur="4.471">equilibrium with whole systems and so it</text><text start="523.7" dur="4.079">really is mathematically almost an</text><text start="525.44" dur="4.26">opposite kind of creative process and</text><text start="527.779" dur="4.321">the thing is if you have an evolutionary</text><text start="529.7" dur="5.85">agent like a human that has evolutionary</text><text start="532.1" dur="6.36">motives but is now able to say human</text><text start="535.55" dur="5.31">operating as apex predator can increase</text><text start="538.46" dur="4.53">its predatory capacity orders of</text><text start="540.86" dur="4.77">magnitude rapidly faster than the</text><text start="542.99" dur="5.07">environment can increase its resilience</text><text start="545.63" dur="4.29">to that predatory capacity now we have a</text><text start="548.06" dur="4.05">fundamental problem this is a lion</text><text start="549.92" dur="4.02">getting a thousand times faster in a</text><text start="552.11" dur="4.65">hurry without gazelles being able to</text><text start="553.94" dur="4.83">make a mutation in adequate time and</text><text start="556.76" dur="4.68">lions eat all the gazelles and then go</text><text start="558.77" dur="5.04">extinct and so we have a situation where</text><text start="561.44" dur="5.04">technology has broken the power cemetry</text><text start="563.81" dur="4.95">that is what is necessary for the meta</text><text start="566.48" dur="4.32">stability of evolved systems and so you</text><text start="568.76" dur="3.72">see that not only is there cemetry of</text><text start="570.8" dur="3.42">power between the line and the gazelle</text><text start="572.48" dur="3.6">there&apos;s also a symmetry of power between</text><text start="574.22" dur="2.369">lions and lions and gazelles and</text><text start="576.08" dur="4.23">gazelles</text><text start="576.589" dur="5.971">the most badass lion is only you know 2x</text><text start="580.31" dur="4.59">or one and a half X more than the median</text><text start="582.56" dur="4.23">lion but if we look at putin&apos;s killing</text><text start="584.9" dur="3.84">ability or Trump&apos;s compared to yours or</text><text start="586.79" dur="4.83">mine it might be billions or trillions</text><text start="588.74" dur="5.07">of times more and the same we could say</text><text start="591.62" dur="4.17">for economic capacity and if you look at</text><text start="593.81" dur="3.63">sapiens writ

that is really different than</text><text start="734.689" dur="4.32">every other animal and like again if we</text><text start="737.72" dur="3.209">think of the examples you were just</text><text

whole</text><text start="762.379" dur="4.171">ecosystems they also can genetically</text><text start="764.089" dur="4.261">engineer new creatures so we have to</text><text start="766.55"

dur="4.8">that and on our first episode with Simon</text><text start="784.339" dur="4.981">today oh we talked fair amount about the</text><text start="786.62" dur="4.29">rate of social evolution is

now than it was just 30 years ago</text><text start="796.22" dur="4.41">and if we&apos;re already approaching the</text><text start="797.899" dur="5.31">limits probably exceeded the sustainable</text><text start="800.63" dur="4.769">limits of our society and we have social</text><text start="803.209" dur="4.531">evolution that&apos;s going exponential and</text><text start="805.399" dur="4.591">we still have a rising world population</text><text start="807.74" dur="3.98">last I saw projected to top out 11</text><text start="809.99" dur="5.58">billion with many of those people</text><text start="811.72" dur="5.65">expecting a increase in their lifestyle</text><text start="815.57" dur="3.569">quote unquote towards the American and</text><text start="817.37" dur="4.14">European one looks like to me a</text><text start="819.139" dur="5.611">trainwreck coming at very high speed</text><text start="821.51" dur="6.66">right and so again this idea that we</text><text start="824.75" dur="5.639">didn&apos;t start over hunting an environment</text><text start="828.17" dur="3.81">and then it became harder to eat and</text><text start="830.389" dur="3.331">breed so then we came in to sustainable</text><text start="831.98" dur="3.299">population with the environment we just</text><text start="833.72" dur="4.14">moved to another environment there is</text><text start="835.279" dur="4.231">this kind of rebound effect that we see</text><text start="837.86" dur="3.57">with humans and we see it in all of</text><text start="839.51" dur="3.03">evolution right like our friend bred why</text><text start="841.43" dur="2.82">interesting we&apos;ll say if there&apos;s an</text><text start="842.54" dur="3.75">evolutionary niche it will get filled</text><text start="844.25" dur="4.35">with something right so in the similar</text><text start="846.29" dur="4.2">sense though with humans we don&apos;t have</text><text start="848.6" dur="3.45">to wait for a genetic mutation we can</text><text start="850.49" dur="4.5">have a memetic mutation to figure out</text><text start="852.05" dur="4.86">how to exploit some new niche and so</text><text start="854.99" dur="3.539">this is where we get rebound effects</text><text start="856.91" dur="3.179">where it increases in efficiency don&apos;t</text><text start="858.529" dur="3.06">lead to us being more sustainable the</text><text start="860.089" dur="3.961">environment they lead to us figuring out</text><text start="861.589" dur="4.261">how to have profitable exploits on more</text><text start="864.05" dur="3.57">area and so you know when you look at</text><text start="865.85" dur="4.14">something like the jebin&apos;s paradox or</text><text start="867.62" dur="4.89">other abstractions of it if I give a 20%</text><text start="869.99" dur="4.98">increase in energy efficiency we don&apos;t</text><text start="872.51" dur="4.439">just use 20% less energy we find whole</text><text start="874.97" dur="4.619">new markets that weren&apos;t open based on</text><text start="876.949" dur="4.681">now the what&apos;s gonna be profitable we go</text><text start="879.589" dur="4.471">exploit those and in the abusing more</text><text start="881.63" dur="3.93">net energy as a result and so when you</text><text start="884.06" dur="3.3">look at like trying to figure out a</text><text start="885.56" dur="4.02">steady-state population steady-state</text><text start="887.36" dur="3.6">population doesn&apos;t actually work</text><text start="889.58" dur="3.63">it doesn&apos;t work the way that we like to</text><text start="890.96" dur="4.38">model in evolutionary biology with the</text><text start="893.21" dur="4.32">way that humans continue to advance</text><text start="895.34" dur="4.23">increases in capacity and efficiency and</text><text start="897.53" dur="3.68">then exploit all yeah and you&apos;ve spoken</text><text start="899.57" dur="4.2">quite a bit about you combine</text><text start="901.21" dur="6.76">exponentially increasing technology with</text><text start="903.77" dur="6.24">the core rival risks win-loss dynamics</text><text start="907.97" dur="3.84">of at least our economic system and a</text><text start="910.01" dur="3.48">goodly part of our social system you</text><text start="911.81" dur="4.77">talk a little bit about how the coupling</text><text start="913.49" dur="5.79">of those two together are spectacularly</text><text start="916.58" dur="5.46">different than either by itself yeah so</text><text start="919.28" dur="4.65">this is I mentioned earlier that all the</text><text start="922.04" dur="3.75">catastrophic and existential risks have</text><text start="923.93" dur="4.86">underlying generator functions what I</text><text start="925.79" dur="7.29">mean by that is that so like let&apos;s say</text><text start="928.79" dur="5.37">we&apos;re looking at wanting to stop or take</text><text start="933.08" dur="4.17">your kind of environmental destruction</text><text start="934.16" dur="5.28">or war or whatever it is well we can</text><text start="937.25" dur="3.6">look at why are those things caused and</text><text start="939.44" dur="3.39">we can find some things that seems</text><text start="940.85" dur="3.78">special to specific instances but some</text><text start="942.83" dur="3.48">things that are part of a causal set</text><text start="944.63" dur="3.3">that are true across all of them so</text><text start="946.31" dur="4.29">obviously we can look at something like</text><text start="947.93" dur="4.71">perverse incentive and so with the</text><text start="950.6" dur="4.5">environmental destruction if the wild</text><text start="952.64" dur="5.28">birds aren&apos;t worth very much to us in</text><text start="955.1" dur="4.47">the wild but domesticated ones and farms</text><text start="957.92" dur="4.17">where the farms take over the wild areas</text><text start="959.57" dur="4.62">are if cattle are worth something to us</text><text start="962.09" dur="4.17">when domesticated and then killed and</text><text start="964.19" dur="3.87">not when they&apos;re free and of course we</text><text start="966.26" dur="3.84">have an economic incentive to exploit</text><text start="968.06" dur="3.48">everything and the same would be true if</text><text start="970.1" dur="3.18">we have a for-profit military industrial</text><text start="971.54" dur="3.93">complex where war is more profitable</text><text start="973.28" dur="4.62">than pieces and so the underlying idea</text><text start="975.47" dur="5.31">here is that you can&apos;t prevent a harm</text><text start="977.9" dur="4.68">well there is a very strong incentive to</text><text start="980.78" dur="3.27">cause it because that incentive is kind</text><text start="982.58" dur="3.57">of an evolutionary niche for a</text><text start="984.05" dur="3.72">particular and way of getting ahead and</text><text start="986.15" dur="3.75">it will end up getting filled so we try</text><text start="987.77" dur="4.23">to make law to bind that but as we know</text><text start="989.9" dur="4.11">strong economic power ends up being able</text><text start="992.0" dur="4.32">to influence law pretty heavily so the</text><text start="994.01" dur="4.53">thing that is designed to bind the</text><text start="996.32" dur="3.45">problems of the incentive system ends up</text><text start="998.54" dur="2.46">getting corrupted by the incentive</text><text start="999.77" dur="3.21">system so we can get into that more</text><text start="1001.0" dur="3.9">later but this is an idea of something</text><text start="1002.98" dur="4.23">like perverse incentive that isn&apos;t</text><text start="1004.9" dur="4.17">unique to one issue it&apos;s underneath lots</text><text start="1007.21" dur="3.63">of issues so if we want to abstract and</text><text start="1009.07" dur="4.17">say what are the generators that give</text><text start="1010.84" dur="4.62">rise to all of the possible existential</text><text start="1013.24" dur="3.54">risks in the future the first one is the</text><text start="1015.46" dur="3.09">one that you just mentioned first one I</text><text start="1016.78" dur="3.86">would identify is that if humans are</text><text start="1018.55" dur="4.22">running rival risk games and by right</text><text start="1020.64" dur="4.5">wrist games I mean some in group that is</text><text start="1022.77" dur="4.68">seeking to get ahead in a way that can</text><text start="1025.14" dur="4.319">occur at the expense of an out group</text><text start="1027.45" dur="5.43">and/or the comments so whether that&apos;s a</text><text start="1029.459" dur="5.851">person or a company or a country if it</text><text start="1032.88" dur="4.26">can beat someone else via a war or it</text><text start="1035.31" dur="3.84">can exploit an environment and get ahead</text><text start="1037.14" dur="3.96">or it can corner the market or whatever</text><text start="1039.15" dur="5.49">it is it&apos;s playing a game where it&apos;s win</text><text start="1041.1" dur="5.34">is going to require or at least reserves</text><text start="1044.64" dur="2.22">the right to be at the cost of something</text><text start="1046.44" dur="3.87">else</text><text start="1046.86" dur="6.18">if we run rival risk games but we&apos;re not</text><text start="1050.31" dur="4.83">limited in our rival risk capacity the</text><text start="1053.04" dur="4.32">way animals are because we can innovate</text><text start="1055.14" dur="5.04">new ways of winning and rivalry via</text><text start="1057.36" dur="4.92">abstraction ie tech but then the moment</text><text start="1060.18" dur="4.11">we deploy some new asymmetric tech</text><text start="1062.28" dur="3.99">everybody sees it reverse engineers it</text><text start="1064.29" dur="3.75">makes mutations on it and so we keep</text><text start="1066.27" dur="3.6">ratcheting up power then we get an</text><text start="1068.04" dur="3.27">exponential power equation but we&apos;re</text><text start="1069.87" dur="3.45">we&apos;re using power in ways that</text><text start="1071.31" dur="4.61">inexorably cause some harm to the

dur="3.96">field and not have more entropy than the</text><text start="1080.01" dur="3.63">system can handle so rivalries games</text><text start="1082.08" dur="4.53">multiplied by exponential tech</text><text start="1083.64" dur="5.19">self-terminate and right now exponential</text><text start="1086.61" dur="4.02">tech is inexorable we cannot put the cat</text><text start="1088.83" dur="4.11">back in the bag we can&apos;t stop it so</text><text start="1090.63" dur="4.95">either we figure out rigorously anti</text><text start="1092.94" dur="5.85">rivalry systems or the human experiment</text><text start="1095.58" dur="5.31">as we know it is finite in duration but</text><text start="1098.79" dur="4.38">the thing is to say rivalry systems</text><text start="1100.89" dur="4.02">that&apos;s a big deal because separate</text><text start="1103.17" dur="3.27">nation states are the basis of rivalry</text><text start="1104.91" dur="3.42">systems and so our private balance</text><text start="1106.44" dur="4.05">sheets and so the changes that we&apos;re</text><text start="1108.33" dur="3.81">proposing are very very fundamental ones</text><text start="1110.49" dur="3.48">they&apos;re ones at the level of the axioms</text><text start="1112.14" dur="3.09">of what we think of as civilization but</text><text start="1113.97" dur="3.63">that&apos;s why we have to

dur="5.01">important I would start by wanting to</text><text start="1244.7" dur="4.89">just be clear on the fundamental</text><text start="1247.13" dur="4.02">difference between a market and a</text><text start="1249.59" dur="2.82">government and the relationship between</text><text start="1251.15" dur="4.14">those because what you&apos;re talking about</text><text start="1252.41" dur="4.49">is a government regulating a market yes</text><text start="1255.29" dur="4.32">in fact that would call that the modern</text><text start="1256.9" dur="4.84">Democratic liberal synthesis that</text><text start="1259.61" dur="4.5">started in the 1920s was fully in</text><text start="1261.74" dur="5.61">existence by the 1930s and was locked in</text><text start="1264.11" dur="5.49">in its modern form in 1948 great so what</text><text start="1267.35" dur="4.92">I would say is that there are certain</text><text start="1269.6" dur="4.64">architectures within markets that lead</text><text start="1272.27" dur="3.98">inexorably to certain issues other</text><text start="1274.24" dur="4.17">within governments and I&apos;m gonna try and</text><text start="1276.25" dur="4.32">abstract us at the most abstract level</text><text start="1278.41" dur="3.93">that works which is this will be true</text><text start="1280.57" dur="3.239">for any form of government whether it&apos;s</text><text start="1282.34" dur="3.51">a two-party system or a three-party</text><text start="1283.809" dur="4.231">system or has a parliament or doesn&apos;t do</text><text

same is true for</text><text start="1293.35" dur="3.959">whether we&apos;re talking about any</text><text start="1295.03" dur="3.99">different version of how one might think</text><text start="1297.309" dur="3.511">of a market so if we think of a market</text><text start="1299.02" dur="3.93">you can actually think about theory of</text><text start="1300.82" dur="4.8">markets like pure lays a fair theory and</text><text start="1302.95" dur="4.08">try and model it via evolutionary theory</text><text start="1305.62" dur="3.3">and people do and this is where social</text><text start="1307.03" dur="4.14">Darwinism kind of comes right which is</text><text start="1308.92" dur="4.35">these three things mutation survival</text><text start="1311.17" dur="4.68">selection and then mating mating</text><text start="1313.27" dur="4.05">selection are what define the success of</text><text start="1315.85" dur="3.45">markets so you have an environmental</text><text start="1317.32" dur="4.98">niche which here would be called demand</text><text start="1319.3" dur="5.19">people need real stuff and so then that</text><text start="1322.3" dur="4.259">creates a impetus to try and figure out</text><text start="1324.49" dur="3.6">how to fit that niche which is supply it</text><text start="1326.559" dur="3.031">will make some product or service to try</text><text start="1328.09" dur="3.36">and do it but they&apos;ll make slightly</text><text start="1329.59" dur="3.69">different versions that equals mutation</text><text start="1331.45" dur="3.66">the one that actually meets people&apos;s</text><text start="1333.28" dur="3.27">needs best of the best value is the one</text><text start="1335.11" dur="3.21">that will make it through survival</text><text start="1336.55" dur="3.57">selection and then if a few of them have</text><text start="1338.32" dur="3.96">different properties that are all really</text><text start="1340.12" dur="4.23">desirable they might mate and meaning</text><text start="1342.28" dur="3.42">you know merger and acquisition or IP</text><text start="1344.35" dur="3.12">trade or whatever and you get a</text><text start="1345.7" dur="3.24">recombinant oriole dynamic and that&apos;s</text><text start="1347.47" dur="4.5">main selection and that&apos;s the idea right</text><text start="1348.94" dur="5.13">except as we mentioned that&apos;s true but</text><text start="1351.97" dur="4.65">you don&apos;t get the meta stability of an</text><text start="1354.07" dur="4.8">evolved system because of the a</text><text

instantiated replicators so if</text><text start="1362.59" dur="5.339">we think about a market as a bottom-up</text><text start="1365.32" dur="4.35">coordination system and bottom-up</text><text start="1367.929" dur="3.511">meaning that we aren&apos;t we don&apos;t have</text><text start="1369.67" dur="3.3">long term central planning of what we&apos;re</text><text start="1371.44" dur="2.869">trying to do everybody&apos;s not trying to</text><text start="1372.97" dur="3.63">agree on something we&apos;re just</text><text start="1374.309" dur="4.241">interacting with each other via supply</text><text start="1376.6" dur="4.44">and demand dynamics and stuff gets up</text><text start="1378.55" dur="4.71">regulated so that basically the society</text><text start="1381.04" dur="4.74">is all emergent properties of the</text><text start="1383.26" dur="4.29">bottom-up interactions so that&apos;s one</text><text start="1385.78" dur="3.81">kind of thing and we can really think of</text><text start="1387.55" dur="4.259">as having certain characteristics of</text><text start="1389.59" dur="3.81">just the bottom-up math of it one thing</text><text start="1391.809" dur="4.831">I would say then and this is a critique</text><text start="1393.4" dur="4.68">of libertarian ideology free-market kind</text><text start="1396.64" dur="4.289">of ideology writ large</text><text start="1398.08" dur="4.979">is that without regulation markets are</text><text start="1400.929" dur="5.161">going to have multipolar traps that they</text><text start="1403.059" dur="5.881">cannot resolve and by a multipolar trap</text><text start="1406.09" dur="4.949">it&apos;s a generalization of weather it&apos;s a</text><text start="1408.94" dur="4.32">tragedy of the Commons or an arms race</text><text start="1411.039" dur="4.13">or any kind of race to the cliff a race</text><text start="1413.26" dur="4.83">to the bottom these are scenarios where</text><text start="1415.169" dur="4.75">somebody can do something that is bad</text><text start="1418.09" dur="3.51">for the whole over the long term but</text><text start="1419.919" dur="3.271">very good for them over the near term</text><text start="1421.6" dur="4.23">and provides so much competitive</text><text start="1423.19" dur="4.709">advantage that without law to bind it</text><text start="1425.83" dur="3.39">people will still buy the thing they</text><text start="1427.899" dur="3.03">will still be able to get employees</text><text start="1429.22" dur="4.41">right like the market forces won&apos;t stop</text><text start="1430.929" dur="5.88">it and so then everyone else has to</text><text start="1433.63" dur="5.1">compete to do the same thing or they</text><text start="1436.809" dur="3.87">will just lose by default in the short</text><text start="1438.73" dur="3.929">term so now you have everybody competing</text><text start="1440.679" dur="3.6">to get the cheaper material that is</text><text start="1442.659" dur="4.321">comprehensively damaging the environment</text><text start="1444.279" dur="4.26">or racing to cut down the trees faster</text><text start="1446.98" dur="2.909">than they actually need them because if</text><text start="1448.539" dur="3.571">they don&apos;t the other guy will cut down</text><text start="1449.889" dur="3.9">the trees anyways or one guy makes a I</text><text start="1452.11" dur="3.48">weapon so everybody has to make the AI</text><text start="1453.789" dur="2.281">weapons where they&apos;re going to lose by</text><text start="1455.59" dur="4.319">default</text><text start="1456.07" dur="6.78">and so multipolar traps in the past when</text><text start="1459.909" dur="6.211">we had limited power could lead to boom</text><text start="1462.85" dur="5.459">and bust cycles where we start polluting</text><text start="1466.12" dur="4.14">the water because say everybody else</text><text start="1468.309" dur="3.12">isn&apos;t polluting the water my pollution</text><text start="1470.26" dur="3.45">of the water doesn&apos;t make it that much</text><text start="1471.429" dur="4.38">worse but not having to deal with my</text><text start="1473.71" dur="3.929">pollution properly increases my margins</text><text start="1475.809" dur="3.181">because I externalize some of the cost</text><text start="1477.639" dur="2.731">so I&apos;m getting ahead then other people</text><text start="1478.99" dur="3.149">say it that guy&apos;s getting so much</text><text start="1480.37" dur="3.059">more ahead everybody starts doing it</text><text start="1482.139" dur="2.701">eventually the water is so polluted that</text><text start="1483.429" dur="3.541">everybody is doing worse because the</text><text start="1484.84" dur="4.26">fish are all dead so then there&apos;s now a</text><text start="1486.97" dur="4.41">new market for selling water purifiers</text><text start="1489.1" dur="4.47">and so we start doing that thing until</text><text start="1491.38" dur="3.87">you know then there is a new scenario</text><text start="1493.57" dur="3.989">for the pollution to occur so you get</text><text start="1495.25" dur="4.169">these kind of best you get a race to the</text><text start="1497.559" dur="3.181">bottom and then some new market</text><text start="1499.419" dur="3.36">opportunity race to the top with</text><text start="1500.74" dur="3.87">exponentially more people and</text><text start="1502.779" dur="4.441">exponentially more power per person more</text><text start="1504.61" dur="4.08">moreover you have situations where the</text><text start="1507.22" dur="3.04">bottom can be so bad that it&apos;s</text><text start="1508.69" dur="3.73">unrecoverable let me jump</text><text start="1510.26" dur="4.35">but here you&apos;re drawing the classic 19th</text><text start="1512.42" dur="4.47">century Adam Smith

dur="5.88">where we assume it is the job of the</text><text start="1522.11" dur="4.53">legal political government side as</text><text start="1524.63" dur="4.56">instantiated through democracy to

start="1557.63" dur="5.91">a magnificently powerful signal to stop</text><text start="1560.66" dur="5.01">using carbon would empower alternative</text><text start="1563.54" dur="4.17">energy production in a very major way a</text><text start="1565.67" dur="4.17">second one much simpler one of the hacks</text><text start="1567.71" dur="4.59">we know that our current system does is</text><text start="1569.84" dur="4.32">you psychologically informed advertising</text><text start="1572.3" dur="4.35">to invent demand suppose we put a two</text><text start="1574.16" dur="4.44">hundred percent tax on all advertising I</text><text start="1576.65" dur="5.22">have ten more I could throw out there so</text><text start="1578.6" dur="5.49">why can&apos;t a list of powerful parameters</text><text start="1581.87" dur="4.26">tame the market without having to</text><text start="1584.09" dur="4.53">undergo the radical shift that you&apos;re</text><text start="1586.13" dur="4.29">talking about forgive me I was starting</text><text start="1588.62" dur="3.15">with an unregulated market because I</text><text start="1590.42" dur="3.48">wanted to establish something about</text><text start="1591.77" dur="4.29">theory of the markets which is why we</text><text start="1593.9" dur="4.98">can do just a libertarian thing and why</text><text start="1596.06" dur="4.8">there is a good case for a regulated</text><text start="1598.88" dur="3.98">market now once you then do a</text><text start="1600.86" dur="4.17">construction on what&apos;s

dur="2.34">together because I have to refer to</text><text start="1607.4" dur="3.09">what&apos;s wrong with each one individually</text><text start="1608.57" dur="4.26">before I can do the combined test all</text><text start="1610.49" dur="4.47">right you go right ahead okay so</text><text start="1612.83" dur="4.2">basically anything that has bottom-up</text><text start="1614.96" dur="4.2">coordination only but abstraction</text><text start="1617.03" dur="3.66">mediated capacities like markets is</text><text start="1619.16" dur="3.72">going to fall to multipolar

dur="5.85">then this is at least of the story of a</text><text start="1628.55" dur="5.31">major reason why we justify creating</text><text start="1630.71" dur="5.13">states which is okay we don&apos;t want</text><text start="1633.86" dur="4.2">everybody to cut down all of the trees</text><text start="1635.84" dur="2.99">just to store them as lumber because if</text><text start="1638.06" dur="2.839">they don&apos;t do</text><text start="1638.83" dur="3.54">I will and were left with no trees and</text><text start="1640.899" dur="3.451">yet how do we deal with this we have a</text><text start="1642.37" dur="5.49">real coordination problem well we need</text><text start="1644.35" dur="5.819">to create some entity that has the</text><text start="1647.86" dur="4.289">ability to stop

good laws and we want the</text><text start="1659.799" dur="5.341">ability to enforce those laws so we</text><text start="1661.96" dur="5.43">agree to bequeath to a government a</text><text

dur="5.311">groups now we can say why do we create</text><text start="1685.179" dur="4.651">States well one reason is to unify</text><text start="1687.1" dur="5.01">groups to be able to win Wars and

dur="3.33">so that we can coordinate better and</text><text start="1695.47" dur="4.559">arguably the actual reason is to</text><text start="1697.45" dur="4.319">consolidate power even more but that is</text><text start="1700.029" dur="3.451">not the answer that is given it when</text><text start="1701.769" dur="3.241">justifying it so if we think about a</text><text start="1703.48" dur="3.299">government the government is now not a</text><text start="1705.01" dur="4.259">bottom-up system it&apos;s a top-down system</text><text start="1706.779" dur="4.831">meaning that there is

an</text><text start="1951.119" dur="5.25">implicit carbon tariff on imports so</text><text start="1954.179" dur="4.171">let&apos;s say the Chinese want to defect and</text><text start="1956.369"

that we do care</text><text start="1961.559" dur="5.55">but at least partially we can penalize</text><text start="1963.6" dur="5.939">them by putting a tariff equal to the</text><text start="1967.109" dur="3.93">implicit carbon tax that we would have</text><text start="1969.539" dur="3.51">charged for the equivalent amount of</text><text start="1971.039" dur="3.87">carbon in a product and in a

dur="5.61">dependent on trade this is at least a</text><text start="1979.649" dur="5.1">partial way of raising the cost quite</text><text start="1982.619" dur="4.02">significantly for those who defect

dur="4.5">u.s. agreed to do that but then let&apos;s</text><text start="1990.989" dur="3.961">say Brazil under its new presidency says</text><text start="1993.72" dur="3.929"> that all buy the stuff from China</text><text start="1994.95" dur="4.289">and they have some capacity to and say</text><text start="1997.649" dur="3.931">Russia does say some other places do</text><text start="1999.239"

dur="4.229">again the essence of a coordination</text><text start="2011.869" dur="4.951">problem from the view of it</text><text start="2014.809" dur="3.541">make sense if we all did the good

strange</text><text start="2025.429" dur="3.21">attractor be everybody default to</text><text start="2027.2" dur="3.03">defection yeah the answer the prisoner&apos;s</text><text start="2028.639" dur="3.75">dilemma as we all know is you have Tony</text><text start="2030.23" dur="5.399">Soprano right that if you defect I&apos;ll</text><text start="2032.389" dur="5.941">kill ya yeah which is basically you know</text><text start="2035.629" dur="4.441">some kind of even worse punishment than</text><text start="2038.33" dur="3.87">the original thing was its outside of</text><text start="2040.07" dur="4.319">the scenario and that ends up being how</text><text start="2042.2" dur="3.959">we do it right which is underneath our</text><text start="2044.389" dur="4.2">tariff situation we&apos;re willing to go to</text><text start="2046.159" dur="4.351">war to uphold a lot of these things but</text><text start="2048.589" dur="5.0">now let&apos;s come back to even within a</text><text start="2050.51" dur="5.879">country so we know that right now</text><text start="2053.589" dur="7.75">someone&apos;s ability to get elected has to</text><text start="2056.389" dur="8.22">do with largely their access to not just</text><text start="2061.339" dur="5.371">capital but also a lie ship so that&apos;s</text><text start="2064.609" dur="3.901">going to affect how other</text><text start="2066.71" dur="3.81">representatives support them and how</text><text start="2068.51" dur="3.96">much they can do campaigning and media</text><text start="2070.52" dur="3.869">they can get and all those kinds of</text><text start="2072.47" dur="5.01">things and we know that we don&apos;t have an</text><text start="2074.389" dur="4.891">educated citizenry and so you have a</text><text start="2077.48" dur="4.05">situation where people are going to get</text><text start="2079.28" dur="3.99">elected proportional to really the</text><text start="2081.53" dur="4.109">incentives of the system more than</text><text start="2083.27" dur="3.69">anything else and because people can say</text><text start="2085.639" dur="2.851">stuff that isn&apos;t true and people still</text><text start="2086.96" dur="3.419">believe it and they can do Russell</text><text start="2088.49" dur="3.839">conjugations to give people the wrong</text><text start="2090.379" dur="3.931">sense of things and appeal to emotional</text><text start="2092.329" dur="3.931">triggers and in-group defection dynamics</text><text start="2094.31" dur="3.779">and stuff like that so let&apos;s say that we</text><text start="2096.26" dur="4.079">try to make a law then of course</text><text start="2098.089" dur="3.721">everyone who has financial interest that</text><text start="2100.339" dur="2.881">would be damaged by that law supports</text><text start="2101.81" dur="3.21">the other candidate so then we have to</text><text start="2103.22" dur="3.84">do something like campaign finance</text><text start="2105.02" dur="4.589">reform but who is gonna bring the</text><text start="2107.06" dur="4.32">campaign finance reform through this</text><text start="2109.609" dur="3.51">isn&apos;t of being one of the key things is</text><text start="2111.38" dur="3.66">that the lobbyists are paid for by</text><text start="2113.119" dur="3.75">somebody the people who are working to</text><text start="2115.04" dur="4.26">change the laws continuously are paid</text><text start="2116.869" dur="4.681">for by somebody and whoever it is that</text><text start="2119.3" dur="4.38">would the ability to get money to</text><text start="2121.55" dur="4.59">someone who is campaigning also is very</text><text start="2123.68" dur="4.47">easy to hide through offshore banking</text><text start="2126.14" dur="3.689">and through third party entities and</text><text start="2128.15" dur="3.33">think tanks and whatever so because we</text><text start="2129.829" dur="3.401">don&apos;t have something like perfected</text><text start="2131.48" dur="4.24">transparent accounting if</text><text start="2133.23" dur="6.45">tried to bind incentive using law</text><text start="2135.72" dur="7.38">everyone who has the incentive to change</text><text start="2139.68" dur="5.4">that law has more resources than those</text><text start="2143.1" dur="3.96">that are trying to bind it and they end</text><text start="2145.08" dur="5.1">up basically winning and the gist there</text><text start="2147.06" dur="6.15">is that economics is deeper than law is</text><text start="2150.18" dur="5.16">in the stack of power and so you can use</text><text start="2153.21" dur="4.86">law to bind economics to a limited</text><text start="2155.34" dur="5.07">degree but let&apos;s say again the company a</text><text start="2158.07" dur="3.99">country tries to put some law forth it&apos;s</text><text start="2160.41" dur="3.449">particularly bad for a multinational</text><text start="2162.06" dur="3.15">company the multinational company says</text><text start="2163.859" dur="2.76">I&apos;ll move headquarters to another</text><text

will you know support whoever is</text><text start="2170.28" dur="3.18">campaigning against you and we&apos;ll put a</text><text start="2171.69" dur="3.99"> ton of lobbyists on changing the</text><text start="2173.46" dur="4.44">law this is all the critique of public</text><text start="2175.68" dur="4.29">choice theory is that the incentive of</text><text start="2177.9" dur="4.32">the agents in the system doesn&apos;t align</text><text start="2179.97" dur="4.56">with the well-being of the whole and the</text><text start="2182.22" dur="4.05">government is mediated by agents in the</text><text start="2184.53" dur="4.77">system and we don&apos;t have the right</text><text start="2186.27" dur="5.4">coordination dynamic so each actor doing</text><text start="2189.3" dur="4.26">kind of a utility maximization function</text><text start="2191.67" dur="3.54">each actor doing what makes the most</text><text start="2193.56" dur="3.809">sense for them in the near

dur="3.72">agency of the various actors and the</text><text start="2203.1" dur="4.56">inability to coordinate effectively</text><text start="2204.27" dur="5.52">across them and this gets worse with

exponentially</text><text start="2669.77" dur="4.29">increasingly fragile system and this is</text><text start="2672.41" dur="2.97">a way of thinking about what Tainter</text><text start="2674.06" dur="3.72">said in the collapse of complex</text><text start="2675.38" dur="4.29">societies which is the relationship</text><text start="2677.78" dur="4.32">between the complex and the

dur="3.84">breaking down and so it&apos;s important to</text><text start="2686.75" dur="3.51">know humans only know how to build</text><text start="2688.4" dur="3.72">complicated stuff we don&apos;t

is</text><text start="2698.27" dur="4.68">another kind of generator function is a</text><text start="2699.92" dur="5.7">we both have to learn how to build stuff</text><text start="2702.95"

dur="4.35">this is really different than everything</text><text start="2716.84" dur="4.62">we have ever done this is kind of one</text><text start="2718.82" dur="3.81">way of speaking about it the other thing</text><text start="2721.46" dur="3.48">that we can say is a generator function</text><text start="2722.63" dur="4.92">of X risk is that it&apos;s much easier to</text><text start="2724.94"

solution</text><text start="2766.83" dur="4.289">typically is to solve a very narrowly</text><text start="2768.869" dur="4.561">defined problem so we&apos;re defining a</text><text start="2771.119"

start="2898.769" dur="4.651">and when you add into that strategic</text><text start="2901.019" dur="4.08">agents the problem becomes I would say</text><text start="2903.42" dur="3.359">effectively impossible so what&apos;s the</text><text start="2905.099" dur="4.141">answer that basically says don&apos;t ever do</text><text start="2906.779" dur="4.381">anything yet we can&apos;t do that and this</text><text start="2909.24" dur="3.299">is the tricky thing so this is kind of</text><text start="2911.16" dur="3.57">why I say there&apos;s a something like a</text><text start="2912.539" dur="4.8">hard fork hypothesis which is if you</text><text start="2914.73" dur="4.23">look at the history of humans the</text><text start="2917.339" dur="3.69">recorded history that we have at least</text><text start="2918.96" dur="4.53">nobody would consider us very good</text><text start="2921.029" dur="4.351">stewards of power we&apos;ve used our power</text><text start="2923.49" dur="4.109">to do some lovely things and we&apos;ve also</text><text start="2925.38" dur="5.04">used our power to torture and oppress</text><text start="2927.599" dur="4.68">and kill and destroy environments and</text><text start="2930.42" dur="3.54">whatever and everybody&apos;s done that and</text><text start="2932.279" dur="4.141">the few that didn&apos;t do it got killed in</text><text start="2933.96" dur="4.47">war by those who did do it and so let&apos;s</text><text start="2936.42" dur="4.02">say there&apos;s a Gaussian distribution on</text><text start="2938.43" dur="4.379">the goodness or badness of our choices</text><text start="2940.44" dur="4.5">the rivalry or non-rivalry of how we use</text><text start="2942.809" dur="3.81">our power if we have beings that are at</text><text start="2944.94" dur="3.869">all like the beings we have been for a</text><text start="2946.619" dur="3.811">long time and you exponentially increase</text><text start="2948.809" dur="4.05">the power of those choices itself</text><text start="2950.43" dur="4.079">terminates so you can&apos;t get the power of</text><text start="2952.859" dur="3.271">gods without the love and wisdom and</text><text start="2954.509" dur="3.51">prudence of gods to guide it and have</text><text start="2956.13" dur="5.07">that be a sustainable scenario so we</text><text start="2958.019" dur="5.04">actually need humans to be safer vessels</text><text start="2961.2" dur="3.659">for power given the amount of power that</text><text start="2963.059" dur="3.841">we&apos;re coming into and we have no idea</text><text start="2964.859" dur="4.44">how to do that and what that means is we</text><text start="2966.9" dur="4.589">need a different basis for human choice</text><text start="2969.299" dur="3.661">making than we&apos;ve ever had to have the</text><text start="2971.489" dur="3.421">level of choice making power that</text><text start="2972.96" dur="4.02">exponential tech is bringing about and</text><text start="2974.91" dur="3.419">so then we have to really get into well</text><text start="2976.98" dur="3.24">why is it the humans are making the</text><text start="2978.329" dur="4.081">choices that they do and what is it that</text><text start="2980.22" dur="4.079">is conditioning the rival risk basis of</text><text start="2982.41" dur="3.54">those choices to basically have us suck</text><text start="2984.299" dur="3.601">with choices yes so we can talk about</text><text start="2985.95" dur="3.69">what are some systems that we could</text><text start="2987.9" dur="3.57">suggest get there but I would say that&apos;s</text><text start="2989.64" dur="4.949">the core of the thing that we&apos;re trying</text><text start="2991.47" dur="5.46">to address is how do we create a system</text><text start="2994.589" dur="4.71">in which any agents that are making</text><text start="2996.93" dur="4.589">choices are making choices that are not</text><text start="2999.299" dur="4.44">directly causing or indirectly causing</text><text start="3001.519" dur="2.481">harm to the system because that leads to</text><text start="3003.739" dur="2.331">the</text><text start="3004.0" dur="3.66">ratcheting of others doing that and that</text><text start="3006.07" dur="3.48">leads to self-determination and we&apos;re</text><text start="3007.66" dur="4.11">too powerful to do that so how do we get</text><text start="3009.55" dur="4.38">something like on the consideration of</text><text start="3011.77" dur="4.53">the agents leading to any positivity of</text><text start="3013.93" dur="4.08">choice making sounds nice but how do we</text><text start="3016.3" dur="3.6">do it in a world where with the ability</text><text start="3018.01" dur="4.32">to project in a complex systems</text><text start="3019.9" dur="5.07">environment the impact of any change is</text><text start="3022.33" dur="3.75">well nigh impossible I would also add</text><text start="3024.97" dur="2.49">another thing I&apos;d love to hear your</text><text start="3026.08" dur="3.51">thoughts on this one of the things we</text><text start="3027.46" dur="3.63">know from human anthropology is in</text><text start="3029.59" dur="4.98">essentially every society on earth</text><text start="3031.09" dur="6.66">somewhere between 1/2 of 1% and 2% of</text><text start="3034.57" dur="5.07">humans are sociopaths right and I&apos;d had</text><text start="3037.75" dur="4.05">in my experience as a corporate</text><text start="3039.64" dur="4.68">executive that that number may go up to</text><text start="3041.8" dur="3.93">10% or more in the c-level Suites and</text><text start="3044.32" dur="3.69">probably higher than that in the world</text><text start="3045.73" dur="4.8">of finance so we have this problem how</text><text start="3048.01" dur="4.5">do we evaluate the impact of a proposed</text><text start="3050.53" dur="4.44">change in a complex system which is</text><text start="3052.51" dur="3.81">inherently not very predictable a little</text><text start="3054.97" dur="4.62">bit predictable but we lose our ability</text><text start="3056.32" dur="5.22">to see quickly and that some noticeable</text><text start="3059.59" dur="3.72">percent of the actors you say 1% of</text><text start="3061.54" dur="3.36">sociopaths doesn&apos;t sound that bad that</text><text start="3063.31" dur="3.75">means in the United States there&apos;s 3</text><text start="3064.9" dur="4.29">million sociopaths right and they</text><text start="3067.06" dur="3.18">gravitate towards power and a lot of</text><text start="3069.19" dur="2.94">them are pretty damn good at</text><text start="3070.24" dur="5.85">manipulating people how do we get across</text><text start="3072.13" dur="6.45">those two traps yeah if I look at all of</text><text start="3076.09" dur="4.14">the cluster B personality disorders in</text><text start="3078.58" dur="3.63">the current DSM I would say they&apos;re all</text><text start="3080.23" dur="4.62">pretty concerning so you know not just</text><text start="3082.21" dur="4.92">to see Apogee but narcissism and etc but</text><text start="3084.85" dur="5.16">the most current stats I have seen were</text><text start="3087.13" dur="4.56">3 to 5 percent of the general population</text><text start="3090.01" dur="4.35">in the developed world tests for</text><text start="3091.69" dur="4.89">sociopathy and 30 percent of people in</text><text start="3094.36" dur="5.16">the c-suite of fortune 500 companies I&apos;m</text><text start="3096.58" dur="5.01">gonna share a thought on this that I</text><text start="3099.52" dur="4.05">don&apos;t have all the data to back up but I</text><text start="3101.59" dur="4.26">don&apos;t think would be hard to come up</text><text start="3103.57" dur="4.53">with so why do we get so much</text><text start="3105.85" dur="4.77">concentration of sociopathy in the top</text><text start="3108.1" dur="4.26">of fortune 500 companies and politics</text><text start="3110.62" dur="4.2">and then especially things like finance</text><text start="3112.36" dur="5.07">well because they&apos;re basically systems</text><text start="3114.82" dur="4.71">to attract reward incentivize and</text><text start="3117.43" dur="2.71">condition sociopathy because to get to</text><text start="3119.53" dur="2.56">the top</text><text start="3120.14" dur="3.6">the power game it&apos;s going to be people</text><text start="3122.09" dur="3.33">who are attracted to power and people</text><text start="3123.74" dur="4.05">who are good at winning a bunch of</text><text start="3125.42" dur="3.72">win-lose games because at each step they</text><text start="3127.79" dur="3.42">move up the ladder they&apos;re winning</text><text start="3129.14" dur="4.56">against somebody else usually the</text><text start="3131.21" dur="4.89">involving things like disinformation and</text><text start="3133.7" dur="3.87">defection and whatever it is and so if</text><text start="3136.1" dur="3.12">you think about the nature of what a</text><text start="3137.57" dur="4.08">government or a corporation or any</text><text start="3139.22" dur="4.92">top-down power system are it is</text><text start="3141.65" dur="5.04">basically a strange attractor for people</text><text start="3144.14" dur="4.2">who want to have power over for people</text><text start="3146.69" dur="4.02">who are running power dynamics and this</text><text start="3148.34" dur="4.65">is why you know let&apos;s try and save that</text><text start="3150.71" dur="3.81">I have a benevolent dictator well</text><text start="3152.99" dur="3.48">there&apos;s a reason that we don&apos;t get</text><text start="3154.52" dur="3.39">sustainable benevolent dictators is</text><text start="3156.47" dur="2.79">because let&apos;s say I have a benevolent</text><text start="3157.91" dur="3.36">dictator and we can get this in a</text><text start="3159.26" dur="5.43">corporation from great founder Theory</text><text start="3161.27" dur="5.07">sometimes because if the founder holds</text><text start="3164.69" dur="3.12">the you know majority of stock in</text><text start="3166.34" dur="3.18">whatever but it never out lives them and</text><text start="3167.81" dur="4.17">usually they end up getting kicked out</text><text start="3169.52" dur="4.71">so let&apos;s say I have a benevolent</text><text start="3171.98" dur="4.44">dictator all the people who are one step</text><text start="3174.23" dur="5.31">under them are doing things that they</text><text start="3176.42" dur="4.17">require to be able to stay as a dictator</text><text start="3179.54" dur="3.51">because it&apos;s pretty easy to kill</text><text start="3180.59" dur="4.59">somebody or to oust them or whatever so</text><text start="3183.05" dur="4.14">if I&apos;m at the top of a top-down power</text><text start="3185.18" dur="3.81">system I have to keep everybody under me</text><text start="3187.19" dur="3.51">preferring me to be above them rather</text><text start="3188.99" dur="3.21">than overthrow me which means that</text><text start="3190.7" dur="3.27">rather than do what&apos;s best for everybody</text><text start="3192.2" dur="3.27">I have to do what&apos;s best largely for</text><text start="3193.97" dur="2.91">those who are right near me and they</text><text start="3195.47" dur="3.03">have to do that for those who are under</text><text start="3196.88" dur="4.2">them and that ensures a kind of power</text><text start="3198.5" dur="3.99">law distribution of power and again</text><text start="3201.08" dur="2.79">there&apos;s like a multipolar trap on</text><text start="3202.49" dur="2.7">corruption if anyone&apos;s willing to do a</text><text start="3203.87" dur="3.6">really up thing to try and</text><text start="3205.19" dur="3.72">overthrow me I have to be able to play</text><text start="3207.47" dur="3.78">at the game of up things where I</text><text start="3208.91" dur="4.74">get overthrown so we can see how</text><text start="3211.25" dur="4.68">top-down power systems are going to both</text><text start="3213.65" dur="5.28">attract condition reward incentivize</text><text start="3215.93" dur="5.1">things like sociopathy and so then we</text><text start="3218.93" dur="3.72">end up having a world run by sociopaths</text><text start="3221.03" dur="3.93">which is not a good thing for anybody</text><text start="3222.65" dur="4.71">but now let&apos;s think about something like</text><text start="3224.96" dur="3.93">a tribe and I&apos;m not gonna over</text><text start="3227.36" dur="3.27">romanticize here I&apos;m just kind of</text><text start="3228.89" dur="5.16">thinking through the dynamics in a first</text><text start="3230.63" dur="4.17">principles way if I&apos;ve got 40 50 70 up</text><text start="3234.05" dur="3.12">to</text><text start="3234.8" dur="4.83">our number of people living in a tribe</text><text start="3237.17" dur="4.41">there&apos;s an extraordinarily high degree</text><text start="3239.63" dur="3.51">of transparency that is forced in that</text><text start="3241.58" dur="2.37">scenario everybody pretty much sees</text><text start="3243.14" dur="2.55">everything that&apos;s going on with</text><text start="3243.95" dur="3.3">everybody and everybody knows everyone</text><text start="3245.69" dur="4.23">everyone has fealty relationships with</text><text start="3247.25" dur="4.32">everybody in the tribe so sociopathy is</text><text start="3249.92" dur="3.72">not gonna be advantageous you&apos;re not</text><text start="3251.57" dur="5.76">going to have an evolutionary niche in</text><text start="3253.64" dur="6.24">that environment for much in the way of</text><text start="3257.33" dur="5.07">conspiring and lying because it will get</text><text start="3259.88" dur="4.98">found out and it will get punished and</text><text start="3262.4" dur="4.32">so the forced transparency creates an</text><text start="3264.86" dur="3.75">accounting system where you don&apos;t get an</text><text start="3266.72" dur="4.41">evolutionary niche for somebody</text><text start="3268.61" dur="4.41">the other people in the system and so as</text><text start="3271.13" dur="4.59">soon as the system starts to get large</text><text start="3273.02" dur="4.23">enough then one there&apos;s anonymous people</text><text start="3275.72" dur="3.0">so I can harm people who I don&apos;t really</text><text start="3277.25" dur="3.63">know and care about as opposed to</text><text start="3278.72" dur="3.51">everybody who is in the system as</text><text start="3280.88" dur="3.84">somebody that I know and care about and</text><text start="3282.23" dur="4.26">two I can do stuff that people won&apos;t be</text><text start="3284.72" dur="3.15">able to see they can kind of have a</text><text start="3286.49" dur="3.69">corruption of the accounting in the</text><text start="3287.87" dur="5.25">system now we get an evolutionary niche</text><text start="3290.18" dur="5.58">for rather than participating with the</text><text start="3293.12" dur="4.29">system doing internal defection I&apos;m not</text><text start="3295.76" dur="3.48">externally defecting and leaving the</text><text start="3297.41" dur="4.74">system I&apos;m internally defecting and</text><text start="3299.24" dur="4.62">playing the system and that&apos;s what most</text><text start="3302.15" dur="3.6">everyone inside of a corporation or a</text><text start="3303.86" dur="3.18">government is optimizing what is good</text><text start="3305.75" dur="2.91">for them and their direct fealty</text><text start="3307.04" dur="3.32">relationships rather than what&apos;s good</text><text start="3308.66" dur="4.65">for the whole and nobody can tell and</text><text start="3310.36" dur="4.51">this is a particularly hard scenario but</text><text start="3313.31" dur="4.83">the reason I&apos;m saying this is because we</text><text start="3314.87" dur="5.61">do our social science inside of a world</text><text start="3318.14" dur="4.29">where these systems have become a Bic</text><text start="3320.48" dur="4.05">with us and then we assume that those</text><text start="3322.43" dur="3.75">properties where there&apos;s ubiquitous</text><text start="3324.53" dur="3.6">conditioning are intrinsic to human</text><text start="3326.18" dur="3.51">nature and I think we have to be very</text><text start="3328.13" dur="3.12">careful about that I think a lot of them</text><text start="3329.69" dur="3.66">are not intrinsic to human nature they</text><text start="3331.25" dur="3.45">are a result of the ubiquitous</text><text start="3333.35" dur="2.91">conditioning and we could create</text><text start="3334.7" dur="3.99">conditioning environments in which</text><text start="3336.26" dur="4.17">things like sociopathy are just not</text><text start="3338.69" dur="3.66">advantageous and so they don&apos;t get up</text><text start="3340.43" dur="4.44">regulated the answer probably just seem</text><text start="3342.35" dur="4.77">to find sociopaths the varying ratios</text><text start="3344.87" dur="4.17">that they find them at a least half a</text><text start="3347.12" dur="4.02">percent ratio pretty much every place</text><text start="3349.04" dur="4.2">and in fact I&apos;ve thrown a challenge out</text><text start="3351.14" dur="3.69">some anthropologist so they&apos;ve not been</text><text start="3353.24" dur="4.08">able to reject it one of the big</text><text start="3354.83" dur="5.25">questions and anthropology is how did</text><text start="3357.32" dur="5.07">human society transition from chiefdoms</text><text start="3360.08" dur="4.68">to early States and</text><text start="3362.39" dur="4.25">my conjecture has been that it&apos;s based</text><text start="3364.76" dur="4.41">on the arrival of a sufficiently</text><text start="3366.64" dur="4.75">charismatic sociopath and that&apos;s the</text><text start="3369.17" dur="4.29">story right and they&apos;ve pulled their</text><text start="3371.39" dur="3.84">beards and that&apos;s an interesting theory</text><text start="3373.46" dur="3.45">here&apos;s even some ways to measure it so I</text><text start="3375.23" dur="2.97">think if we&apos;re gonna design a social</text><text start="3376.91" dur="3.959">operating system we&apos;re gonna have to</text><text start="3378.2" dur="4.889">assume some levels sociopathy and have</text><text start="3380.869" dur="4.021">some defense mechanisms for saying well</text><text start="3383.089" dur="4.381">so let&apos;s go ahead and do the analogy and</text><text start="3384.89" dur="5.25">say that sociopathy within a social body</text><text start="3387.47" dur="5.549">is like a cancer cell inside of a animal</text><text start="3390.14" dur="4.59">body which

this you know kind of</text><text start="3410.15" dur="4.23">radically necessarily symbiotic</text><text start="3411.95" dur="3.69">relationship now a cancer cell realizes</text><text start="3414.38" dur="3.09">that it can actually consume and</text><text start="3415.64" dur="3.959">reproduce faster if it defects on the</text><text start="3417.47" dur="4.319">agreement and that happens all the

the first things I can talk about</text><text start="3590.76" dur="6.9">is that as long as the defect on the</text><text start="3594.42" dur="5.22">whole is more advantageous just two</text><text

it it will happen and</text><text start="3602.67" dur="3.09">so you have to have the kinds of</text><text start="3604.26" dur="3.24">accounting that keep that from occurring</text><text start="3605.76" dur="3.42">and the other thing is as long as</text><text start="3607.5" dur="3.96">individuals can</text><text start="3609.18" dur="3.81">become psychologically damaged and have</text><text start="3611.46" dur="3.81">that not be noticed and still have</text><text start="3612.99" dur="4.109">access to power that&apos;s also a problem so</text><text start="3615.27" dur="4.829">there is a process by which the</text><text start="3617.099" dur="5.46">psychologic health of people has to be</text><text start="3620.099" dur="4.531">noticed and the process by which the</text><text start="3622.559" dur="4.111">social system has to be more</text><text start="3624.63" dur="4.199">advantageous to participate with and to</text><text start="3626.67" dur="4.859">defect against you have some ideas and</text><text start="3628.829" dur="4.95">how we might structure this sound like a</text><text start="3631.529" dur="4.171">cell network essentially where people</text><text start="3633.779" dur="4.681">are assembled at the Dunbar number or</text><text start="3635.7" dur="4.56">below in an intense solid way and</text><text start="3638.46" dur="3.3">presumably with minimal ability to</text><text start="3640.26" dur="3.72">migrate because we all know that the</text><text start="3641.76" dur="3.72">stranger in town is a much

really bothersome I</text><text start="3654.029" dur="3.421">don&apos;t know of any model where that&apos;s</text><text start="3655.95" dur="3.75">accomplishable as long as there&apos;s</text><text start="3657.45" dur="5.159">private property okay we certainly have</text><text start="3659.7" dur="5.46">alternatives such as syndicalism which</text><text start="3662.609" dur="4.561">is quasi private property but not in the</text><text start="3665.16" dur="4.35">same sense we have here and then there&apos;s</text><text start="3667.17" dur="3.99">an RG which is another similar model so</text><text start="3669.51" dur="2.91">I don&apos;t think we have to keep private</text><text start="3671.16" dur="2.82">property on the table so I would</text><text start="3672.42" dur="2.85">entertain any proposal that you think</text><text start="3673.98" dur="4.23">could implement this theory</text><text start="3675.27" dur="4.5">I think if organs believed that they</text><text start="3678.21" dur="3.27">could live at the expense of the other</text><text start="3679.77" dur="3.089">ones and that a famine might come so</text><text start="3681.48" dur="2.43">they needed to hoard resource because</text><text start="3682.859" dur="2.371">they wouldn&apos;t be able to get it from</text><text start="3683.91" dur="3.689">other ones and they were actually in</text><text start="3685.23" dur="3.99">competition for scarce resource we&apos;d be</text><text start="3687.599" dur="4.2"> right the body would break down</text><text start="3689.22" dur="4.829">very very quickly and so you don&apos;t see</text><text start="3691.799" dur="3.901">the coordination dynamics of cells or</text><text start="3694.049" dur="2.76">organs or tissues involving something</text><text start="3695.7" dur="3.149">like private property you have a</text><text start="3696.809" dur="3.78">situation where things are stored</text><text start="3698.849" dur="3.21">wherever they&apos;re stored the calcium</text><text start="3700.589" dur="3.421">stored in the bones fat cells are so</text><text start="3702.059" dur="4.081">really they are for the utilization by</text><text start="3704.01" dur="4.17">any part of the system that needs it as</text><text start="3706.14" dur="4.199">it&apos;s needed so you don&apos;t have a</text><text start="3708.18" dur="4.2">situation where any cell or organ has a</text><text start="3710.339" dur="3.421">Delta between what&apos;s good for it and</text><text start="3712.38" dur="3.12">what&apos;s good for the whole cuz it depends</text><text start="3713.76" dur="3.359">upon the rest of the whole I do believe</text><text start="3715.5" dur="4.14">that we have to create a similar thing</text><text start="3717.119" dur="4.98">in the human systems and specifically my</text><text start="3719.64" dur="4.29">ability to increase my own private</text><text start="3722.099" dur="5.821">property ownership my own balance sheet</text><text start="3723.93" dur="6.24">increases my quality of life not only</text><text start="3727.92" dur="4.35">can ID couple that from you or the</text><text start="3730.17" dur="3.96">Commons I can ante couple it I can</text><text start="3732.27" dur="2.9">directly the Commons or you</text><text start="3734.13" dur="3.02">and get ahead in that way</text><text start="3735.17" dur="4.889">that becomes the basis for misaligned</text><text start="3737.15" dur="4.83">agency and I think we assume that basis</text><text start="3740.059" dur="3.691">for misaligned agency kind of across the</text><text start="3741.98" dur="3.839">board and of course I&apos;m not going to</text><text start="3743.75" dur="3.39">present something like Marxism but I</text><text start="3745.819" dur="3.121">think if you actually study something</text><text start="3747.14" dur="3.209">like how the resource provisioning of</text><text start="3748.94" dur="3.359">something like a Body Works</text><text start="3750.349" dur="3.841">it is obviously neither socialism or</text><text start="3752.299" dur="3.81">Marxism or capitalism it&apos;s a much more</text><text start="3754.19" dur="5.28">complex system with different underlying</text><text start="3756.109" dur="5.671">axioms and so let&apos;s say that rather than</text><text start="3759.47" dur="4.71">you possess a good in order to have</text><text start="3761.78" dur="3.63">access to it your capacity to access it</text><text start="3764.18" dur="3.0">is to be a possession but your</text><text start="3765.41" dur="3.84">possession means that I no longer have</text><text start="3767.18" dur="3.81">access to it and the scarce or something</text><text start="3769.25" dur="3.869">is the more value we give to it so then</text><text start="3770.99" dur="4.05">we also have a incentive to create</text><text start="3773.119" dur="3.74">artificial scarcity because abundance</text><text start="3775.04" dur="4.41">makes the stuff not worth anything and</text><text start="3776.859" dur="4.061">you also then have an incentive to</text><text start="3779.45" dur="3.119">possess more stuff than you need</text><text start="3780.92" dur="3.389">especially when you get compounding</text><text start="3782.569" dur="4.26">returns on the stuff that you have so</text><text start="3784.309" dur="4.711">your incentive is to extract as much it</text><text start="3786.829" dur="4.02">is possible to drive scarcity in the</text><text start="3789.02" dur="3.66">system to hoard information to cause</text><text start="3790.849" dur="4.531">disinformation all of those things</text><text start="3792.68" dur="5.01">associated with the private

dur="4.831">I&apos;m not stoked on you owning stuff right</text><text start="3802.309" dur="4.351">I&apos;m actually don&apos;t want you to own the</text><text start="3804.68" dur="4.2">stuff I want

start="3810.829" dur="4.891">your access doesn&apos;t remove my access via</text><text start="3813.44" dur="4.409">possession like shopping carts at the</text><text start="3815.72" dur="4.8">grocery

dur="3.18">obviously be more difficult so you</text><text start="3826.28" dur="3.45">having access to smother me a dog</text><text start="3827.96" dur="3.69">doesn&apos;t live in my access we start to</text><text start="3829.73" dur="3.42">say how many places could this be the</text><text start="3831.65" dur="4.02">case and we see that with the sharing</text><text start="3833.15" dur="4.709">economy we could replace transportation</text><text start="3835.67" dur="4.74">comprehensively with common wealth</text><text start="3837.859" dur="5.791">shared resources rather than

dur="3.06">something like a twentieth of the total</text><text start="3847.19" dur="2.909">number that are there now have them be</text><text start="3848.54" dur="4.559">higher quality for everybody and</text><text start="3850.099" dur="5.191">obviously lower accidents higher quality</text><text start="3853.099" dur="3.331">much lower cost to civilization because</text><text start="3855.29" dur="2.87">you don&apos;t have a bunch of grotesque</text><text start="3856.43" dur="3.17">duplication and you don&apos;t have</text><text start="3858.16" dur="2.97">having to go to marketing budgets

dur="3.75">designed in obsolescence you have</text><text start="3864.1" dur="3.99">modular upgrade ability built right into</text><text start="3866.26" dur="4.08">the system so you can see a much

dur="5.94">then remove the destructive competitive</text><text start="3875.74" dur="5.31">dynamics in doing so now let&apos;s say that</text><text start="3879.01" dur="3.75">rather than have a central

some other folks cooked</text><text start="4046.79" dur="4.26">up fairly naive political program</text><text start="4048.83" dur="4.71">several years ago and we identified</text><text start="4051.05" dur="4.14">maximizing self-actualization as the</text><text start="4053.54" dur="3.39">highest goal and we weren&apos;t as</text><text start="4055.19" dur="3.42">structured as this thinking but we had</text><text start="4056.93" dur="3.15">some things that were moving in this</text><text start="4058.61" dur="4.32">direction which eventually became a</text><text start="4060.08" dur="4.5">concept

start="4067.37" dur="4.83">that critical mass of us that there was</text><text start="4069.65" dur="5.04">a reasonable way to get from here to</text><text start="4072.2" dur="4.8">there you know the

start="4091.82" dur="5.37">that transition from game a to game B is</text><text start="4095.21" dur="4.92">the part that so far many of us have</text><text start="4097.19" dur="5.55">never seen a

start="4104.57" dur="4.59">have to say that we have a set of</text><text start="4107.05" dur="3.72">architectures that mean necessary and</text><text start="4109.16" dur="4.04">sufficient criteria

might be more</text><text start="4189.79" dur="3.45">controversial but I don&apos;t think it</text><text start="4191.29" dur="3.75">should be let&apos;s take a look at biotech</text><text start="4193.24" dur="3.24">and health research there&apos;s a whole</text><text start="4195.04" dur="2.94">bunch of that makes sense to</text><text start="4196.48" dur="3.51">research where there&apos;s just no money to</text><text start="4197.98" dur="3.93">research it so we did so much work in</text><text start="4199.99" dur="3.45">small molecules because they were</text><text start="4201.91" dur="3.0">patentable and it was really critical</text><text start="4203.44" dur="2.91">they were patentable because if I had to</text><text start="4204.91" dur="2.67">go through FDA trials that cost a</text><text start="4206.35" dur="3.3">billion dollars and I needed to make</text><text start="4207.58" dur="3.81">that money back I had to be able to have</text><text

were only gonna research it</text><text start="4215.11" dur="3.15">was patentable the patentable stuff was</text><text start="4216.82" dur="2.34">only gonna be synthetic stuff because</text><text start="4218.26" dur="2.61">you don&apos;t want people to be able to</text><text start="4219.16" dur="3.99">patent intrinsic parts of humans or</text><text start="4220.87" dur="4.17">nature so that means that anything that</text><text start="4223.15" dur="3.78">was a part of how my body worked when I</text><text start="4225.04" dur="4.02">was healthy doesn&apos;t get to be something</text><text

dur="3.51">cure and that&apos;s the only shortened</text><text start="4241.0" dur="3.6">research and of course I live in a world</text><text start="4242.74" dur="3.75">where war is more likely in

the</text><text start="4253.57" dur="4.92">wealthiest people if they are willing to</text><text start="4255.4" dur="5.43">think about it can recognize that the</text><text start="4258.49" dur="4.53">world that we are discussing if it was</text><text start="4260.83" dur="4.38">possible as comprehensively better for</text><text start="4263.02" dur="4.68">them and the current world is the

dur="3.81">that&apos;s good news actually and of course</text><text start="4293.11" dur="4.59">you know I think ecocide is at now</text><text start="4295.39" dur="5.28">becoming the forcing function anyone who</text><text start="4297.7" dur="5.52">is really thinking seriously about this</text><text start="4300.67" dur="4.62">stuff has to realize that we are have</text><text start="4303.22" dur="4.17">either already overshot or are about to</text><text start="4305.29" dur="4.35">overshot the carrying capacity of the</text><text start="4307.39" dur="3.78">earth and that alone ought to be a</text><text start="4309.64" dur="3.63">pretty strong argument to go on a</text><text start="4311.17" dur="3.9">different road but as we talked about</text><text start="4313.27" dur="3.72">before

dur="3.0">pecking order that&apos;s a big lift to get</text><text start="4325.51" dur="3.72">three hundred and thirty million</text><text start="4326.53" dur="4.67">Americans let alone a billion people in</text><text start="4329.23" dur="4.89">the world to retreat from the game a</text><text start="4331.2" dur="5.62">hierarchical fractal structure and move</text><text start="4334.12" dur="4.29">towards something else yeah everyone is</text><text start="4336.82" dur="3.54">stuck in a kind of multipolar trap</text><text start="4338.41" dur="3.18">regarding incapacity to

dur="3.0">makes sense but I have no idea how to</text><text start="4344.65" dur="2.55">build a new system and I have no idea</text><text start="4346.0" dur="2.85">how to get people to participate with a</text><text start="4347.2" dur="3.36">new system and as long as other people</text><text start="4348.85" dur="3.03">are doing the thing then it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="4350.56" dur="2.73">seem like there is any other game for me</text><text start="4351.88" dur="3.18">to play it&apos;s kind of like there is</text><text start="4353.29" dur="3.51">really only one game in town so if we</text><text start="4355.06" dur="3.09">can even take like let&apos;s say kilo and</text><text start="4356.8" dur="2.46">musk as an interesting example where</text><text start="4358.15" dur="2.97">okay argue</text><text start="4359.26" dur="4.26">one of the highest agency people in the</text><text start="4361.12" dur="4.02">world currently right and after he came</text><text start="4363.52" dur="3.66">across boström stuff he became very</text><text start="4365.14" dur="5.01">concerned about existential risk from</text><text start="4367.18" dur="4.71">AGI created open ai to work on it and</text><text start="4370.15" dur="3.81">then when you saw him on Joe Rogan a few</text><text start="4371.89" dur="4.47">months ago he was saying I spent years</text><text start="4373.96" dur="4.02">trying to get the world to understand</text><text start="4376.36" dur="3.96">this AGI issue and to create different</text><text start="4377.98" dur="4.86">you know safety

start="4385.03" dur="3.33">do anything about it and I basically</text><text start="4386.05" dur="4.56">have kind of given up on being able to</text><text start="4388.36" dur="4.02">protect against this risk and all we can</text><text start="4390.61" dur="4.23">do now is just hope that the risk isn&apos;t</text><text start="4392.38" dur="4.83">terrible and try to mitigate it so if</text><text start="4394.84" dur="4.47">even the most agentic powerful people</text><text start="4397.21" dur="3.96">feel like they actually don&apos;t have the</text><text start="4399.31" dur="4.26">capacity to do anything in the presence</text><text start="4401.17" dur="3.99">of you know multipolar trap type dynamic</text><text start="4403.57" dur="3.48">since like alright how do you do it this</text><text start="4405.16" dur="3.81">is the transition question well one</text><text start="4407.05" dur="3.63">thing is the what is the new thing you</text><text start="4408.97" dur="3.9">transition to has never been adequately</text><text start="4410.68" dur="4.23">specified so we have to be able to</text><text start="4412.87" dur="3.51">specify something that meets the</text><text start="4414.91" dur="3.03">solution to these generator functions</text><text start="4416.38" dur="3.63">and again that&apos;s a longer conversation</text><text start="4417.94" dur="3.27">but we could go further we&apos;re starting</text><text start="4420.01" dur="3.48">to lay some of the ground work and as</text><text start="4421.21" dur="4.44">far as transition goes I&apos;ll share one</text><text start="4423.49" dur="3.54">example of a way to think about it I&apos;m</text><text start="4425.65" dur="3.15">not saying this is how it will happen</text><text start="4427.03" dur="4.14">I&apos;m saying this at least provides a</text><text start="4428.8" dur="5.34">thought experiment first there is no</text><text start="4431.17" dur="4.62">such thing as sustained competitive</text><text start="4434.14" dur="3.36">advantage from a single innovation</text><text start="4435.79" dur="4.35">because if I have an innovation whether</text><text start="4437.5" dur="5.58">it&apos;s better extraction tech or economic</text><text start="4440.14" dur="5.88">tech or social tech or warfare tech the</text><text start="4443.08" dur="4.02">moment I deploy that capacity then</text><text start="4446.02" dur="2.97">everyone else will see it</text><text start="4447.1" dur="3.81">reverse-engineer it you know make their</text><text start="4448.99" dur="3.81">own kind of innovations on it and so</text><text start="4450.91" dur="4.59">sustained competitive advantage is an</text><text start="4452.8" dur="4.47">ongoing innovation competition which is</text><text start="4455.5" dur="3.6">the up ratcheting of rival risk power</text><text start="4457.27" dur="4.23">which is the dynamic that we&apos;re looking</text><text start="4459.1" dur="3.6">at here and so there&apos;s this question</text><text start="4461.5" dur="2.79">most people get stuck in which is like</text><text start="4462.7" dur="3.42">okay well the current system seems to be</text><text start="4464.29" dur="4.83">self terminating so if we need to make a</text><text start="4466.12" dur="5.1">new system that outcompetes this system</text><text start="4469.12" dur="3.78">what source of asymmetric advantage over</text><text start="4471.22" dur="3.27">the current system is it gonna have and</text><text start="4472.9" dur="3.18">how does that not just is that not just</text><text start="4474.49" dur="2.73">part of the same power game because</text><text start="4476.08" dur="1.8">we&apos;re used to thinking in terms of</text><text start="4477.22" dur="2.22">outcompetes</text><text start="4477.88" dur="3.9">and so like if you think historically</text><text start="4479.44" dur="4.86">that there were less violent cultures</text><text start="4481.78" dur="4.38">that invested less in military and more</text><text start="4484.3" dur="3.1">in quality of life Arts and Sciences and</text><text start="4486.16" dur="2.53">humanity and lived in more</text><text start="4487.4"

start="4513.469" dur="3.511">competing at the game of power so</text><text start="4515.12" dur="4.8">what is the option so there&apos;s a question</text><text start="4516.98" dur="6.0">of what could provide increased capacity</text><text start="4519.92" dur="5.279">that can&apos;t be weaponized that&apos;s a very</text><text start="4522.98" dur="6.3">interesting question we could say that</text><text start="4525.199" dur="7.081">every technology that increases capacity</text><text start="4529.28" dur="4.77">can be weaponized meaning can be used by</text><text start="4532.28" dur="3.84">some agent to increase their capacity</text><text start="4534.05" dur="5.1">relative to other agents or the commons</text><text start="4536.12" dur="4.829">except if we had a social

dur="4.48">capacity you actually can&apos;t weaponize it</text><text start="4545.54" dur="4.889">because it is the solvent for weapon</text><text start="4547.159" dur="5.431">ization itself it is actually the basis</text><text start="4550.429" dur="4.861">of how agents interact in a way that</text><text start="4552.59" dur="5.52">doesn&apos;t incentivize weapons and so for</text><text start="4555.29" dur="4.71">anyone to instantiate that thing they</text><text start="4558.11" dur="4.23">are actually changing the nature of</text><text start="4560.0" dur="4.56">their agency so in the

the expense of the</text><text start="4582.409" dur="3.691">whole so I had both the right kind of</text><text start="4584.03" dur="4.29">transparency and accounting systems and</text><text

things like that then we</text><text start="4591.65" dur="4.92">can have a situation where no one let&apos;s</text><text start="4594.35" dur="5.849">just say if we could invent a situation</text><text

dur="4.41">you would get a situation where you had</text><text start="4620.13" dur="5.85">an information ecology that was actually</text><text start="4622.53" dur="5.64">intact at a larger scale that would lead</text><text start="4625.98" dur="4.05">to radically better capacity to</text><text start="4628.17" dur="3.18">coordinate and innovate better since</text><text start="4630.03" dur="2.94">making the current system has in that</text><text start="4631.35" dur="3.48">system as a whole would be more</text><text start="4632.97" dur="3.66">effective at producing all of the</text><text start="4634.83" dur="3.72">metrics that matter relative to total</text><text start="4636.63" dur="5.52">resource per capita than any current</text><text start="4638.55" dur="5.67">system would be and I only need a small</text><text start="4642.15" dur="3.63">number of people relatively small number</text><text start="4644.22" dur="3.75">of people who get that and want to</text><text start="4645.78" dur="4.26">instantiate it as a new full stack</text><text start="4647.97" dur="4.17">civilization to create a new strange</text><text start="4650.04" dur="3.87">attractor or a new attractor Basin where</text><text start="4652.14" dur="3.33">anyone else looking at it says well</text><text start="4653.91" dur="4.17">quality of life is higher on every</text><text start="4655.47" dur="4.29">metric there and they&apos;re also able to</text><text start="4658.08" dur="2.97">innovate us on a bunch of things they&apos;re</text><text start="4659.76" dur="2.55">figuring out solutions to that we</text><text start="4661.05" dur="3.27">don&apos;t have well then why don&apos;t we just</text><text start="4662.31" dur="3.72">kill them well because they aren&apos;t</text><text start="4664.32" dur="3.53">trying to win the game of power against</text><text start="4666.03" dur="4.2">us they aren&apos;t building militaries or</text><text start="4667.85" dur="3.76">signaling or narrative warfare to try</text><text start="4670.23" dur="3.6">and beat us and actually they&apos;re</text><text start="4671.61" dur="4.17">exporting solutions to us that we need</text><text start="4673.83" dur="3.66">to the rest of the world because if they</text><text start="4675.78" dur="3.18">have increased capacity to innovate and</text><text start="4677.49" dur="2.52">solve problems because they can actually</text><text start="4678.96" dur="2.34">coordinate better because they don&apos;t</text><text start="4680.01" dur="2.76">have disinformation information</text><text start="4681.3" dur="2.88">withholding then they can look at what</text><text start="4682.77" dur="3.96">groups that would otherwise have enmity</text><text start="4684.18" dur="4.11">with them actually need develop those</text><text start="4686.73" dur="2.79">solutions and create dependents rather</text><text start="4688.29" dur="2.85">than enmity relationships while</text><text start="4689.52" dur="3.03">simultaneously saying if you want to</text><text start="4691.14" dur="3.0">know how to do this as well we&apos;ve</text><text start="4692.55" dur="2.91">actually open sourced it it&apos;s a social</text><text start="4694.14" dur="2.97">technology you&apos;re welcome to use the</text><text start="4695.46" dur="2.85">social technology but the social</text><text start="4697.11" dur="3.06">technology will fundamentally change</text><text start="4698.31" dur="3.81">your basis for agency if you employ it</text><text start="4700.17" dur="3.54">so obviously there&apos;s a million things we</text><text start="4702.12" dur="3.9">would need to dig into there but just</text><text start="4703.71" dur="4.8">the thought experiment goes fast the</text><text start="4706.02" dur="4.29">doctors build a new ground-up system</text><text start="4708.51" dur="4.29">where the new ground-up system becomes a</text><text start="4710.31" dur="4.83">new attractive Basin and you know that&apos;s</text><text start="4712.8" dur="4.32">a way of thinking about that I don&apos;t try</text><text start="4715.14" dur="3.599">and if I have to shift at the level of</text><text start="4717.12" dur="3.599">axioms I can&apos;t retrofit</text><text start="4718.739" dur="3.871">current system I have to build something</text><text start="4720.719" dur="4.141">but if the thing that I build is</text><text start="4722.61" dur="4.859">fundamentally more attractive ground up</text><text start="4724.86" dur="4.409">then I only need fast adopters to</text><text start="4727.469" dur="3.991">understand it in concept to have medium</text><text start="4729.269" dur="4.56">adopters understand that after seeing</text><text start="4731.46" dur="4.02">its implementation I really like that</text><text start="4733.829" dur="3.571">and in fact when you were talking about</text><text start="4735.48" dur="3.929">the lack of sustainable competitive</text><text start="4737.4" dur="3.69">advantage from any single innovation I</text><text start="4739.409" dur="4.411">was thinking there&apos;s a soft counter</text><text start="4741.09" dur="4.679">example it&apos;s not good forever but it&apos;s</text><text start="4743.82" dur="4.949">what we call network effects right and</text><text start="4745.769" dur="5.071">if we spend what you just said a little</text><text start="4748.769" dur="5.25">bit suppose we were able to create a</text><text start="4750.84" dur="6.239">strong beneficial Network effect to</text><text start="4754.019" dur="5.131">people who played by positive generative</text><text start="4757.079" dur="4.111">rules and did so in a way that was not</text><text start="4759.15" dur="3.54">directly threatening back to people who</text><text start="4761.19" dur="3.84">didn&apos;t play by the rules but because</text><text start="4762.69" dur="4.59">these people were better sense makers</text><text start="4765.03" dur="4.799">and choice makers they actually could</text><text start="4767.28" dur="4.35">create things to trade back to people</text><text start="4769.829" dur="4.321">who aren&apos;t on the network and of course</text><text start="4771.63" dur="4.409">as we know the early adopter a types</text><text start="4774.15" dur="4.139">will come and join the network and once</text><text start="4776.039" dur="4.471">it&apos;s proven to be more successful per</text><text start="4778.289" dur="5.011">unit of human effort at both well being</text><text start="4780.51" dur="4.35">but also importantly actual creation the</text><text start="4783.3" dur="3.449">next layer of people will come in if</text><text start="4784.86" dur="3.6">only to hang out with the A&apos;s and then</text><text start="4786.749" dur="3.151">you make that as you said I think this</text><text start="4788.46" dur="3.0">was the brilliant part that I hadn&apos;t</text><text start="4789.9" dur="4.739">thought of before you make the ground</text><text start="4791.46" dur="6.0">rules such that anyone who becomes a</text><text start="4794.639" dur="5.79">member has essentially committed to a</text><text start="4797.46" dur="5.009">doctrine which is subversive of the</text><text start="4800.429" dur="4.32">previous paradigm but in a subtle way</text><text start="4802.469" dur="4.38">not directly challenging at just a value</text><text start="4804.749" dur="3.961">orientation and a set of rules for</text><text start="4806.849" dur="3.841">dealing with each other and this again</text><text start="4808.71" dur="4.409">gets very much back to the original</text><text start="4810.69" dur="4.11">naive spirit of game B where one of the</text><text start="4813.119" dur="4.531">things we did was gave ourselves all the</text><text start="4814.8" dur="4.02">title of peer we always said that when</text><text start="4817.65" dur="4.409">you&apos;re dealing with another game B</text><text start="4818.82" dur="5.339">person you have a moral obligation of</text><text start="4822.059" dur="4.111">considerable power to deal with them as</text><text start="4824.159" dur="3.931">a peer irrespective of any other</text><text start="4826.17" dur="4.079">different other dimensions of power</text><text start="4828.09" dur="4.56">differences and so if this strong</text><text start="4830.249" dur="4.231">beneficial Network effect system had as</text><text start="4832.65" dur="3.33">an example that anyone who&apos;s a member of</text><text start="4834.48" dur="4.17">it is within the constraints of the</text><text start="4835.98" dur="5.699">system at least a true peer that would</text><text start="4838.65" dur="6.719">be very interesting yeah so I can only</text><text start="4841.679" dur="6.0">compete on a define and narrow metric</text><text start="4845.369" dur="4.731">right so if we&apos;re competing over who has</text><text start="4847.679" dur="3.861">more money or who&apos;s taller who can run</text><text start="4850.1" dur="4.35">then we can just have a straight-up</text><text start="4851.54" dur="5.25">competition but how do I compare dolly</text><text start="4854.45" dur="4.29">techer it&apos;s a up thing right you</text><text start="4856.79" dur="4.14">actually kind of can&apos;t do that in a</text><text start="4858.74" dur="4.23">meaningful way and any way that you try</text><text start="4860.93" dur="3.9">to say well here&apos;s a metric or some set</text><text start="4862.97" dur="3.54">of metrics with which to assess that</text><text start="4864.83" dur="3.36">you&apos;ve actually reduced the thing to</text><text start="4866.51" dur="4.44">something it isn&apos;t and so you could</text><text start="4868.19" dur="4.74">imagine that an usher and a dolly could</text><text start="4870.95" dur="3.42">interact with each other in a way where</text><text start="4872.93" dur="2.91">they both acknowledge that each other</text><text start="4874.37" dur="2.79">are bringing something to the world that</text><text start="4875.84" dur="2.79">is actually enriching the world and</text><text start="4877.16" dur="2.88">beautiful that they aren&apos;t bringing and</text><text start="4878.63" dur="3.18">that they&apos;re stoked each other doing it</text><text start="4880.04" dur="3.09">and there&apos;s no hierarchy intrinsic in</text><text start="4881.81" dur="2.7">that and I&apos;m not saying there are never</text><text start="4883.13" dur="3.6">healthy hierarchies but I&apos;m saying in</text><text start="4884.51" dur="4.11">general rather than a competition on a</text><text start="4886.73" dur="4.37">very narrow metric which is inherently</text><text start="4888.62" dur="5.52">information reduction we are seeking</text><text start="4891.1" dur="6.06">self-actualization of rich creativity</text><text start="4894.14" dur="5.67">and that intrinsically can&apos;t be</text><text start="4897.16" dur="5.59">holistically compared in the same way so</text><text start="4899.81" dur="4.86">that&apos;s one big part of it and the other</text><text start="4902.75" dur="3.3">part of it is you know that you and I</text><text start="4904.67" dur="2.7">had a conversation the other day Jim</text><text start="4906.05" dur="2.37">where you said something and you and I</text><text start="4907.37" dur="3.18">are just getting to know each other and</text><text start="4908.42" dur="4.41">like I instantly loved you because of it</text><text start="4910.55" dur="5.13">because you said anyone who would abuse</text><text start="4912.83" dur="4.08">people with a below 90 IQ I want to beat</text><text start="4915.68" dur="3.33">their head and with a baseball bat or</text><text start="4916.91" dur="3.24">something like that and you wanted to</text><text start="4919.01" dur="3.27">see that those who have more</text><text start="4920.15" dur="3.9">intelligence are actually protective of</text><text start="4922.28" dur="3.99">rather than exploiting of those who</text><text start="4924.05" dur="4.05">couldn&apos;t compete so then the question is</text><text start="4926.27" dur="3.78">what made you that way and how do we</text><text start="4928.1" dur="4.05">create social systems where to the</text><text start="4930.05" dur="4.14">extent that anyone has obviously</text><text start="4932.15" dur="5.04">increased capacity over anyone else</text><text start="4934.19" dur="4.74">they&apos;re actually oriented to steward</text><text start="4937.19" dur="3.75">everyone else rather than use that in an</text><text start="4938.93" dur="4.56">exploitive way and I think this is</text><text start="4940.94" dur="4.71">conditional both at the level of social</text><text start="4943.49" dur="4.35">values and at the level of the way</text><text start="4945.65"
