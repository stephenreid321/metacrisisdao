dur="3.75">with dr. hill today&apos;s guest is Daniel</text><text start="12.48" dur="4.529">schmuck Tim burger who is a co-founder</text><text start="14.07" dur="5.519">and R&amp;D director of the neuro hacker</text><text start="17.009" dur="4.951">collective which sounds kind of exciting</text><text start="19.589" dur="3.99">so Dan is going to tell us all kinds of</text><text start="21.96" dur="2.639">cool things today and dig into his</text><text start="23.579" dur="3.09">history a little bit and some of the</text><text start="24.599" dur="3.72">projects he&apos;s working on so welcome to</text><text start="26.669" dur="2.67">the show today Daniel thanks for having</text><text start="28.319" dur="3.151">me it&apos;s good to be here with you yeah</text><text start="29.339" dur="4.29">happy to have you so first of all what</text><text start="31.47" dur="5.519">is this collective of neuro hackers you</text><text start="33.629" dur="6.57">are assembling it sounds like a you know</text><text start="36.989" dur="4.971">sort of pie-in-the-sky big project where</text><text start="40.199" dur="5.221">you&apos;re hit you&apos;re aiming for a lot of</text><text start="41.96" dur="5.23">world-changing goals but can you unpack</text><text start="45.42" dur="4.5">a little bit for us what your your</text><text start="47.19" dur="4.59">approach here yeah so by neuro hacking</text><text start="49.92" dur="4.409">we mean anything that can optimize the</text><text start="51.78" dur="4.829">mind brain interface and the function</text><text start="54.329" dur="4.651">thereof so this is cognitive and</text><text start="56.609" dur="5.671">psychomotor and health and well-being</text><text start="58.98" dur="5.639">and so we could roughly define it as</text><text start="62.28" dur="3.659">well-being optimization but even larger</text><text start="64.619" dur="4.11">than that we think of it as sovereignty</text><text start="65.939" dur="4.71">optimization people&apos;s capacity to make</text><text start="68.729" dur="4.741">good choices right to be adaptive which</text><text start="70.649" dur="5.01">is a function of intelligence of agency</text><text start="73.47" dur="5.249">of sentient soul together and there&apos;s</text><text start="75.659" dur="4.831">obviously a kind of human software right</text><text start="78.719" dur="3.9">psychology here and there&apos;s human</text><text start="80.49" dur="3.72">Hardware physiology involved and we know</text><text start="82.619" dur="4.191">that&apos;s a software hardware divide in</text><text start="84.21" dur="4.619">humans is a plastic one it&apos;s</text><text start="86.81" dur="5.05">continuously inter affecting each other</text><text start="88.829" dur="6.451">and so you know your work with</text><text start="91.86" dur="4.53">neurofeedback is neuro hacking the other</text><text start="95.28" dur="3.18">people you&apos;ve had on the show to</text><text start="96.39" dur="4.92">discussing meditation etc is all in that</text><text start="98.46" dur="5.28">space so we&apos;re interested in all</text><text start="101.31" dur="7.89">categories of technologies that can</text><text start="103.74" dur="8.22">meaningfully increase the homeostatic</text><text start="109.2" dur="4.949">capacity the dynamics as you like to</text><text start="111.96" dur="4.71">call them yeah of the human neuro</text><text start="114.149" dur="5.58">regulatory system and thereby increase</text><text start="116.67" dur="5.489">people&apos;s capacity for complex thinking</text><text start="119.729" dur="5.341">emotional resilience etc and the reason</text><text start="122.159" dur="4.441">why collective is anyone that is doing</text><text start="125.07" dur="3.66">meaningful work here we want to figure</text><text start="126.6" dur="4.11">out how we can participate at a research</text><text start="128.73" dur="4.74">level and at a you know information</text><text start="130.71" dur="5.07">product level etc so like us</text><text start="133.47" dur="4.98">walking here together is is awesome</text><text start="135.78" dur="5.22">shape koshering information in the space</text><text start="138.45" dur="5.36">that&apos;s great so you say sovereignty it&apos;s</text><text start="141.0" dur="6.27">an interesting way to way to frame that</text><text start="143.81" dur="6.13">agency what do you mean by I mean what</text><text start="147.27" dur="7.7">what kinds of things are bottlenecks to</text><text start="149.94" dur="8.58">human agency that appear to be a mere</text><text start="154.97" dur="6.01">affected by things we can do to the</text><text start="158.52" dur="4.26">brain like what how can we affect agency</text><text start="160.98" dur="4.8">in tractable ways what are you saying</text><text start="162.78" dur="6.21">what are you exploring yeah so by agency</text><text start="165.78" dur="5.07">here we mean the the actuator capacity</text><text start="168.99" dur="4.8">of a complex system the ability to act</text><text start="170.85" dur="4.95">on and in the world okay send chance is</text><text start="173.79" dur="4.74">kind of roughly related to our scent our</text><text start="175.8" dur="4.23">sensory input capacity intelligence to</text><text start="178.53" dur="3.45">our information processing of that</text><text start="180.03" dur="4.35">sensory input so that those exist in a</text><text start="181.98" dur="4.17">closed-loop take in information about</text><text start="184.38" dur="4.92">the world which is internal and external</text><text start="186.15" dur="4.95">sensing process it to inform choice make</text><text start="189.3" dur="5.52">choice get that about that choice</text><text start="191.1" dur="6.859">recursively upregulate and so on the</text><text start="194.82" dur="6.419">agency side on the capacity to act</text><text start="197.959" dur="4.961">obviously that requires the capacity to</text><text start="201.239" dur="3.301">have good information and information</text><text start="202.92" dur="3.15">processing so there&apos;s good choice in</text><text start="204.54" dur="3.87">forming it right it also requires</text><text start="206.07" dur="4.05">impulse control yeah yeah one can</text><text start="208.41" dur="3.54">actually have executive function and all</text><text start="210.12" dur="6.21">that they now come to bear it also</text><text start="211.95" dur="6.45">requires the it on the you know kind of</text><text start="216.33" dur="4.68">choice making side of it requires the</text><text start="218.4" dur="4.589">capacity to think through things using</text><text start="221.01" dur="3.87">different frameworks right critical</text><text start="222.989" dur="4.921">thinking frameworks systemic thinking</text><text start="224.88" dur="6.57">frameworks lateral thinking etc but also</text><text start="227.91" dur="5.28">in the agency side emotional resilience</text><text start="231.45" dur="3.21">is a key factor so that as one is</text><text start="233.19" dur="3.35">working with things and difficulties</text><text start="234.66" dur="3.96">come they can process that</text><text start="236.54" dur="3.82">physiologically and psychologically in</text><text start="238.62" dur="3.81">ways that empower them to continue to</text><text start="240.36" dur="3.72">learn rather than get shut down and so</text><text start="242.43" dur="5.55">when we look at the physiology of that</text><text start="244.08" dur="6.0">we know a lot about how dopamine about</text><text start="247.98" dur="3.569">how adrenal hormones about how you know</text><text start="250.08" dur="3.57">many different aspects of neural</text><text start="251.549" dur="5.341">chemistry and physiology are involved in</text><text start="253.65" dur="5.45">one sense of drive one sense of reward</text><text start="256.89" dur="4.02">dynamics that can predispose</text><text start="259.1" dur="4.48">dysfunctional or more functional</text><text start="260.91" dur="4.59">patterns of human behavior increased</text><text start="263.58" dur="3.48">sense of capacity psychologically</text><text start="265.5" dur="3.389">physiologically etc</text><text start="267.06" dur="3.48">so again we&apos;re back to this somewhat</text><text start="268.889" dur="4.651">soft division between the software and</text><text start="270.54" dur="4.86">the hardware so on the hardware side</text><text start="273.54" dur="3.15">things as you said like impulsivity or</text><text start="275.4" dur="2.82">executive function</text><text start="276.69" dur="4.59">I think you&apos;e Bleakley referred to</text><text start="278.22" dur="5.4">working memory essentially which is from</text><text start="281.28" dur="4.68">my perspective the biggest bottleneck in</text><text start="283.62" dur="7.83">human performance and one that appears</text><text start="285.96" dur="7.74">to be the least responsive to change but</text><text start="291.45" dur="4.91">also ways of thinking about emotional</text><text start="293.7" dur="5.1">regulation and decision-making criteria</text><text start="296.36" dur="4.54">I&apos;m much more familiar with the</text><text start="298.8" dur="4.68">physiology side you know the biohacking</text><text start="300.9" dur="5.91">idea is on the brain not the mind</text><text start="303.48" dur="4.97">largely what are you seeing of some</text><text start="306.81" dur="7.95">interesting ways that we can get into</text><text start="308.45" dur="9.07">cognitive change so the core</text><text start="314.76" dur="5.21">psychological brain mind question right</text><text start="317.52" dur="4.59">is at the core of the philosophy of</text><text start="319.97" dur="3.34">neuroscience the philosophy of line the</text><text start="322.11" dur="3.15">philosophy of science itself right</text><text start="323.31" dur="3.84">because the brain mind gets into the</text><text start="325.26" dur="3.51">brain physics and the question of what</text><text start="327.15" dur="3.329">is consciousness what is physics how do</text><text start="328.77" dur="4.32">they interact is there bi-directional</text><text start="330.479" dur="3.871">causation beyond the scope of what we&apos;re</text><text start="333.09" dur="2.7">probably going to dive into here but</text><text start="334.35" dur="4.94">it&apos;s definitely at the core of what&apos;s</text><text start="335.79" dur="3.5">informing the whatever you do okay so</text><text start="341.3" dur="5.38">how in any model of philosophy of mind</text><text start="344.7" dur="3.69">however we address this it&apos;s clear that</text><text start="346.68" dur="4.08">what&apos;s happening physiologically is</text><text start="348.39" dur="3.93">affecting one subjective experience and</text><text start="350.76" dur="4.35">what&apos;s happening one subjective</text><text start="352.32" dur="6.93">experience is being mirrored on you know</text><text start="355.11" dur="7.559">affecting the physiology side and so we</text><text start="359.25" dur="5.91">can obviously modify brain chemistry the</text><text start="362.669" dur="4.261">whole field of Psychiatry is focused on</text><text start="365.16" dur="3.87">this right second row pharmacology and</text><text start="366.93" dur="4.739">not just pharmacology but neuro tech in</text><text start="369.03" dur="5.07">general sure sure to affect cognitive</text><text start="371.669" dur="8.191">and psychological predispositions and</text><text start="374.1" dur="8.4">capacities we can also do practices that</text><text start="379.86" dur="4.47">are involving one&apos;s direction of their</text><text start="382.5" dur="2.789">own attention and subjective experience</text><text start="384.33" dur="3.33">whether we&apos;re talking about cognitive</text><text start="385.289" dur="5.011">behavioral therapy CBT DBT other</text><text start="387.66" dur="3.629">psychotherapeutic processes or even what</text><text start="390.3" dur="3.78">we call more kind of mindfulness</text><text start="391.289" dur="5.011">processes of proprioception pay</text><text start="394.08" dur="3.78">attention to various sensations in the</text><text start="396.3" dur="3.299">body parts of the body and what&apos;s the</text><text start="397.86" dur="2.53">changes as I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve done a lot of</text><text start="399.599" dur="4.701">on</text><text start="400.39" dur="7.21">physiology EEG processes and then what&apos;s</text><text start="404.3" dur="5.13">the capacity for neuroplastic changes in</text><text start="407.6" dur="5.7">the connectome with enough time and</text><text start="409.43" dur="5.4">input in there so it&apos;s not only that the</text><text start="413.3" dur="5.64">division between hardware and software</text><text start="414.83" dur="5.88">is soft it&apos;s they are both Co evolving</text><text start="418.94" dur="3.45">all the time and interdependent and</text><text start="420.71" dur="3.57">changing each others you alluded to yeah</text><text start="422.39" dur="3.33">yeah I mean I have to say I&apos;m a I&apos;m a</text><text start="424.28" dur="5.79">reductionist in this space a little bit</text><text start="425.72" dur="5.94">so for me the mind is simply the part of</text><text start="430.07" dur="4.53">the brain that we are aware of and</text><text start="431.66" dur="5.19">experiencing and and I kind of don&apos;t go</text><text start="434.6" dur="3.3">below that I have a somewhat of a</text><text start="436.85" dur="3.72">Buddhist perspective where I don&apos;t</text><text start="437.9" dur="3.75">really believe in consciousness</text><text start="440.57" dur="4.8">I believe in moments of consciousness</text><text start="441.65" dur="5.67">but not the overarching I like if the</text><text start="445.37" dur="3.81">brain falls over from my perspective</text><text start="447.32" dur="4.82">that&apos;s it there&apos;s there&apos;s there is no</text><text start="449.18" dur="5.37">mind outside of the the coupe Oriole</text><text start="452.14" dur="4.12">boundary of the skull so to speak even</text><text start="454.55" dur="2.94">though I know that there are non-local</text><text start="456.26" dur="3.18">phenomenon that we&apos;re observing now in</text><text start="457.49" dur="3.75">the brain and I&apos;m sure you are deeper</text><text start="459.44" dur="4.68">into this idea of begin the physics</text><text start="461.24" dur="7.02">affecting consciousness I&apos;ve just saw a</text><text start="464.12" dur="7.23">saw paper last week that showed that</text><text start="468.26" dur="7.53">water has some strange kind of non-local</text><text start="471.35" dur="6.99">I hate to use word but quantum tunneling</text><text start="475.79" dur="4.59">in microtubules apparently under some</text><text start="478.34" dur="5.28">conditions it appears like water</text><text start="480.38" dur="5.64">molecules have a superposition and can</text><text start="483.62" dur="8.76">be in more than one place at once inside</text><text start="486.02" dur="8.04">of cells this is getting very quickly</text><text start="492.38" dur="4.62">out of the realm of anything we fully</text><text start="494.06" dur="4.44">understand but do you think that we are</text><text start="497.0" dur="3.479">getting to a place where we&apos;re starting</text><text start="498.5" dur="5.13">to run up against the you know the edge</text><text start="500.479" dur="5.911">of wander said science and we&apos;re off in</text><text start="503.63" dur="5.49">the quantum you know weeds or is there</text><text start="506.39" dur="6.26">something here that we&apos;re making actual</text><text start="509.12" dur="8.16">progress in you know actionable</text><text start="512.65" dur="8.079">understanding of the brain both so</text><text start="517.28" dur="5.58">quantum mechanics brings us to the limit</text><text start="520.729" dur="4.141">of understand ability not just what we</text><text start="522.86" dur="4.53">currently understand that the upper</text><text start="524.87" dur="4.98">limits on epistemology have</text><text start="527.39" dur="4.05">measurability them yeah and even beyond</text><text start="529.85" dur="3.37">measurability the upper limits on</text><text start="531.44" dur="4.75">ontology Reitman</text><text start="533.22" dur="4.29">Heisenberg&apos;s theorem doesn&apos;t just say we</text><text start="536.19" dur="3.93">can&apos;t know what it is because of</text><text start="537.51" dur="3.84">measurement issues it says it&apos;s and it</text><text start="540.12" dur="3.87">depends on which interpretation of</text><text start="541.35" dur="5.73">quantum mechanics but standard model</text><text start="543.99" dur="5.13">interpretation its fundamental nature is</text><text start="547.08" dur="5.25">not yet defined independent of an</text><text start="549.12" dur="5.73">observation dynamic that observation the</text><text start="552.33" dur="4.14">subject object interaction Arco defining</text><text start="554.85" dur="4.59">at the level of quantum particles mhm</text><text start="556.47" dur="5.19">it&apos;s a very philosophically weird thing</text><text start="559.44" dur="4.41">for us to think about using the</text><text start="561.66" dur="5.88">intuition that we have from traditional</text><text start="563.85" dur="5.79">larger particle physics yeah now we have</text><text start="567.54" dur="3.57">historically kind of written that off as</text><text start="569.64" dur="3.93">just super weird phenomena that happens</text><text start="571.11" dur="3.96">only below atoms then cancels itself out</text><text start="573.57" dur="3.51">at the level of atoms and so we don&apos;t</text><text start="575.07" dur="3.93">have to worry about it the topic of</text><text start="577.08" dur="3.66">quantum amplification are there quantum</text><text start="579.0" dur="4.02">phenomena that then affect the behavior</text><text start="580.74" dur="4.59">of things at a mesoscopic level at a</text><text start="583.02" dur="4.53">Newtonian physics level or right uh-huh</text><text start="585.33" dur="4.02">so this is you know the work of Stewart</text><text start="587.55" dur="3.57">Kaufman the work of other people at</text><text start="589.35" dur="3.21">Santa Fe Institute of complexity science</text><text start="591.12" dur="6.72">the work of people like Stuart Hameroff</text><text start="592.56" dur="7.05">have really shown quite clearly the</text><text start="597.84" dur="5.04">quantum amplification does happen which</text><text start="599.61" dur="5.22">means that the non-deterministic right a</text><text start="602.88" dur="3.78">causal phenomena at a quantum level are</text><text start="604.83" dur="4.19">affecting macroscopic behavior at the</text><text start="606.66" dur="4.94">level of brains that still follows</text><text start="609.02" dur="6.1">probability distributions but not</text><text start="611.6" dur="5.44">determinism and I so this is this is a</text><text start="615.12" dur="3.03">very interesting very important weird</text><text start="617.04" dur="3.57">topic and the whole topic of</text><text start="618.15" dur="6.21">microtubules microtubules in neurons and</text><text start="620.61" dur="5.61">specific and superposition dynamics and</text><text start="624.36" dur="3.27">quantum information processing is one of</text><text start="626.22" dur="5.22">the like kind of interesting cutting</text><text start="627.63" dur="5.82">edges in the field the work of Stuart</text><text start="631.44" dur="6.84">Hameroff and Roger Penrose kind of open</text><text start="633.45" dur="6.45">that space up and the work of dr. honor</text><text start="638.28" dur="4.08">bond there&apos;s a few people kind of</text><text start="639.9" dur="4.65">working in that space and it is only</text><text start="642.36" dur="4.46">scratching at the surface of what we can</text><text start="644.55" dur="4.17">claim to know well but there&apos;s already</text><text start="646.82" dur="3.67">application happening and things like</text><text start="648.72" dur="3.75">transcranial ultrasound that were based</text><text start="650.49" dur="3.78">on the philosophy from there that seemed</text><text start="652.47" dur="3.57">to be having positive result so it&apos;s a</text><text start="654.27" dur="2.82">super interesting field interesting</text><text start="656.04" dur="2.4">that&apos;s oh it&apos;s wonderful thanks for</text><text start="657.09" dur="2.61">unpacking that just a touch for us I</text><text start="658.44" dur="3.8">would say one more thing about that yeah</text><text start="659.7" dur="6.21">the Buddhist perspective the kind of</text><text start="662.24" dur="5.22">John Cyril idea of that the mind is what</text><text start="665.91" dur="3.32">the brain does</text><text start="667.46" dur="5.5">[Music]</text><text start="669.23" dur="5.5">this is one interpretation of Buddhism</text><text start="672.96" dur="2.73">right there different schools as yours</text><text start="674.73" dur="5.6">I&apos;m sure have very different</text><text start="675.69" dur="7.62">interpretations here obviously the</text><text start="680.33" dur="7.05">foundational idea of what&apos;s

dur="5.37">idea that it&apos;s non self or the idea that</text><text start="836.04" dur="4.11">it&apos;s self are inadequate so what we</text><text start="838.26" dur="4.65">think of as self is self

my</text><text start="951.569" dur="3.931">pistol my logic tools when we do science</text><text start="953.16" dur="4.83">we are studying third-person things</text><text start="955.5" dur="3.6">that&apos;s very sure do so when we try and</text><text start="957.99" dur="2.67">study consciousness which is</text><text start="959.1" dur="3.989">first-person by looking at the</text><text start="960.66" dur="5.19">third-person core correlates we&apos;re</text><text start="963.089" dur="4.021">actually doing a category mistake mmm by</text><text start="965.85"

dur="3.631">are fascinating and tricky areas what we</text><text start="980.069" dur="5.58">can say at the level of what&apos;s probably</text><text start="981.66" dur="7.169">useful for people right now is that we</text><text start="985.649" dur="6.3">can do things with our own subjective</text><text start="988.829" dur="5.731">experience of self so what we focus on</text><text start="991.949" dur="5.49">we put our attention and the meaning we</text><text start="994.56" dur="5.19">give to things that has a real effect on</text><text start="997.439" dur="3.871">brain and physiology and we

dur="5.831">more adaptive evolutionary directions or</text><text start="1018.41" dur="6.629">vicious cycles and so learning how to</text><text start="1021.35" dur="5.699">use both the conscious

stuff no pun intended till you</text><text start="1034.76" dur="4.409">taste like a philosophy a guy he read</text><text start="1037.85" dur="4.17">you have a philosophy background yeah</text><text start="1039.169" dur="7.591">yeah tell us about that what is your</text><text start="1042.02" dur="6.51">when he&apos;s returning been there uh so I</text><text start="1046.76" dur="3.69">was home-schooled growing out okay and</text><text start="1048.53" dur="3.779">all the sciences and all the philosophic</text><text start="1050.45" dur="4.53">traditions were what I was fascinated by</text><text start="1052.309" dur="4.201">and so a particular home school didn&apos;t</text><text start="1054.98" dur="3.05">have curriculum so I just got to study</text><text start="1056.51" dur="3.659">what I wanted to know was</text><text start="1058.03" dur="4.66">interdisciplinary science system science</text><text start="1060.169" dur="5.49">and the various philosophic traditions</text><text start="1062.69" dur="3.969">because the the impulse to study science</text><text start="1065.659" dur="3.13">was impulse to</text><text start="1066.659" dur="3.99">understand the nature of reality we live</text><text start="1068.789" dur="5.151">in sure better yeah which is a</text><text start="1070.649" dur="6.96">philosophic impulse right science is a</text><text start="1073.94" dur="5.709">method of knowing that correlates to a</text><text start="1077.609" dur="4.29">particular philosophic system right</text><text start="1079.649" dur="4.47">philosophical

start="1086.789" dur="3.661">real we can measure it get the same</text><text start="1088.139" dur="3.811">results so science is a subset of</text><text start="1090.45" dur="3.929">philosophy it&apos;s

of</text><text start="1626.44" dur="4.439">systems modeling to understanding that</text><text start="1628.659" dur="3.84">better and it is what in computer</text><text start="1630.879"

start="1678.009" dur="3.931">right that&apos;s the modeling part I think</text><text start="1680.529" dur="3.09">the modeling part is key and that&apos;s it</text><text start="1681.94" dur="5.699">neuro hoc are what we&apos;re really focused</text><text start="1683.619" dur="6.15">on is taking models like cybernetics</text><text start="1687.639" dur="5.28">right like complex

and getting to the</text><text start="1701.2" dur="3.209">place where we can start to aggregate</text><text start="1702.549" dur="5.46">tremendous amounts of data there and</text><text

start="1737.559" dur="7.881">homeostasis sure life is not stasis we</text><text start="1741.519" dur="6.451">have these homeo dynamic yeah and then</text><text start="1745.44" dur="4.689">thriving health has to do with the homeo</text><text start="1747.97" dur="4.47">dynamic capacity and resilience across</text><text start="1750.129" dur="5.491">all of those homeo dynamic axes right</text><text start="1752.44" dur="5.699">mm-hmm aging is decreased homeo dynamic</text><text start="1755.62" dur="5.039">capacity across some of the axes does</text><text start="1758.139" dur="7.17">that mean decreased range of variability</text><text start="1760.659" dur="7.051">in actually decreased capacity to have a</text><text start="1765.309" dur="4.11">stressor right some things that&apos;s

dur="6.059">dynamic range so then if which means</text><text start="1776.049" dur="4.62">less resilience so to be concrete things</text><text start="1778.149" dur="4.041">like insulin or cortisol rotla to</text><text start="1780.669" dur="4.71">insulin rises when you consume sugar</text><text start="1782.19" dur="5.469">right when you know it&apos;s a signaling</text><text start="1785.379" dur="5.331">molecule cells suck up the glucose</text><text start="1787.659" dur="5.25">insulin goes back down to chronically</text><text start="1790.71" dur="3.76">pretty sure the insulin system to the</text><text start="1792.909" dur="4.201">top of its range eventually it stops</text><text start="1794.47" dur="5.159">varying and we call that type 2 diabetes</text><text start="1797.11" dur="4.62">and on the way there the kind of</text><text start="1799.629" dur="3.66">syndrome X dynamics where fasting</text><text start="1801.73" dur="3.75">insulin levels raise you get insulin</text><text start="1803.289" dur="3.541">resistance at the level cells now you</text><text start="1805.48" dur="2.699">take sugar and in your blood sugar is</text><text start="1806.83"

start="1811.539" dur="5.21">affected by blood sugar so more than</text><text start="1813.159" dur="6.031">pathophysiology so we&apos;re defining here</text><text start="1816.749" dur="5.8">aging is not disease because disease</text><text start="1819.19" dur="6.349">we&apos;d actually say is the deviation from</text><text start="1822.549" dur="5.76">homeostatic range or homeo dynamic range</text><text start="1825.539" dur="5.161">where some metric actually goes out of</text><text start="1828.309" dur="4.86">effective range and then you get a</text><text start="1830.7" dur="4.809">pathophysiologic cascade okay</text><text start="1833.169" dur="3.931">so aging is not that it&apos;s the increased</text><text start="1835.509" dur="3.03">susceptibility for that so it&apos;s</text><text start="1837.1" dur="3.86">increased susceptibility for disease</text><text start="1838.539" dur="5.34">because someone could have all of their</text><text start="1840.96" dur="5.559">markers within homeostatic state range</text><text start="1843.879" dur="4.561">mm-hmm but more sensitive to them being</text><text start="1846.519" dur="4.11">able to go out of range from whatever</text><text start="1848.44" dur="4.109">stresses so they&apos;re less label to sit in</text><text start="1850.629" dur="4.53">the in the in the healthy basin of the</text><text start="1852.549" dur="5.01">phase space so to speak right okay sorry</text><text start="1855.159" dur="5.931">and so what we&apos;re interested in here is</text><text start="1857.559" dur="5.791">how do we where someone already has</text><text start="1861.09" dur="4.66">disease dynamics going on how do we</text><text start="1863.35" dur="4.319">identify specifically what caused</text><text start="1865.75" dur="2.75">deviation from homeostasis on which</text><text start="1867.669" dur="2.961">dynamics</text><text start="1868.5" dur="3.54">what was the causal cascade that</text><text start="1870.63" dur="3.27">happened and how do we specifically</text><text start="1872.04" dur="5.34">reverse it like we mentioned with the</text><text start="1873.9" dur="5.31">anxiety are we are we keel ating</text><text start="1877.38" dur="3.39">neurotoxins or are we fixing the gut</text><text start="1879.21" dur="3.66">brain access or those are very different</text><text start="1880.77" dur="4.38">things that require specific addressing</text><text start="1882.87" dur="4.47">of what the causal cascade was so this</text><text start="1885.15" dur="5.43">is not let&apos;s say going to insulin the</text><text start="1887.34" dur="5.22">insulin insensitivity that cells</text><text start="1890.58" dur="4.26">experience after high levels of insulin</text><text start="1892.56" dur="5.45">that&apos;s not the disease itself that is</text><text start="1894.84" dur="5.43">the failure of the dynamic range correct</text><text start="1898.01" dur="4.57">and we call these diseases things like</text><text start="1900.27" dur="5.13">diabetes and Alzheimer&apos;s or other things</text><text start="1902.58" dur="4.77">because of the failure now there are</text><text start="1905.4" dur="4.02">some people who get type 2 diabetes who</text><text start="1907.35" dur="3.69">did not consume too much carbohydrates</text><text start="1909.42" dur="3.75">relative to what they burn but they are</text><text start="1911.04" dur="4.35">deficient in chromium or vanadium that</text><text start="1913.17" dur="4.98">are nary to actually have insulin</text><text start="1915.39" dur="4.35">process that receptors so there are</text><text start="1918.15" dur="3.03">other dynamics that can go on which is</text><text start="1919.74" dur="4.08">why we actually have to understand what</text><text start="1921.18" dur="4.44">are what is the entire causal phase</text><text start="1923.82" dur="3.54">space of what can cause an imbalance all</text><text start="1925.62" dur="4.08">the things that could be involved and</text><text start="1927.36" dur="5.37">this is what we&apos;ve sucked at at medicine</text><text start="1929.7" dur="4.95">so far is dealing with complex causation</text><text start="1932.73" dur="3.93">yeah feud causation straightforward</text><text start="1934.65" dur="5.46">right so injury pretty straightforward</text><text start="1936.66" dur="6.42">and so we&apos;re going to be able to address</text><text start="1940.11" dur="4.59">that in a clearer way but where the</text><text start="1943.08" dur="3.6">causation is either delayed in

like redox signaling</text><text start="2240.859" dur="5.01">decreasing inefficiency in cells yes</text><text start="2243.499" dur="5.01">yeah so this is why all the nicotinamide</text><text start="2245.869" dur="5.581">right aside stuff has been so if you can</text><text start="2248.509" dur="4.56">up regulate the NAD+ NADH ratio there&apos;s</text><text start="2251.45" dur="4.079">a lot of cool things that happen yeah do</text><text start="2253.069" dur="6.18">we see a CP decreasing inside of cells</text><text start="2255.529" dur="6.03">yes do all the things that cells do need</text><text start="2259.249" dur="5.85">those chemicals sure yeah if we can</text><text start="2261.559" dur="5.641">support mitochondrial biogenesis if we</text><text start="2265.099" dur="4.321">can support ATP production efficiency</text><text start="2267.2" dur="5.97">and krebs cycle upregulation yep if we</text><text start="2269.42" dur="5.31">support protection of the

dur="3.301">is that going to do what is going to</text><text start="2278.63" dur="3.929">help the complex dynamics of everything</text><text start="2280.91" dur="3.87">the cells are doing happened better and</text><text start="2282.559" dur="4.921">so I think those are one of the key</text><text start="2284.78" dur="5.61">things we so you know we were saying</text><text start="2287.48" dur="5.4">earlier there are specific sources of</text><text start="2290.39" dur="4.28">pathology right causes of deviation from</text><text start="2292.88" dur="3.81">homeostasis that we want to identify</text><text start="2294.67" dur="4.659">specifically in Reverse you have the</text><text start="2296.69" dur="5.52">Jin&apos;s toxins deficiencies etc then there</text><text start="2299.329" dur="4.561">are general system dynamics that support</text><text start="2302.21" dur="4.859">system resilience and we want to support</text><text start="2303.89" dur="4.89">those even though the

dur="3.661">regulation is going to produce you know</text><text start="2314.059" dur="4.381">how much is it going to affect a</text><text start="2315.23" dur="4.56">particular gastrointestinal dynamic well</text><text start="2318.44" dur="3.06">it depends on what all the causal</text><text start="2319.79" dur="3.42">dynamic oh yeah it should move it in the</text><text start="2321.5" dur="2.94">right direction to the degree that it&apos;s</text><text start="2323.21" dur="3.45">creating better sympathetic</text><text start="2324.44" dur="4.8">parasympathetic you know ratio dynamics</text><text start="2326.66" dur="6.27">etc yeah so we want to in general</text><text start="2329.24" dur="5.819">support the homeostatic processes that</text><text start="2332.93" dur="4.5">are fundamental and get better at</text><text start="2335.059" dur="3.961">diagnosing individual sources of</text><text start="2337.43" dur="2.97">pathology and reversing them this is</text><text start="2339.02" dur="3.15">great I mean this actually ties into how</text><text start="2340.4" dur="2.939">I often frame there a feedback for</text><text start="2342.17" dur="3.75">people and they say oh how to do this</text><text start="2343.339" dur="4.921">and I&apos;ll say well we&apos;re probably going</text><text start="2345.92" dur="4.53">to give you more resources and all the</text><text start="2348.26" dur="3.75">regulatory domains of sleep stress and</text><text start="2350.45" dur="3.659">attention and what that means is</text><text start="2352.01" dur="5.16">resilience right and we can probably</text><text start="2354.109" dur="4.321">reach in and do more specific things for</text><text start="2357.17" dur="2.909">you but let&apos;s see what happens first</text><text start="2358.43" dur="3.419">when we bring the resilience way up and</text><text start="2360.079" dur="3.901">get you sleeping like a rocket will and</text><text start="2361.849" dur="3.841">being creative and flexible let&apos;s do</text><text start="2363.98" dur="3.0">that for the first few weeks and then we</text><text start="2365.69" dur="3.659">can go in and try to target the thing</text><text start="2366.98" dur="3.72">you think you care about me and usually</text><text start="2369.349" dur="3.27">the thing that they really want to work</text><text start="2370.7" dur="3.99">on sorts itself out along the way</text><text start="2372.619" dur="4.321">towards just building everything that</text><text start="2374.69" dur="6.09">the complexity of the interconnectedness</text><text start="2376.94" dur="6.51">of everything is again why specialties</text><text start="2380.78" dur="5.16">have failed at complex illnesses yeah</text><text start="2383.45" dur="5.399">but it&apos;s also so fascinating because you</text><text start="2385.94" dur="5.01">know we can look at a structural issue</text><text start="2388.849" dur="4.2">right like a postural issue or</text><text start="2390.95" dur="4.5">osteoarthritis that&apos;s causing can</text><text start="2393.049" dur="4.29">continues inflammation within the</text><text

dur="3.9">is causing sympathetic feedback into the</text><text start="2407.9" dur="3.03">brain which then is going to cause</text><text start="2409.34" dur="3.42">effects on all the things the brain is</text><text start="2410.93" dur="3.9">regulating for helps on perspective life</text><text start="2412.76" dur="6.51">and what needed fixed was a structural</text><text start="2414.83"

dur="8.01">so can can structural issues and joints</text><text start="2434.96" dur="5.49">or psychological patterns of focus and</text><text start="2438.56" dur="3.75">meaning making or things going on in the</text><text start="2440.45" dur="3.96">gut or affect any other system in the</text><text start="2442.31" dur="4.29">body yes this is what&apos;s fascinating is</text><text start="2444.41" dur="4.83">why trying to separate neurology and</text><text start="2446.6" dur="4.62">gastroenterology and oncology has a pile</text><text start="2449.24" dur="3.66">here yeah and so now it&apos;s how do we</text><text start="2451.22" dur="3.42">synthesize what we understand about the</text><text start="2452.9" dur="3.33">parts to understand what happens for</text><text start="2454.64" dur="3.42">whole systems and what happens across</text><text start="2456.23" dur="4.14">systems so now you&apos;re doing this at the</text><text start="2458.06" dur="4.2">Niraj collective this idea of

start="2486.56" dur="4.14">things we can actually do this a product</text><text start="2488.0" dur="4.41">you&apos;ve produced called qualia which is</text><text start="2490.7" dur="4.68">Ana tropics is that is it an entropic</text><text start="2492.41" dur="5.34">space okay do you consider it in tropic</text><text start="2495.38" dur="3.99">or is it more than that is that a good</text><text start="2497.75" dur="3.69">frame for it is that too limiting I</text><text start="2499.37" dur="3.69">think that&apos;s a fine frame as you know</text><text start="2501.44" dur="3.09">the term no

dur="4.48">well I would I would in general start by</text><text start="2509.9" dur="4.32">making the distinctions between brain</text><text start="2511.46" dur="5.34">nutrient no tropic and smart drug which</text><text start="2514.22" dur="3.9">are apparently used kind of in relation</text><text start="2516.8" dur="4.11">to each other yeah it&apos;s worth</text><text start="2518.12" dur="4.65">distinguishing so brain nutrient means</text><text start="2520.91" dur="3.72">something that you&apos;d normally get from a</text><text start="2522.77" dur="3.6">dietary source that&apos;s

dur="3.151">least knowing that quite clearly for</text><text start="2782.7" dur="2.879">many of them it was worth it because</text><text start="2783.69" dur="3.359">that&apos;s what they want to do

happen</text><text start="2815.609" dur="3.721">in formal ressure sure so it&apos;s a very</text><text start="2817.77" dur="3.089">interesting topic right it is a place</text><text start="2819.33" dur="3.75">where citizen science is always going to</text><text start="2820.859" dur="5.461">be advancing the front edge and I would</text><text start="2823.08" dur="4.59">say all of the Psychonauts working with</text><text start="2826.32" dur="4.32">deep psychedelics are in the same place</text><text start="2827.67" dur="5.189">and so one of the things we really like</text><text start="2830.64" dur="3.69">is for people who are for whatever</text><text start="2832.859" dur="2.971">reason inclined to do their own research</text><text start="2834.33" dur="3.3">give them better quantified self tools</text><text start="2835.83" dur="3.3">and learn from that if it&apos;s outside of</text><text start="2837.63" dur="3.75">what we can do formal research on and</text><text start="2839.13" dur="3.75">then you know be able to take the formal</text><text start="2841.38" dur="3.66">research from the crowdsource to get a</text><text start="2842.88" dur="4.07">very big level essentially that&apos;s great</text><text start="2845.04" dur="8.88">now with regard to what the appropriate</text><text start="2846.95" dur="8.53">risk benefit dynamics are yeah so you</text><text start="2853.92" dur="3.9">mentioned modafinil and take it further</text><text start="2855.48" dur="4.35">methamphetamine definitely increases</text><text start="2857.82" dur="4.65">certain cognitive capacities and it</text><text start="2859.83" dur="7.14">kills the flu virus it has a number of</text><text start="2862.47" dur="8.96">positive medical credentials yeah and it</text><text start="2866.97" dur="7.23">has very real side effects and so if</text><text start="2871.43" dur="3.909">someone is in a combat situation and</text><text start="2874.2" dur="1.59">then you have stay awake a little bit</text><text start="2875.339" dur="2.191">longer</text><text start="2875.79" dur="3.87">they have meth might make sense right</text><text start="2877.53" dur="5.88">part of how those drugs were developed</text><text start="2879.66" dur="7.439">yeah for general use for your midterms</text><text start="2883.41" dur="6.83">you know it&apos;s not a good idea now if we</text><text start="2887.099" dur="5.671">look at how much off-label adderall and</text><text start="2890.24" dur="5.08">modafinil and redbull and whatever right</text><text start="2892.77" dur="3.87">you know happens for those purposes this</text><text start="2895.32" dur="6.9">was one of the main reasons we decided</text><text start="2896.64" dur="8.07">to make quality was not only are the</text><text start="2902.22" dur="4.139">down regulation and side effects pretty</text><text start="2904.71" dur="3.72">significant of most of those but even</text><text start="2906.359" dur="4.881">the positives are fairly narrow mm-hmm</text><text start="2908.43" dur="5.31">right so if you have if you use it a</text><text start="2911.24" dur="4.48">presynaptic dopamine agonist right like</text><text start="2913.74" dur="3.69">adderall you will get increased focus</text><text start="2915.72" dur="3.51">but you might actually get</text><text start="2917.43" dur="3.929">simultaneously decreased working memory</text><text start="2919.23" dur="5.43">we would have seen on that is clear</text><text start="2921.359" dur="5.01">which is not the kind of total</text><text start="2924.66" dur="4.939">intelligence that we&apos;re interested in it</text><text start="2926.369" dur="5.041">as well as you know anxiety irritability</text><text start="2929.599" dur="3.971">depersonalization all those other</text><text start="2931.41" dur="4.08">dynamics and then of course because it&apos;s</text><text start="2933.57" dur="3.449">an external override of an internal</text><text start="2935.49" dur="3.569">regulatory system yeah</text><text start="2937.019" dur="3.63">regulation independence you know and so</text><text start="2939.059" dur="3.03">what we&apos;re really interested in I&apos;m what</text><text start="2940.649" dur="5.13">I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve been interested in the</text><text start="2942.089" dur="6.93">in the space was can we understanding</text><text start="2945.779" dur="4.83">this system more completely and nowhere</text><text start="2949.019" dur="2.73">near total completely but more</text><text start="2950.609" dur="3.9">completely right we&apos;re not just trying</text><text start="2951.749" dur="4.95">to a single molecule intervention can we</text><text start="2954.509" dur="3.69">have a much more comprehensive set of</text><text start="2956.699" dur="4.86">positive effects rather than a narrow</text><text start="2958.199" dur="6.39">set without the negative effects in real</text><text start="2961.559" dur="4.44">time and without down regulation so that</text><text start="2964.589" dur="3.48">when someone gets off of them they&apos;re</text><text start="2965.999" dur="4.29">not

dur="1.95">they dive into a seagull calling for</text><text start="2996.419" dur="2.221">sure</text><text start="2996.719" dur="3.661">shirring and so rasa Tam&apos;s and some</text><text

dur="3.991">excitotoxins the way that it brings</text><text start="3170.9" dur="3.57">excessive glutamate outside of the</text><text start="3172.52" dur="6.329">synapse so it&apos;s a very interesting</text><text start="3174.47" dur="6.93">molecule a new pepsin quality as well</text><text start="3178.849" dur="6.48">great now there are plenty of things</text><text start="3181.4" dur="7.07">that we would have in qualia if there</text><text start="3185.329" dur="5.371">was different regulatory dynamics okay</text><text start="3188.47" dur="6.04">but you know so we&apos;re working within</text><text start="3190.7" dur="6.96">both the general well-tolerated space</text><text start="3194.51" dur="7.769">the effective space the and the legal</text><text start="3197.66" dur="6.09">space sure yeah people micro dosing LSD</text><text start="3202.279" dur="1.981">or psilocybin has a lot of neat effects</text><text start="3203.75" dur="4.08">we can</text><text start="3204.26" dur="7.2">that&apos;s that arising right um not yet not</text><text start="3207.83" dur="5.63">yet so actually that&apos;s face of the</text><text start="3211.46" dur="4.17">appropriate legal categorization of</text><text start="3213.46" dur="4.03">medicines as its base that we have</text><text start="3215.63" dur="3.75">worked in and intend to more because</text><text start="3217.49" dur="5.46">it&apos;s important so more political legal</text><text start="3219.38" dur="7.95">and regulatory not at the physiology but</text><text start="3222.95" dur="7.8">at the body politic exactly interesting</text><text start="3227.33" dur="6.0">so when you look at say two men offend</text><text start="3230.75" dur="4.65">being over-the-counter hmm as a legacy</text><text start="3233.33" dur="6.57">thing in the toxicity of it came to hair</text><text start="3235.4" dur="5.82">to pot having been illegal for and still</text><text start="3239.9" dur="3.99">illegal and so many plays for so long</text><text start="3241.22" dur="3.93">it&apos;s just nonsense right right and we</text><text start="3243.89" dur="3.54">can look at the whole history of why</text><text start="3245.15" dur="3.69">those nonsense decisions were made but</text><text start="3247.43" dur="2.25">they&apos;re not just nonsense they&apos;re really</text><text start="3248.84" dur="3.78">bad for people</text><text start="3249.68" dur="4.68">yeah because pot doesn&apos;t cause liver</text><text start="3252.62" dur="3.54">damage and acetaminophen does and it but</text><text start="3254.36" dur="3.03">it addresses the same pain dynamics of</text><text start="3256.16" dur="3.51">people using it man</text><text start="3257.39" dur="4.35">yeah but you can put a few minutes on it</text><text start="3259.67" dur="3.27">with opiates and that prevents people</text><text start="3261.74" dur="3.57">from taking all the opiates and</text><text start="3262.94" dur="4.5">overdosing in theory that&apos;s that&apos;s of</text><text start="3265.31" dur="4.38">course the title three vicodin kind of</text><text start="3267.44" dur="4.32">approach is to combine to seem innocent</text><text start="3269.69" dur="3.21">to avoid to to say hey it&apos;s going to</text><text start="3271.76" dur="3.69">kill you if you take too much don&apos;t take</text><text start="3272.9" dur="5.67">too much and so then people take too</text><text start="3275.45" dur="5.16">much and get liver damage right right so</text><text start="3278.57" dur="3.24">it&apos;s not a good idea but maybe they</text><text start="3280.61" dur="6.12">didn&apos;t that wasn&apos;t well thought out</text><text start="3281.81" dur="6.48">right so um it&apos;s been heady stuff

the topics were talking about here</text><text start="3301.82" dur="3.84">neural high kinetics neural hacker calm</text><text start="3304.04" dur="4.08">okay a good place to go check it out</text><text start="3305.66" dur="5.37">great publishing more information there</text><text start="3308.12" dur="4.77">and I want to say that the work that you</text><text start="3311.03" dur="3.84">are doing and neurofeedback and the fact</text><text start="3312.89" dur="3.78">that you&apos;re scaling it with quality</text><text start="3314.87" dur="4.32">control and with the systems that allow</text><text start="3316.67" dur="3.9">that to happen that&apos;s one of the areas</text><text start="3319.19" dur="2.67">that if you hadn&apos;t done it we would have</text><text

meaningful neuro hacks that</text><text start="3326.75" dur="6.06">has the least the least damage box</text><text start="3330.17" dur="4.71">really small downside is if done well</text><text start="3332.81" dur="5.28">right yeah yeah it&apos;s real super high</text><text start="3334.88" dur="4.59">reward possibility so I&apos;m excited too</text><text start="3338.09" dur="2.85">look at if
