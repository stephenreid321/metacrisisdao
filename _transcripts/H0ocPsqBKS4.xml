that</text><text start="7.279" dur="3.36">most people would</text><text start="8.32" dur="3.6">call a learning disability and it got in</text><text start="10.639" dur="4.241">the way of</text><text start="11.92" dur="3.839">school functioning for me and more often</text><text start="14.88" dur="4.08">than not i got</text><text start="15.759" dur="5.44">dumb tracked and basically that complete</text><text start="18.96" dur="4.479">failure of school to reach me</text><text start="21.199" dur="4.24">accidentally worked like some kind of</text><text start="23.439" dur="5.041">unschooling i would say</text><text start="25.439" dur="3.76">and so um there are maybe many paths i</text><text start="28.48" dur="3.84">don&apos;t know</text><text start="29.199" dur="3.681">but i&apos;d be curious four people who have</text><text start="32.32" dur="3.919">traveled</text><text start="32.88" dur="6.64">some road to the land of</text><text start="36.239" dur="6.081">high quality independent thought what</text><text start="39.52" dur="6.32">can they expect the experience to be</text><text start="42.32" dur="3.52">like when they arrived there</text><text start="46.879" dur="3.761">the experience of high quality</text><text start="48.719" dur="4.641">independent thought</text><text start="50.64" dur="4.399">yes if you imagine that well it would be</text><text start="53.36" dur="5.039">lovely to think independently</text><text start="55.039" dur="5.121">and to do so well and the world is going</text><text start="58.399" dur="2.881">to be a paradise if you start doing that</text><text start="60.16" dur="3.039">because of course</text><text start="61.28" dur="4.32">that&apos;s a very desirable thing to do and</text><text start="63.199" dur="4.561">people will appreciate it</text><text start="65.6" dur="4.16">you&apos;re going to be surprised that&apos;s not</text><text start="67.76" dur="4.16">necessarily what happens when you arrive</text><text start="69.76" dur="3.76">there and certain experiences show up</text><text start="71.92" dur="1.92">all over the place and without telling</text><text start="73.52" dur="1.919">you</text><text start="73.84" dur="3.68">what my experiences might have been i&apos;m</text><text start="75.439" dur="3.441">curious as to what you might have</text><text start="77.52" dur="1.76">encountered and whether or not those</text><text start="78.88" dur="2.879">things</text><text start="79.28" dur="4.96">will be similar ah yeah it&apos;s an</text><text start="81.759" dur="2.481">interesting</text><text start="84.84" dur="5.959">question</text><text start="87.36" dur="6.48">i think you will experience</text><text start="90.799" dur="4.401">most people will experience a higher</text><text start="93.84" dur="5.04">degree of uncertainty</text><text start="95.2" dur="5.52">than people that are part of any</text><text start="98.88" dur="4.4">camp that has figured most things out</text><text start="100.72" dur="4.0">and they can cognitively offload whoever</text><text start="103.28" dur="3.36">the authorities or the general group</text><text start="104.72" dur="4.96">consensus is</text><text start="106.64" dur="4.96">um and certainty is</text><text start="109.68" dur="3.439">certainly comfortable in a particular</text><text start="111.6" dur="4.159">way</text><text start="113.119" dur="4.64">and if you&apos;re really thinking well about</text><text start="115.759" dur="3.601">what is my basis for what i believe what</text><text start="117.759" dur="3.601">is the epistemic grounding what&apos;s the</text><text start="119.36" dur="2.96">basis of my confidence margin</text><text start="121.36" dur="4.079">and you really think about your</text><text start="122.32" dur="5.999">confidence basis clearly</text><text start="125.439" dur="4.32">uh as you try to find more information</text><text start="128.319" dur="4.801">to deepen the topic</text><text start="129.759" dur="5.761">the known unknowns expand faster</text><text start="133.12" dur="3.52">like at least at a second order to what</text><text start="135.52" dur="3.359">the uh</text><text start="136.64" dur="4.16">known knowns do and so you keep being</text><text start="138.879" dur="3.121">aware of more stuff that you don&apos;t know</text><text start="140.8" dur="3.68">that you know is relevant</text><text start="142.0" dur="4.879">and pertains to the situation so there&apos;s</text><text start="144.48" dur="4.16">a complexification of thought</text><text start="146.879" dur="3.521">there&apos;s an increase in uncertainty</text><text start="148.64" dur="3.12">hopefully there&apos;s an emotional</text><text start="150.4" dur="2.8">development</text><text start="151.76" dur="2.88">and kind of a psychological development</text><text start="153.2" dur="3.119">where there&apos;s an increased comfort with</text><text start="154.64" dur="2.56">uncertainty so that you can actually be</text><text start="156.319" dur="4.401">honest</text><text start="157.2" dur="5.28">and not uh defect on your own sense</text><text start="160.72" dur="4.239">making into premature certainty that</text><text start="162.48" dur="5.039">creates confirmation bias</text><text start="164.959" dur="3.041">and there&apos;s also a and i think that&apos;s</text><text start="167.519" dur="1.681">why you</text><text start="168.0" dur="4.72">one of the reasons you use the term</text><text start="169.2" dur="3.52">independent um</text><text start="173.28" dur="3.36">there is a certain aloneness of not</text><text start="176.08" dur="2.239">having</text><text start="176.64" dur="3.44">a whole camp of people that think very</text><text start="178.319" dur="4.081">similarly</text><text start="180.08" dur="2.32">um</text><text start="183.2" dur="4.399">i don&apos;t find that to be a painful thing</text><text start="186.0" dur="4.64">right</text><text start="187.599" dur="4.0">but it&apos;s a thing no it&apos;s actually in its</text><text start="190.64" dur="4.16">own way</text><text start="191.599" dur="6.401">uh it&apos;s freeing because</text><text start="194.8" dur="6.32">the fact is if you follow</text><text start="198.0" dur="4.8">logic to natural conclusions</text><text start="201.12" dur="3.6">you&apos;ll end up saying a lot of things</text><text start="202.8" dur="4.88">that</text><text start="204.72" dur="4.799">are alarming or discordant with the</text><text start="207.68" dur="4.88">conventional wisdom</text><text start="209.519" dur="4.08">and the world neatly divides into people</text><text start="212.56" dur="4.0">who will be</text><text start="213.599" dur="3.521">so enraged or thrown by what you&apos;re</text><text start="216.56" dur="3.599">saying</text><text start="217.12" dur="5.679">that they uh disappear</text><text start="220.159" dur="3.44">or maybe they become antagonists at a</text><text start="222.799" dur="3.281">distance</text><text start="223.599" dur="4.081">and the people who have a similar</text><text start="226.08" dur="2.96">experience and therefore aren&apos;t thrown</text><text start="227.68" dur="3.6">by the fact that you&apos;re saying things</text><text start="229.04" dur="6.479">that are out of phase and so</text><text start="231.28" dur="6.48">editing the world down to those who are</text><text start="235.519" dur="4.72">comfortable with what they don&apos;t know</text><text start="237.76" dur="5.44">who are interested in following things</text><text start="240.239" dur="3.36">where they lead irrespective of who that</text><text start="243.2" dur="3.52">uh</text><text start="243.599" dur="5.441">elevates and and who it uh um</text><text start="246.72" dur="4.079">hobbles those people are interesting</text><text start="249.04" dur="5.119">people to hang out with and</text><text start="250.799" dur="4.72">so yes the uh the alienation may be a</text><text start="254.159" dur="4.48">blessing in disguise</text><text start="255.519" dur="4.641">in some ways there&apos;s two other thoughts</text><text start="258.639" dur="3.681">that came up as you&apos;re just talking one</text><text start="260.16" dur="2.16">is</text><text start="262.639" dur="3.681">i i wouldn&apos;t call myself an independent</text><text start="265.36" dur="3.04">thinker</text><text start="266.32" dur="3.76">i&apos;m being particular about the semantic</text><text start="268.4" dur="3.28">of the word independent i wouldn&apos;t call</text><text start="270.08" dur="2.559">anyone an independent thinker because i</text><text start="271.68" dur="2.72">think in words</text><text start="272.639" dur="3.28">invented by other people i think in</text><text start="274.4" dur="3.2">concepts invented and discovered by</text><text start="275.919" dur="5.521">other people</text><text start="277.6" dur="6.0">um i don&apos;t necessarily have a specific</text><text start="281.44" dur="5.199">school of orthodoxy from which i</text><text start="283.6" dur="4.879">take an entire world view but almost</text><text start="286.639" dur="5.84">every idea that i</text><text start="288.479" dur="6.641">believe in i did not discover and so</text><text start="292.479" dur="3.521">uh i think that&apos;s a very important</text><text start="295.12" dur="3.68">concept because i think</text><text start="296.0" dur="4.639">the the ideas we&apos;re going to discuss</text><text start="298.8" dur="4.16">today regarding democracy</text><text start="300.639" dur="4.081">and open society have to do with the</text><text start="302.96" dur="3.04">relationship between an individual and a</text><text start="304.72" dur="4.319">collective</text><text start="306.0" dur="4.4">and i think the i there</text><text start="309.039" dur="3.041">the idea of an individual is</text><text start="310.4" dur="3.28">fundamentally a misnomer without</text><text start="312.08" dur="4.08">everybody else i wouldn&apos;t be who i</text><text start="313.68" dur="4.0">am and i wouldn&apos;t think the way i think</text><text start="316.16" dur="3.68">i wouldn&apos;t think in the language i do i</text><text start="317.68" dur="4.079">wouldn&apos;t have access to</text><text start="319.84" dur="3.28">you know the knowledge that came from</text><text start="321.759" dur="2.241">the hubble telescope and the large</text><text start="323.12" dur="3.919">hadron collider</text><text start="324.0" dur="5.84">and so many things like that um</text><text start="327.039" dur="3.121">so i can say that there is a certain</text><text start="329.84" dur="3.44">like</text><text start="330.16" dur="5.12">ultimate authority that of what i</text><text start="333.28" dur="4.08">choose to feel that i believe in and</text><text start="335.28" dur="3.68">trust that has an internal locus of</text><text start="337.36" dur="4.24">control</text><text start="338.96" dur="5.76">but the information coming from without</text><text start="341.6" dur="6.72">in my own internal processing of it are</text><text start="344.72" dur="6.08">part of the same system so this is a</text><text start="348.32" dur="5.12">perfect example of what i was suggesting</text><text start="350.8" dur="4.959">up front where two people who do</text><text start="353.44" dur="4.56">whatever we&apos;re going to call this</text><text start="355.759" dur="3.44">will will have their own separate</text><text start="358.0" dur="2.88">glossaries</text><text start="359.199" dur="4.161">so if i can translate what you&apos;ve just</text><text start="360.88" dur="4.56">said i daniel schmucktenberger</text><text start="363.36" dur="4.32">am not an independent thinker because</text><text start="365.44" dur="3.039">such a thing is inconceivable in human</text><text start="367.68" dur="3.12">form</text><text start="368.479" dur="3.761">right and i totally agree with that the</text><text start="370.8" dur="4.64">fact is not only</text><text start="372.24" dur="5.76">are you interwoven with all</text><text start="375.44" dur="4.24">sorts of humans who are responsible for</text><text start="378.0" dur="2.88">conveying to you in one way or another</text><text start="379.68" dur="3.2">conclusions that</text><text start="380.88" dur="2.96">you couldn&apos;t possibly check you know</text><text start="382.88" dur="1.68">these are thoughts that would be</text><text start="383.84" dur="4.0">familiar</text><text start="384.56" dur="6.4">to descartes for example</text><text start="387.84" dur="4.16">but you are also building from the</text><text start="390.96" dur="4.079">entirety</text><text start="392.0" dur="4.88">of cumulative human culture</text><text start="395.039" dur="3.121">right all of the tools with which you</text><text start="396.88" dur="3.92">can think</text><text start="398.16" dur="4.4">are uh almost all of them are too</text><text start="400.8" dur="4.8">ancient to even know where their</text><text start="402.56" dur="4.4">rudiments originated so anyway i don&apos;t</text><text start="405.6" dur="3.2">disagree with any of that</text><text start="406.96" dur="3.519">so to me i would say there is such a</text><text start="408.8" dur="3.839">thing as an independent thinker</text><text start="410.479" dur="3.28">and in your schema it has to do with</text><text start="412.639" dur="4.241">whether or not they</text><text start="413.759" dur="6.0">are thinking a la carte that is to say</text><text start="416.88" dur="4.64">using that set of tools that is most</text><text start="419.759" dur="2.241">effective irrespective of the fact that</text><text start="421.52" dur="4.56">those tools</text><text start="422.0" dur="5.36">don&apos;t all come from one tradition</text><text start="426.08" dur="3.519">and you would say there is no</text><text start="427.36" dur="2.48">independent thought because a la carte</text><text start="429.599" dur="1.761">is</text><text start="429.84" dur="3.919">the most you can do or something like</text><text start="431.36" dur="4.16">that i might say that i like a term like</text><text start="433.759" dur="3.521">interdependent better because it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="435.52" dur="3.04">mean that there isn&apos;t an individual</text><text start="437.28" dur="3.12">involved but it means that the</text><text start="438.56" dur="4.32">individual without everyone else is also</text><text start="440.4" dur="2.48">not a thing</text><text start="443.039" dur="4.401">and so the recognition that</text><text start="447.759" dur="6.241">sovereignty and individuality is a thing</text><text start="450.96" dur="6.239">and it is conditioned by affected by</text><text start="454.0" dur="5.759">and affecting other groups of people are</text><text start="457.199" dur="3.921">both necessary in the hegelian synthesis</text><text start="459.759" dur="2.88">to understand what is the nature of a</text><text start="461.12" dur="3.12">human are they fundamentally</text><text start="462.639" dur="2.801">individual and then groups emerge are</text><text start="464.24" dur="3.28">they fundamentally tribal and they&apos;re</text><text start="465.44" dur="5.039">formed by the tribe and it&apos;s very much</text><text start="467.52" dur="3.84">both in a kind of recursive process</text><text start="470.479" dur="3.681">between them</text><text start="471.36" dur="3.839">100 in fact i once wrote something i</text><text start="474.16" dur="2.879">called the declaration of</text><text start="475.199" dur="5.201">interdependence</text><text start="477.039" dur="4.241">it was a sort of proto game b attempt to</text><text start="480.4" dur="4.0">define</text><text start="481.28" dur="4.639">uh what the rules of a functional</text><text start="484.4" dur="4.639">society</text><text start="485.919" dur="6.4">would be like and i also frequently say</text><text start="489.039" dur="6.481">that the individual is more</text><text start="492.319" dur="7.041">an illusion than it is real and what i</text><text start="495.52" dur="7.04">describe is that an individual</text><text start="499.36" dur="6.239">is a level of understanding</text><text start="502.56" dur="5.12">that evolution has focused us on</text><text start="505.599" dur="3.6">because historically it has been sort of</text><text start="507.68" dur="4.479">the limit of that</text><text start="509.199" dur="3.52">where we might have some useful control</text><text start="512.159" dur="2.88">right</text><text start="512.719" dur="3.76">evolution might ultimately care about</text><text start="515.039" dur="3.761">whether or not you are</text><text start="516.479" dur="3.521">successful your genes are still around</text><text start="518.8" dur="4.32">100 generations</text><text start="520.0" dur="5.2">from now but your focus on 100</text><text start="523.12"
