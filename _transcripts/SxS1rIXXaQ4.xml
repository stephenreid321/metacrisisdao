dur="2.58">talking about topics that everybody&apos;s</text><text start="28.92" dur="3.0">talking about right now I&apos;m just</text><text start="30.119" dur="3.361">hopefully trying to talk about them in a</text><text start="31.92" dur="4.799">slightly different way to say everyone</text><text start="33.48" dur="5.849">on all sides are oriented to do versions</text><text start="36.719" dur="5.25">of this as opposed to those guys are</text><text start="39.329" dur="4.89">virtue signaling and us calling them out</text><text start="41.969" dur="5.961">is us demonstrating our actual virtue</text><text start="44.219" dur="6.27">but we&apos;re not virtue signaling and so</text><text start="47.93" dur="4.96">one way that I think of the distinction</text><text start="50.489" dur="7.651">between real virtue and virtue signaling</text><text start="52.89" dur="7.439">is virtue signaling is when it&apos;s clear</text><text start="58.14" dur="5.61">that an enough people hold a particular</text><text start="60.329" dur="5.101">trait as a virtue that if I seem to have</text><text start="63.75" dur="3.869">that virtue it would be good for me</text><text start="65.43" dur="4.83">right the people would like me except me</text><text start="67.619" dur="5.221">agree with me by my stuff like my ideas</text><text start="70.26" dur="5.91">whatever it is so if I signal if I</text><text start="72.84" dur="5.19">communicate in some way that I have that</text><text start="76.17" dur="5.309">virtue it&apos;s beneficial for me in</text><text start="78.03" dur="5.43">straight self-serving ways right so I</text><text start="81.479" dur="4.981">have a reason to signal the virtue</text><text start="83.46" dur="5.549">beyond my authentic living of it and</text><text start="86.46" dur="4.28">this is where rather than I&apos;m just doing</text><text start="89.009" dur="5.25">what I&apos;m doing and people notice the</text><text start="90.74" dur="3.97">virtue that I happen to to be living I</text><text start="94.259" dur="2.881">am</text><text start="94.71" dur="4.44">intentionally trying to seem virtuous of</text><text start="97.14" dur="3.78">a particular kind more than I am trying</text><text start="99.15" dur="6.359">to actually live that thing right and</text><text start="100.92" dur="5.82">this is where the you know Jesus saying</text><text start="105.509" dur="3.39">don&apos;t let the right hand see what the</text><text start="106.74" dur="3.989">left hand was doing and I think every</text><text start="108.899" dur="4.11">culture that has wisdom has some quotes</text><text start="110.729" dur="4.411">like that because virtue signaling is</text><text start="113.009" dur="3.811">forever right and it&apos;s whatever the</text><text start="115.14" dur="6.2">dominant culture is whatever the thing</text><text start="116.82" dur="9.02">that is seen as virtue there so during</text><text start="121.34" dur="7.21">you know during the early Soviet empire</text><text start="125.84" dur="6.479">Marxist ideology people would virtue</text><text start="128.55" dur="5.37">signal being more Marxist right and</text><text start="132.319" dur="3.401">during</text><text start="133.92" dur="4.47">Dark Age Catholic reign the virtue</text><text start="135.72" dur="5.879">signalling was about being better</text><text start="138.39" dur="4.74">Catholics and you know so now left and</text><text start="141.599" dur="8.271">right have their own versions of virtue</text><text start="143.13" dur="9.81">signaling to their own base and so</text><text start="149.87" dur="5.199">politicians and companies and social</text><text start="152.94" dur="4.59">leaders are oriented to signal the thing</text><text start="155.069" dur="8.521">they would need to in that way a real</text><text start="157.53" dur="10.17">virtue is something that is that I care</text><text start="163.59" dur="8.19">about that I value actually hopefully</text><text start="167.7" dur="6.72">something that is sacred to me that I am</text><text start="171.78" dur="5.789">willing to experience personal sacrifice</text><text start="174.42" dur="4.83">for not that my signalling of it creates</text><text start="177.569" dur="4.2">personal gain but I am willing to lose</text><text start="179.25" dur="4.14">personal gain in service of this because</text><text start="181.769" dur="4.111">it&apos;s more important than personal gain</text><text start="183.39" dur="5.099">to me so I&apos;m willing to lose some</text><text start="185.88" dur="5.1">dollars to have my company not do that</text><text start="188.489" dur="4.321">thing because I hold a virtue or an</text><text start="190.98" dur="3.93">ethic that won&apos;t have me do that thing</text><text start="192.81" dur="3.81">even if it would make me more dollars or</text><text start="194.91" dur="4.919">I&apos;m willing to lose some followers or</text><text start="196.62" dur="4.739">get some not you know people dislike</text><text start="199.829" dur="2.311">what I&apos;m saying or whatever to stand up</text><text start="201.359" dur="3.871">for something because I actually</text><text start="202.14" dur="4.8">meaningfully believe in it right most</text><text start="205.23" dur="3.47">people are willing to be disliked by the</text><text start="206.94" dur="4.139">group that they identify as enemies</text><text start="208.7" dur="3.4">though they might even take pride in it</text><text start="211.079" dur="4.41">because they&apos;re doing in-group out-group</text><text start="212.1" dur="5.91">Machiavellian stuff but am I willing to</text><text start="215.489" dur="3.931">lose likes and support by the people</text><text start="218.01" dur="3.15">that I&apos;m trying to end group with is</text><text start="219.42" dur="2.7">where it&apos;s actually consequential</text><text start="221.16" dur="2.73">because losing the ones that I&apos;ve</text><text start="222.12" dur="3.239">already lost isn&apos;t consequential so then</text><text start="223.89" dur="3.33">I get to weaponize see I&apos;m willing to</text><text start="225.359" dur="4.171">make a sacrifice and have enemies which</text><text start="227.22" dur="7.47">is actually weaponizing the idea of</text><text start="229.53" dur="6.66">sacrifice itself we can also see that</text><text start="234.69" dur="4.23">so yeah the difference between virtue</text><text start="236.19" dur="4.379">and virtue signaling is real virtue is</text><text start="238.92" dur="3.45">not trying to signal to other people</text><text start="240.569" dur="4.321">something it is trying to actually live</text><text start="242.37" dur="5.19">something and it is willing to stand for</text><text start="244.89" dur="5.4">something where it is personally</text><text start="247.56" dur="4.769">disadvantageous and so you can see</text><text start="250.29" dur="3.63">someone&apos;s virtue in the series of</text><text start="252.329" dur="4.921">choices they have made that have been</text><text start="253.92" dur="4.68">hard choices so when someone tells me</text><text start="257.25" dur="3.18">that they&apos;re interested in impact</text><text start="258.6" dur="4.559">investing with their financial services</text><text start="260.43" dur="6.06">fund I go through and I say show me in</text><text start="263.159" dur="4.441">record the series of investment choices</text><text start="266.49" dur="3.78">you made</text><text start="267.6" dur="5.22">where you turn down money because of an</text><text start="270.27" dur="5.04">ethic just show me the the record of</text><text start="272.82" dur="5.25">those and usually they can&apos;t do a good</text><text start="275.31" dur="5.73">job at that and then I say off</text><text start="278.07" dur="5.22">because I know that now impact investing</text><text start="281.04" dur="4.47">just happens to be the virtue that</text><text start="283.29" dur="5.36">signals a particular niche of capital or</text><text start="285.51" dur="9.36">whatever but there&apos;s no real earnest ISM</text><text start="288.65" dur="6.91">[Music]</text><text start="294.87" dur="5.11">you</text><text start="295.56"
