we</text><text start="29.76" dur="2.4">get into the subject</text><text start="31.38" dur="3.0">um</text><text start="32.16" dur="4.86">hear a bit about your Reflections on</text><text start="34.38" dur="5.76">that I mean I felt fear about thinking</text><text start="37.02" dur="6.74">about this uh for a few hours and you</text><text start="40.14" dur="6.72">spend your days and your life engaging</text><text start="43.76" dur="5.08">in thinking about existential and</text><text start="46.86" dur="4.34">catastrophic risks how how do you deal</text><text start="48.84" dur="2.36">with that</text><text start="51.539" dur="2.961">it&apos;s working all right</text><text start="55.14" dur="4.8">well first I just wanted to say</text><text start="57.48" dur="4.559">that I think your intro where you shared</text><text start="59.94" dur="4.079">personally that it was scary to come up</text><text start="62.039" dur="3.961">here but you got over it because in the</text><text start="64.019" dur="4.821">face of the issues we face as a world</text><text start="66.0" dur="6.0">you get over your own personal stuff</text><text start="68.84" dur="5.56">one of the things that is critical for</text><text start="72.0" dur="4.5">us to address the meta crisis is a</text><text start="74.4" dur="4.74">certain kind of courage to be willing to</text><text start="76.5" dur="4.2">look at the things that are scary that</text><text start="79.14" dur="4.019">will break our current theories of</text><text start="80.7" dur="4.14">change and we&apos;ll we&apos;ll have a while</text><text start="83.159" dur="3.6">where we don&apos;t know what a new solution</text><text start="84.84" dur="3.72">is and we have to be willing to go</text><text start="86.759" dur="3.54">through that adaptive Valley to come up</text><text start="88.56" dur="4.08">with solutions that might be adequate so</text><text start="90.299" dur="3.721">you just model that beautifully and a</text><text start="92.64" dur="4.68">vulnerability and a strength in that</text><text start="94.02" dur="4.26">I&apos;ll just add in case it&apos;s humanizing</text><text start="97.32" dur="3.96">um</text><text start="98.28" dur="4.92">I don&apos;t like public speaking</text><text start="101.28" dur="4.5">um never</text><text start="103.2" dur="5.82">yeah</text><text start="105.78" dur="4.92">I uh my that&apos;s why I even like hold the</text><text start="109.02" dur="3.66">mic away</text><text start="110.7" dur="4.26">my first experience is public speaking</text><text start="112.68" dur="3.96">were just like a panic attack and I got</text><text start="114.96" dur="3.78">over it because the topics mattered</text><text start="116.64" dur="4.2">enough to me I still get over it every</text><text start="118.74" dur="3.18">time before I talk</text><text start="120.84" dur="2.94">um</text><text start="121.92" dur="4.5">but I think it&apos;s a good example of the</text><text start="123.78" dur="4.38">kinds of sacrifices that are important</text><text start="126.42" dur="5.22">and as we&apos;re talking about this today</text><text start="128.16" dur="6.06">it&apos;s like why do we want people to know</text><text start="131.64" dur="4.92">about</text><text start="134.22" dur="4.92">really consequential</text><text start="136.56" dur="4.38">like maximally consequential scary</text><text start="139.14" dur="4.44">things that they don&apos;t have any obvious</text><text start="140.94" dur="4.019">agency to fix</text><text start="143.58" dur="4.32">um</text><text start="144.959" dur="4.681">and why do we not just go straight to</text><text start="147.9" dur="3.78">Solutions</text><text start="149.64" dur="3.48">because there are not solutions to go</text><text start="151.68" dur="4.559">straight to that are adequate to the</text><text start="153.12" dur="6.42">problems yet it requires more people</text><text start="156.239" dur="4.321">being engaged in the earnest Endeavor to</text><text start="159.54" dur="3.66">find them</text><text start="160.56" dur="4.98">which requires them being engaged in</text><text start="163.2" dur="4.44">contact with reality as it is which does</text><text start="165.54" dur="4.919">require like an earnestness and a</text><text start="167.64" dur="7.08">courage and like that so</text><text start="170.459" dur="6.541">um on the topic of I give a talk at a</text><text start="174.72" dur="4.92">conference in Turkey the other day and</text><text start="177.0" dur="7.019">there&apos;s a very strong emphasis in the</text><text start="179.64" dur="8.099">audience to be optimistic and</text><text start="184.019" dur="6.661">it&apos;s a funny thing the what I would hope</text><text start="187.739" dur="6.841">for is a kind of post-cynical optimism</text><text start="190.68" dur="4.559">there is a naive optimism which is</text><text start="194.58" dur="2.519">um</text><text start="195.239" dur="4.741">naive optimism has a lot of different</text><text start="197.099" dur="4.681">voices the voices are like there have</text><text start="199.98" dur="4.02">always been challenges and Humanity just</text><text start="201.78" dur="4.02">arrives Rises to the challenge and Tech</text><text start="204.0" dur="3.86">will solve everything and we&apos;ll get AI</text><text start="205.8" dur="5.159">and it&apos;ll solve everything and whatever</text><text start="207.86" dur="4.78">and these are not well thought through</text><text start="210.959" dur="3.661">theories of change</text><text start="212.64" dur="3.179">or everything&apos;s getting better and there</text><text start="214.62" dur="2.58">are problems but the problems are less</text><text start="215.819" dur="2.28">bad than the ones we used to have and</text><text start="217.2" dur="2.16">everything will keep getting better</text><text start="218.099" dur="4.86">through Tech and capitalism and</text><text start="219.36" dur="5.7">Innovation this is the apologism we tell</text><text start="222.959" dur="3.601">ourselves to keep doing the standard</text><text start="225.06" dur="4.259">model</text><text start="226.56" dur="5.819">um so there&apos;s a certain kind of naive</text><text start="229.319" dur="5.581">optimism it has many flavors that hasn&apos;t</text><text start="232.379" dur="4.801">encountered the depth and complexity of</text><text start="234.9" dur="3.96">the problem space when you start to</text><text start="237.18" dur="3.059">encounter the depth and complexity of</text><text start="238.86" dur="3.84">the problem space</text><text start="240.239" dur="5.481">uh there is a cynicism and a nihilism</text><text start="242.7" dur="5.94">that can occur that looks like</text><text start="245.72" dur="4.5">impossible to solve how can</text><text start="248.64" dur="4.92">how can</text><text start="250.22" dur="5.019">evolutionarily nasty chimpanzees that</text><text start="253.56" dur="4.919">have a very high orientation for</text><text start="255.239" dur="5.701">conflict and irrationality with nuclear</text><text start="258.479" dur="4.521">weapons and Ai and synthetic biology who</text><text start="260.94" dur="3.86">have the history of using our technology</text><text start="263.0" dur="3.94">as</text><text start="264.8" dur="4.24">conflict-oriented and harm externalizing</text><text start="266.94" dur="4.08">as we have how can 8 billion of us with</text><text start="269.04" dur="3.54">exponential Tech do a good job of</text><text start="271.02" dur="4.8">governing that much power doesn&apos;t</text><text start="272.58" dur="6.119">actually look promising</text><text start="275.82" dur="4.8">and that the solutions to most of the</text><text start="278.699" dur="5.821">problems look like making another</text><text start="280.62" dur="6.56">problem worse you recognize that in the</text><text start="284.52" dur="6.239">age of</text><text start="287.18" dur="6.519">exponential Tech which democratizes</text><text start="290.759" dur="5.641">which decentralizes exponential power</text><text start="293.699" dur="5.641">that also means decentralizes and</text><text start="296.4" dur="4.92">democratizes catastrophic power</text><text start="299.34" dur="4.079">and while we like the term democratize</text><text start="301.32" dur="3.96">in some ways democratize catastrophe</text><text start="303.419" dur="3.361">weapons for everyone is actually not a</text><text start="305.28" dur="4.38">nice world</text><text start="306.78" dur="5.1">the first real catastrophic weapon the</text><text start="309.66" dur="3.66">world ever came up with was the bomb and</text><text start="311.88" dur="3.36">it was fortunate that the bomb was just</text><text start="313.32" dur="3.48">really hard to make and because it was</text><text start="315.24" dur="3.54">really hard to make you could limit the</text><text start="316.8" dur="3.6">number of players who could make it and</text><text start="318.78" dur="4.199">so you just had two for a very long time</text><text start="320.4" dur="4.26">with one catastrophe weapon and two</text><text start="322.979" dur="3.841">players you can have mutually assured</text><text start="324.66" dur="4.319">destruction and force in equilibrium</text><text start="326.82" dur="3.42">with even a G8 or a small number of</text><text start="328.979" dur="2.521">players that can monitor each other</text><text start="330.24" dur="2.34">through satellites you can force an</text><text start="331.5" dur="3.419">equilibrium</text><text start="332.58" dur="3.899">but when you have a very large number of</text><text start="334.919" dur="2.761">players with catastrophe weapons where</text><text start="336.479" dur="2.581">you don&apos;t even know who the players are</text><text start="337.68" dur="3.12">in their catastrophe weapons of a</text><text start="339.06" dur="3.359">different type because you can do Gene</text><text start="340.8" dur="4.14">synthesis in a basement</text><text start="342.419" dur="3.601">or because you can make drone weapons in</text><text start="344.94" dur="2.58">basements</text><text start="346.02" dur="3.78">well how does the world make it through</text><text start="347.52" dur="3.78">that the only people that have thought</text><text start="349.8" dur="2.82">about it well mostly come up with</text><text start="351.3" dur="4.38">surveillance answers we have to know</text><text start="352.62" dur="8.48">what people are doing in basements</text><text start="355.68" dur="7.98">well then you get up dystopias or</text><text start="361.1" dur="4.3">the answer that&apos;s going to make climate</text><text start="363.66" dur="3.539">change better which is pricing carbon</text><text start="365.4" dur="4.38">properly and putting heavy taxes on it</text><text start="367.199" dur="4.44">well how do some leading countries do</text><text start="369.78" dur="3.66">that if the other countries don&apos;t or the</text><text start="371.639" dur="3.301">damage to the GDP of the countries that</text><text start="373.44" dur="4.259">do it relative to the other ones just</text><text start="374.94" dur="4.319">means seeding power there so if the</text><text start="377.699" dur="2.761">Western Alliance does that then you&apos;re</text><text start="379.259" dur="2.94">actually just saying the Chinese</text><text start="380.46" dur="5.459">communism runs the world and on and on</text><text start="382.199" dur="6.361">there&apos;s we can grow more food</text><text start="385.919" dur="4.801">for people using nitrogen fertilizer</text><text start="388.56" dur="5.46">that causes dead zones and oceans faster</text><text start="390.72" dur="4.86">so most of our approach to problem</text><text start="394.02" dur="3.84">solving is looking at the problem too</text><text start="395.58" dur="3.6">narrowly defining a solution to that</text><text start="397.86" dur="3.48">problem</text><text start="399.18" dur="3.78">that externalizes harm to other problems</text><text start="401.34" dur="3.9">with a cumulative effect of all of that</text><text start="402.96" dur="4.32">as a self-terminating system</text><text start="405.24" dur="3.72">and so either you solve one catastrophe</text><text start="407.28" dur="4.199">make another one worse or you solve all</text><text start="408.96" dur="4.32">catastrophes and make dystopias by</text><text start="411.479" dur="3.541">creating strong enough control</text><text start="413.28" dur="3.78">mechanisms</text><text start="415.02" dur="4.5">that don&apos;t have checks and balances on</text><text start="417.06" dur="4.62">themselves so we&apos;re in search of a third</text><text start="419.52" dur="3.48">possibility that is neither catastrophe</text><text start="421.68" dur="3.72">or dystopia</text><text start="423.0" dur="4.74">to not be catastrophe means</text><text start="425.4" dur="3.78">that it has to be able to check all of</text><text start="427.74" dur="3.899">the catastrophes that are otherwise</text><text start="429.18" dur="4.26">impending which means all of the</text><text start="431.639" dur="2.941">perverse incentive Market forces that</text><text start="433.44" dur="3.539">are driving us towards planetary</text><text start="434.58" dur="5.58">boundaries all of the incentives towards</text><text start="436.979" dur="5.821">large-scale Warfare on and on as well as</text><text start="440.16" dur="4.319">what happens in basements and synthetic</text><text start="442.8" dur="4.2">biology labs</text><text start="444.479" dur="4.921">and to not be dystopic means the power</text><text start="447.0" dur="4.02">that can witness all that surveil it</text><text start="449.4" dur="3.84">whatever you want to call it and can</text><text start="451.02" dur="4.2">regulate it has to have checks and</text><text start="453.24" dur="3.66">balances on itself and yet it&apos;ll operate</text><text start="455.22" dur="3.599">at such a level of complexity that the</text><text start="456.9" dur="3.54">asymmetry of it is so far from what an</text><text start="458.819" dur="3.961">individual can process how do you</text><text start="460.44" dur="4.56">possibly adjudicate that or democratize</text><text start="462.78" dur="3.6">that this is super complicated and there</text><text start="465.0" dur="3.36">are solutions but it&apos;s very much</text><text start="466.38" dur="4.56">threading the eye of a needle</text><text start="468.36" dur="4.98">but we do have to so</text><text start="470.94" dur="3.78">there are naive optimism that just</text><text start="473.34" dur="2.759">doesn&apos;t understand the complexity you</text><text start="474.72" dur="4.8">start to understand all this complexity</text><text start="476.099" dur="5.761">and see that the self-determination is</text><text start="479.52" dur="4.679">almost over determined by the core</text><text start="481.86" dur="3.899">nature of the system that we live in the</text><text start="484.199" dur="3.72">core nature of the interconnected</text><text start="485.759" dur="4.141">systems that we live in and that our</text><text start="487.919" dur="2.881">solution processes itself part of the</text><text start="489.9" dur="2.519">problem</text><text start="490.8" dur="4.32">the way that we have gone about doing</text><text start="492.419" dur="4.381">Solutions historically we don&apos;t get to</text><text start="495.12" dur="3.84">just say well we&apos;ve always had problems</text><text start="496.8" dur="4.32">in Necessities some other of innovation</text><text start="498.96" dur="5.22">and we&apos;ll indent new and because</text><text start="501.12" dur="5.46">that process itself causes bigger</text><text start="504.18" dur="3.84">problems not just new ones but</text><text start="506.58" dur="2.88">fundamentally bigger ones because there</text><text start="508.02" dur="3.54">has to be some scale at which the</text><text start="509.46" dur="3.36">solution overtakes the problem I&apos;ll go</text><text start="511.56" dur="2.64">ahead and expand on that a little bit</text><text start="512.82" dur="3.86">because it&apos;s important people haven&apos;t</text><text start="514.2" dur="2.48">thought of it</text><text start="518.159" dur="4.62">climate change</text><text start="520.08" dur="4.379">is a pretty big issue it</text><text start="522.779" dur="3.781">uh is obviously threatening</text><text

dur="4.98">producing extreme weather events that</text><text start="538.5" dur="5.22">are a pretty big deal right drought in</text><text start="540.3" dur="5.94">Syria caused a massive issue that the</text><text start="543.72" dur="4.2">human migration Refugee issues from that</text><text start="546.24" dur="2.94">are still having shocks throughout the</text><text start="547.92"

dur="4.48">so in general when we&apos;re trying to solve</text><text start="762.66" dur="3.72">a problem</text><text start="764.04" dur="4.68">we Define the problem in a narrow way</text><text

dur="4.5">right we don&apos;t Define it broadly enough</text><text start="779.579" dur="3.781">and so then we come up with a solution</text><text start="781.32" dur="4.019">and the solution is either a law or a</text><text start="783.36" dur="4.5">business or a technology or something</text><text start="785.339" dur="4.201">like that a non-profit where the</text><text start="787.86" dur="3.3">solution is going to produce a first</text><text start="789.54" dur="4.5">order effect meaning we will directly</text><text start="791.16" dur="4.32">produce this effect on some small number</text><text start="794.04" dur="3.539">of metrics that we&apos;re measuring the</text><text start="795.48" dur="3.96">problem with and it&apos;ll do that it&apos;s</text><text start="797.579"

dur="5.279">can&apos;t get over very practical and do</text><text start="892.62" dur="5.7">legislation that the local</text><text start="895.079" dur="6.12">country increased the S the

that</text><text start="932.04" dur="3.299">and I&apos;m like we did all this</text><text start="933.54" dur="3.599">tremendously hard work other people much</text><text start="935.339" dur="3.841">more than me</text><text start="937.139" dur="4.14">and we moved it to a more sensitive</text><text start="939.18" dur="4.32">worse area</text><text start="941.279" dur="3.601">and that was a massive existential shock</text><text start="943.5" dur="3.0">for me because I had already had the</text><text start="944.88" dur="3.54">first existential shock of seeing a</text><text start="946.5" dur="3.72">factory farm and feeling like</text><text start="948.42" dur="3.24">it&apos;s not will there be an arm again</text><text start="950.22" dur="2.82">there&apos;s already an

Armageddon of that sort</text><text start="961.56" dur="3.959">and I&apos;m like when I was a kid thinking</text><text start="964.199" dur="3.841">about that first there was this question</text><text start="965.519" dur="4.26">of if I know what&apos;s happening in a</text><text start="968.04" dur="4.739">factory farm if I know what&apos;s happening</text><text start="969.779" dur="5.401">in a Thai child sex shop if I know all</text><text start="972.779" dur="4.5">those things</text><text start="975.18" dur="4.88">can my life feel like a success while</text><text start="977.279" dur="2.781">that&apos;s still happening</text><text start="980.639" dur="3.901">and I&apos;m like I have to be a sociopath</text><text start="982.74" dur="3.539">for my life to be a success because I</text><text start="984.54" dur="4.32">have to separate myself from the other</text><text start="986.279" dur="4.201">sentient beings so much where ultimately</text><text start="988.86" dur="3.74">I&apos;m just luckier than them that I&apos;m not</text><text start="990.48" dur="5.46">born into that situation there&apos;s no</text><text start="992.6" dur="4.78">meritocracy of why that&apos;s the case and</text><text start="995.94" dur="4.68">they can&apos;t get themselves out of it and</text><text start="997.38" dur="4.68">maybe I can so the only way I can&apos;t kill</text><text start="1000.62" dur="2.88">myself because that doesn&apos;t help any of</text><text start="1002.06" dur="3.3">them</text><text start="1003.5" dur="3.839">so the only way to actually have life be</text><text start="1005.36" dur="3.839">a success what it said at the end if it</text><text start="1007.339" dur="3.541">wins for you it wins for everyone if it</text><text start="1009.199" dur="3.481">doesn&apos;t actually win for everyone it</text><text start="1010.88" dur="4.62">can&apos;t be a success right</text><text start="1012.68" dur="4.019">and uh so I&apos;m like all right well let&apos;s</text><text start="1015.5" dur="2.459">at least do the activism and figure out</text><text start="1016.699" dur="3.181">how to solve it so then when I saw that</text><text start="1017.959" dur="3.601">the activism moved the problems and</text><text start="1019.88" dur="3.72">didn&apos;t actually work and moved it to</text><text start="1021.56" dur="4.2">more sensitive areas that was the next</text><text start="1023.6" dur="4.079">existential shock</text><text start="1025.76" dur="3.72">and then I&apos;m like well</text><text start="1027.679" dur="3.12">does it do that in other places and then</text><text start="1029.48" dur="2.939">I&apos;m like all right well this solution to</text><text start="1030.799" dur="3.301">Poverty to make a hydroelectric Dam</text><text start="1032.419" dur="4.5">drown this whole area and extinct a</text><text start="1034.1" dur="4.319">whole bunch of species and this

dur="3.36">areas that didn&apos;t have it that led to</text><text start="1041.9" dur="3.12">dead zones and oceans faster and then</text><text start="1043.699" dur="2.401">when I talked to the guys about it they</text><text start="1045.02" dur="4.5">said those aren&apos;t the metrics we&apos;re</text><text start="1046.1" dur="5.78">tasked with and on and on and I&apos;m like</text><text start="1053.48" dur="5.04">the solution space collectively is not</text><text start="1056.12" dur="4.679">converging on the problem space</text><text start="1058.52" dur="5.58">the problem space is actually taking off</text><text start="1060.799" dur="5.341">relative to the solution space</text><text start="1064.1" dur="2.88">so then that got me to think about all</text><text start="1066.14" dur="2.399">right</text><text start="1066.98" dur="3.12">how do we</text><text start="1068.539" dur="3.181">if we really want to stop the elephant</text><text start="1070.1" dur="4.199">poaching and not cause other problems</text><text start="1071.72" dur="4.079">you probably have to deal with how do</text><text start="1074.299" dur="3.541">you make an elephant Worth More Alive</text><text

dur="3.84">probably knows</text><text start="1109.58" dur="4.86">it&apos;s worth noting that</text><text start="1111.62" dur="4.64">a lot of the metrics of quality of life</text><text start="1114.44"

start="2141.16" dur="2.88">there&apos;s of course truth to that other</text><text start="2142.72" dur="2.52">people would say no the social structure</text><text start="2144.04" dur="4.68">layer the culture layer is more</text><text start="2145.24" dur="5.46">fundamental because the culture if the</text><text start="2148.72" dur="3.48">governance is not an instantiation of</text><text

something classified let&apos;s</text><text start="4407.239" dur="3.601">say that we were to share with the</text><text start="4408.44" dur="3.98">public that means we are sharing with</text><text

and in that world and you</text><text start="4429.86" dur="5.28">know 17 whatever the</text><text start="4432.5" dur="4.62">there was no way for a message of what</text><text start="4435.14"

dur="3.12">way away and</text><text start="4444.739" dur="3.601">once you start to get the Telegraph and</text><text start="4446.6" dur="4.26">then Wireless Communications and on and</text><text start="4448.34" dur="4.319">on you get to a situation where actually</text><text start="4450.86" dur="3.48">you can&apos;t share honestly with your own</text><text start="4452.659" dur="3.54">citizens because you&apos;re sharing with</text><text start="4454.34" dur="3.899">your foe so you have to classify more</text><text start="4456.199" dur="3.601">stuff and as soon as there&apos;s more types</text><text start="4458.239" dur="3.0">of warfare you can&apos;t even share with the</text><text start="4459.8" dur="3.12">citizens where the food is stored or</text><text start="4461.239" dur="2.94">where the water supply is or whether</text><text start="4462.92" dur="3.18">anything because all of those could be</text><text start="4464.179" dur="3.48">military targets so you start to get a</text><text start="4466.1" dur="2.88">situation where almost everything is a</text><text start="4467.659" dur="2.821">national security secret well how the</text><text start="4468.98" dur="3.239"> is democracy supposed to work and</text><text start="4470.48" dur="3.239">when the citizens can tell that</text><text start="4472.219" dur="3.661">everything is being kept from them and</text><text start="4473.719" dur="4.261">they have distrust in government so then</text><text start="4475.88" dur="3.299">that orients towards despotic leaders</text><text start="4477.98"

telling me here and I</text><text start="4483.08" dur="3.659">don&apos;t know all the details but he was</text><text start="4484.4" dur="6.36">saying that</text><text start="4486.739" dur="5.581">um seeing that and Sweden knowing that</text><text start="4490.76" dur="5.399">being between</text><text start="4492.32" dur="8.58">the USSR earlier and the us or the</text><text start="4496.159" dur="7.201">European uh you know side that it wasn&apos;t</text><text start="4500.9" dur="4.5">going to be able to maintain information</text><text start="4503.36" dur="3.42">asymmetry that long the Russians would</text><text start="4505.4" dur="3.0">figure the stuff out the US would figure</text><text start="4506.78" dur="3.72">the stuff out</text><text start="4508.4" dur="4.5">um so they would just not declassify the</text><text start="4510.5" dur="3.96">stuff be able to have more Trust of</text><text start="4512.9" dur="2.759">their population in government and be</text><text start="4514.46" dur="3.779">able to have more sharing of the stuff</text><text start="4515.659" dur="4.741">inside and even though that meant they</text><text start="4518.239" dur="4.621">weren&apos;t going to have asymmetric attack</text><text start="4520.4" dur="3.839">information they could invest all the</text><text start="4522.86" dur="3.0">resource that goes into classification</text><text start="4524.239" dur="3.301">to other types of security and he was</text><text start="4525.86" dur="3.48">saying we actually found other peaks in</text><text start="4527.54" dur="4.139">the Adaptive landscape</text><text start="4529.34" dur="4.56">and where transparency rather than</text><text start="4531.679" dur="4.261">opaqueness one and that was fascinating</text><text start="4533.9" dur="4.74">because the opaqueness is what drives</text><text start="4535.94" dur="5.64">all the coordination failures right if I</text><text start="4538.64" dur="4.559">don&apos;t know if you&apos;re doing bioweapons in</text><text start="4541.58" dur="3.84">an underground lab I have to assume you</text><text start="4543.199" dur="4.141">are and do them as well if we have</text><text start="4545.42" dur="3.6">adequate transparency then we can</text><text start="4547.34" dur="4.26">actually create agreements</text><text start="4549.02" dur="4.5">and so Upstream from the ability for</text><text start="4551.6" dur="3.42">agreements is the transparency to know</text><text start="4553.52" dur="4.44">if the agreement is being kept or not</text><text start="4555.02" dur="5.88">and I asked him I&apos;m like well</text><text start="4557.96" dur="5.699">that is kind of easy for a country that</text><text start="4560.9" dur="5.1">isn&apos;t at the front of the total</text><text start="4563.659" dur="3.901">geopolitical arms race and has backing</text><text start="4566.0" dur="4.86">of ones that are do you think that could</text><text start="4567.56" dur="5.24">be applied to China or to U.S</text><text start="4570.86" dur="5.22">um he said that he thought that it could</text><text start="4572.8" dur="6.46">and you know I</text><text start="4576.08" dur="4.5">um I&apos;ve been thinking about this more</text><text start="4579.26" dur="3.78">if</text><text start="4580.58" dur="4.44">we were to</text><text start="4583.04" dur="4.139">declassify a bunch of things we would</text><text start="4585.02" dur="4.02">open up a lot of vulnerability</text><text start="4587.179" dur="5.641">but we would also open up a lot of</text><text start="4589.04" dur="5.76">capacity to create less duplication more</text><text start="4592.82" dur="3.54">Synergy and better coordination that</text><text start="4594.8" dur="3.48">might not have been usable earlier</text><text start="4596.36" dur="3.12">before we could share all that data but</text><text start="4598.28" dur="3.54">with</text><text start="4599.48" dur="4.199">with this as a positive application of</text><text start="4601.82" dur="3.24">AI being able to find where something</text><text start="4603.679" dur="3.361">that was figured out in one place could</text><text start="4605.06"

an</text><text start="4610.34" dur="3.899">example of something that I think you</text><text start="4612.199" dur="5.04">know yes entirely possible and of course</text><text start="4614.239" dur="6.841">there&apos;s a million examples where I think</text><text start="4617.239" dur="6.121">um smaller countries</text><text start="4621.08" dur="3.599">wealthier countries you know not just</text><text start="4623.36" dur="2.7">Northern countries I think we have a lot</text><text start="4624.679" dur="2.821">to learn from Japan I think we have a</text><text start="4626.06"

start="4706.699" dur="6.301">it was a beautiful invitation to let go</text><text start="4710.78" dur="4.08">of certainty and then I was thinking</text><text start="4713.0" dur="4.26">where am I still holding on to certainty</text><text start="4714.86" dur="4.56">because I&apos;m holding on to a lot of it</text><text start="4717.26" dur="3.6">and then you said</text><text start="4719.42" dur="3.9">what if</text><text start="4720.86" dur="4.5">Facebook&apos;s algorithm or whatever social</text><text start="4723.32" dur="3.6">media&apos;s algorithm were turned the other</text><text

am</text><text start="4732.26" dur="4.14">so certain of as the great evil because</text><text start="4734.36" dur="4.64">that&apos;s my particular</text><text start="4736.4" dur="6.9">uh you know story</text><text start="4739.0" dur="5.679">and think as gr as deep as that evil is</text><text start="4743.3" dur="3.419">to me</text><text start="4744.679" dur="5.881">you could actually spin it

dur="3.359">you&apos;re in essence inviting us in the</text><text start="4755.54" dur="3.24">other direction and saying like as far</text><text start="4757.219" dur="3.96">as the darkness can go the light can go</text><text start="4758.78" dur="4.02">which is beautiful it&apos;s just a beautiful</text><text start="4761.179" dur="3.48">way to think about it and then I was</text><text

start="4768.679" dur="5.881">the the thing with social media which is</text><text start="4771.98" dur="4.86">so tough for me is</text><text start="4774.56" dur="4.5">pretty much everyone doesn&apos;t like it and</text><text start="4776.84" dur="2.94">doesn&apos;t want to be using it</text><text start="4779.06" dur="2.34">um</text><text start="4779.78" dur="3.36">and</text><text start="4781.4"

dur="3.9">a deeper way I would frame this because</text><text start="4842.179" dur="4.02">you can say why aren&apos;t we making more</text><text start="4843.8" dur="4.8">movement on the social media

interesting answer I was thinking</text><text start="4866.179" dur="5.0">about this morning as I was walking to a</text><text start="4867.739" dur="3.44">coffee shop here I got here this morning</text><text start="4872.239" dur="6.181">I can&apos;t see these problems</text><text start="4875.179" dur="4.861">right like I can&apos;t actually see climate</text><text start="4878.42" dur="3.84">change it&apos;s a hyper object that I can</text><text start="4880.04" dur="3.72">only understand through abstractions and</text><text start="4882.26" dur="2.22">math</text><text start="4883.76" dur="4.14">um</text><text start="4884.48" dur="7.02">I can&apos;t see species Extinction</text><text start="4887.9" dur="6.66">uh I can&apos;t see nuclear threat right</text><text start="4891.5" dur="5.219">they&apos;re all I can see a nuclear bomb but</text><text start="4894.56" dur="4.139">that is not nuclear threat right nuclear</text><text start="4896.719" dur="3.421">threat is the total geopolitical Arsenal</text><text start="4898.699" dur="3.661">and all the frailties that go along with</text><text start="4900.14" dur="6.24">it and blah blah I

objects</text><text start="4912.56" dur="4.44">and so I have to understand them through</text><text start="4914.719" dur="6.0">the highest forms of abstract cognition</text><text start="4917.0" dur="5.58">and yet my sensory experience especially</text><text start="4920.719" dur="4.101">if I&apos;m in somewhere like Sweden is</text><text start="4922.58" dur="6.3">things seem pretty good</text><text start="4924.82" dur="6.64">and so there&apos;s this dissonance between</text><text start="4928.88" dur="4.799">my direct experience and my</text><text start="4931.46" dur="4.32">understanding and yet I&apos;m also told that</text><text start="4933.679" dur="4.02">I&apos;m being disinformed so is my thought</text><text start="4935.78" dur="4.68">of the catastrophe disinformation and</text><text start="4937.699" dur="3.841">and and now I&apos;m actually busy and I have</text><text start="4940.46" dur="3.3">some other to get back to so I&apos;m</text><text start="4941.54" dur="4.22">gonna stop thinking about it</text><text start="4943.76" dur="2.0">um</text><text start="4946.04" dur="6.24">when I go on Facebook I don&apos;t experience</text><text start="4948.52" dur="5.159">I don&apos;t experience Russian and Chinese</text><text start="4952.28" dur="3.18">and North Korean driven</text><text start="4953.679" dur="3.581">population-centric Warfare that is</text><text start="4955.46" dur="3.12">targeting specific groups with this info</text><text start="4957.26" dur="3.0">to turn strong countries against</text><text start="4958.58"

with</text><text start="4963.44" dur="3.36">and even if it&apos;s pissing me off and</text><text start="4965.239" dur="3.541">polarizing me</text><text start="4966.8" dur="4.919">I&apos;m already sure I&apos;m right so I like it</text><text start="4968.78" dur="5.28">right it&apos;s just it&apos;s just making me feel</text><text start="4971.719" dur="4.561">badly about the people that are so dumb</text><text start="4974.06" dur="3.54">and so that I feel more motivated to do</text><text start="4976.28" dur="3.84">the good thing</text><text start="4977.6" dur="4.079">um and yet I also see my friends</text><text start="4980.12" dur="4.32">birthdays and stuff that I want to see</text><text start="4981.679" dur="5.281">and I want to post on there and so my</text><text start="4984.44" dur="4.259">and this is the asymmetry of if I cut</text><text start="4986.96" dur="4.56">down a tree</text><text start="4988.699" dur="6.121">I don&apos;t get to breathe less</text><text start="4991.52" dur="6.12">the tiny marginal effect that has on</text><text start="4994.82" dur="5.16">decreasing oxygen production and CO2</text><text start="4997.64" dur="4.92">sequestering I still get to breathe so</text><text start="4999.98" dur="4.86">it does the harm that occurs is so</text><text start="5002.56" dur="4.26">marginal I don&apos;t notice it but the</text><text start="5004.84" dur="3.72">advantage I get from being able to sell</text><text start="5006.82" dur="3.78">the lumber is immediate real advantage</text><text start="5008.56" dur="3.84">to me where if I leave the tree up I</text><text start="5010.6" dur="4.079">don&apos;t breathe any better and yet I don&apos;t</text><text start="5012.4" dur="3.839">get that advantage</text><text start="5014.679" dur="4.261">so</text><text start="5016.239" dur="4.741">everyone doing the harmful thing that</text><text start="5018.94" dur="3.6">causes a micro harm that produces the</text><text start="5020.98" dur="4.56">great harm through cumulative effects</text><text start="5022.54" dur="5.4">and yet the the direct benefit happens</text><text start="5025.54" dur="4.679">to them in the moment the harm is</text><text start="5027.94" dur="3.66">invisible and happens supposedly over a</text><text start="5030.219" dur="4.44">very long time as a result of everybody</text><text start="5031.6" dur="4.74">doing the thing this is a real challenge</text><text start="5034.659" dur="3.901">right this requires something like</text><text start="5036.34" dur="3.6">Khan&apos;s categorical imperative right I&apos;m</text><text start="5038.56" dur="4.2">going to bind myself to what I would</text><text start="5039.94" dur="4.38">want everybody to do it requires a</text><text start="5042.76" dur="3.84">change in the perverse incentive</text><text start="5044.32" dur="4.02">landscape of</text><text start="5046.6" dur="3.54">um what will benefit me in the short</text><text start="5048.34" dur="3.6">term even if everyone does that causes</text><text start="5050.14" dur="3.72">harm like but if someone else is doing</text><text start="5051.94" dur="5.12">it how do I get out of it it also</text><text start="5053.86" dur="3.2">requires just</text><text start="5057.159" dur="3.321">at a personal level</text><text start="5060.699" dur="5.221">like taking your own</text><text start="5062.86" dur="5.46">choices more seriously</text><text start="5065.92" dur="4.38">like taking more responsibility for the</text><text start="5068.32" dur="3.54">meaningfulness of your life</text><text start="5070.3" dur="3.18">that&apos;s not a good enough answer at a</text><text start="5071.86" dur="2.94">public level at a public level trying to</text><text start="5073.48" dur="3.12">solved this problem already right like</text><text start="5074.8" dur="4.379">they solved it like that</text><text start="5076.6" dur="4.74">and then it was scary and awesome right</text><text start="5079.179" dur="4.98">they saw all the social media issues so</text><text start="5081.34" dur="5.28">they just banned tick tock their version</text><text start="5084.159" dur="4.261">of tick tock they made the version that</text><text start="5086.62" dur="3.42">was allowed to only play between certain</text><text start="5088.42" dur="3.6">hours so kids wouldn&apos;t stay up at night</text><text start="5090.04" dur="3.78">and it only now for kids produces</text><text start="5092.02" dur="4.139">educational and Museum content and</text><text start="5093.82" dur="3.78">patriotic content they gave their</text><text start="5096.159" dur="3.241">military light phones that don&apos;t even</text><text start="5097.6" dur="3.36">have social media access so they can&apos;t</text><text start="5099.4" dur="4.14">get the people tactical capabilities</text><text start="5100.96" dur="4.44">can&apos;t get polarized they banned video</text><text start="5103.54" dur="3.36">games outside of certain hours whatever</text><text start="5105.4" dur="3.54">and they&apos;re just like oh yeah that&apos;s bad</text><text start="5106.9" dur="3.9">for our population it&apos;s done</text><text start="5108.94" dur="3.48">and that&apos;s where it&apos;s hard to be like</text><text start="5110.8" dur="5.04">okay what kind of political economy we</text><text start="5112.42" dur="5.64">want well we have a market based we we</text><text start="5115.84" dur="3.78">let our markets do technology</text><text start="5118.06" dur="2.76">in a way that we have a very hard time</text><text start="5119.62" dur="4.52">regulating</text><text start="5120.82" dur="5.1">and the Chinese thing sounds kind of</text><text start="5124.14" dur="3.94">paternalistic</text><text start="5125.92" dur="4.44">but it also meant that the kids aren&apos;t</text><text start="5128.08" dur="3.36">all going to get body dysmorphia and</text><text start="5130.36" dur="3.72">it&apos;s not susceptible to</text><text start="5131.44" dur="5.66">population-centric Warfare so I don&apos;t</text><text start="5134.08" dur="6.9">like that answer but I would say</text><text start="5137.1" dur="6.28">the the individual has to be able to</text><text start="5140.98" dur="4.82">compete against the trillion dollar AI</text><text start="5143.38" dur="4.44">empowered multi-billion dollar</text><text start="5145.8" dur="4.3">asymmetric Warfare for your attention</text><text start="5147.82" dur="3.78">it&apos;s just not a good answer at scale and</text><text start="5150.1" dur="2.639">yet for you individually that is the</text><text start="5151.6" dur="2.7">right answer because it&apos;s the thing you</text><text start="5152.739" dur="3.841">have agency over</text><text start="5154.3" dur="4.379">so I know we have to wrap so I think</text><text start="5156.58" dur="3.18">this connects to a closing comment that</text><text start="5158.679" dur="4.101">I have</text><text start="5159.76" dur="3.02">is um</text><text start="5162.88" dur="3.08">all right so I think about</text><text start="5166.84" dur="4.379">I stop and think about</text><text start="5169.0" dur="4.32">AI really is advancing</text><text start="5171.219" dur="3.781">on an exponential curve way faster than</text><text start="5173.32" dur="4.74">Moore&apos;s Law</text><text start="5175.0" dur="5.159">and that means AI drones</text><text start="5178.06" dur="3.36">in they can be produced in basements it</text><text start="5180.159" dur="2.761">can take out infrastructure I think</text><text start="5181.42" dur="3.0">about species Extinction I think about</text><text start="5182.92" dur="4.58">planetary boundaries I think about all</text><text start="5184.42" dur="3.08">these things I&apos;m like</text><text start="5188.38" dur="5.22">and then I gotta go to work</text><text start="5191.08" dur="3.9">or whatever it is or just like stop</text><text start="5193.6" dur="3.68">thinking about it and watch TV or</text><text start="5194.98" dur="2.3">something</text><text start="5201.219" dur="3.901">there are</text><text start="5203.199" dur="3.601">things that can be done some of which</text><text start="5205.12" dur="3.3">are already known and need done much of</text><text start="5206.8" dur="3.48">which need figured out</text><text start="5208.42" dur="2.779">but you&apos;ve got to stay with it</text><text start="5210.28" dur="6.12">right</text><text start="5211.199" dur="8.801">and what I would offer is</text><text start="5216.4" dur="6.0">you like there is a reality of choice</text><text start="5220.0" dur="4.92">in which</text><text start="5222.4" dur="4.14">so I I want to say something that is</text><text start="5224.92" dur="3.6">very much against the simulation</text><text start="5226.54" dur="4.88">hypothesis and against the kind of</text><text start="5228.52" dur="2.9">modern</text><text start="5231.639" dur="6.6">Western Buddhist Maya interpretation</text><text start="5234.54" dur="5.32">that reality is actually real when it&apos;s</text><text start="5238.239" dur="3.361">not an illusion it&apos;s not a simulation it</text><text start="5239.86" dur="3.24">would take me a while to argue why I</text><text start="5241.6" dur="3.24">would say that philosophically but I can</text><text start="5243.1" dur="2.7">do it formally</text><text start="5244.84" dur="2.76">um</text><text start="5245.8" dur="5.04">reality is actually real our</text><text start="5247.6" dur="5.16">understanding of reality in which what</text><text start="5250.84" dur="4.2">is important to me to get ahead and what</text><text start="5252.76" dur="5.28">I think I need to be happy is Maya right</text><text start="5255.04" dur="4.74">as an illusion but the tree&apos;s not an</text><text start="5258.04" dur="4.08">illusion and the kid is not an illusion</text><text start="5259.78" dur="4.26">and if I think this is all illusion then</text><text start="5262.12" dur="3.539">I have no ethical obligation it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="5264.04" dur="3.659">even make sense to help the kid if a car</text><text start="5265.659" dur="5.461">is coming at them or anything else</text><text start="5267.699" dur="5.881">so reality is real and it matters and</text><text start="5271.12" dur="4.079">your choice is not perfect there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="5273.58" dur="3.0">of deterministic factors but there is an</text><text start="5275.199" dur="3.181">element of choice that is real and</text><text start="5276.58" dur="3.84">matters and in that there is</text><text start="5278.38" dur="4.62">meaningfulness to your life and choice</text><text start="5280.42" dur="5.819">and what I would offer is that currently</text><text start="5283.0" dur="6.92">there has never been a time where the</text><text start="5286.239" dur="3.681">choices we make could affect more</text><text start="5290.26" dur="4.919">because I would say that us failing to</text><text start="5293.679" dur="3.121">make it through the meta crisis is</text><text start="5295.179" dur="3.96">totally possible it&apos;s not a given that</text><text start="5296.8" dur="5.399">we make it and us making it is totally</text><text start="5299.139" dur="5.401">possible which means like it&apos;s not</text><text start="5302.199" dur="4.681">determined either way and the choices we</text><text start="5304.54" dur="4.679">make are actually capable of being</text><text start="5306.88" dur="3.359">influential to that and so if I was to</text><text start="5309.219" dur="2.94">leave</text><text start="5310.239" dur="4.5">a final thought on anything it would be</text><text start="5312.159" dur="5.221">if you actually really treated your life</text><text start="5314.739" dur="4.98">like it mattered and that all of your</text><text start="5317.38" dur="4.14">moments had a chance of mattering</text><text start="5319.719" dur="4.141">and they had a chance of mattering not</text><text start="5321.52" dur="4.32">just to you but or even to everybody but</text><text start="5323.86" dur="4.2">to the perpetuity of life&apos;s continuation</text><text start="5325.84" dur="3.6">at this unique time how would you live</text><text start="5328.06"
