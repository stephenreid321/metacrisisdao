how those relate and where we&apos;ll be</text><text start="51.059" dur="8.07">moving forward right so as a result of</text><text start="55.489" dur="6.07">the quarantines and the shutdown

dur="3.66">obviously never seen a negative price on</text><text start="109.29" dur="3.66">oil before and the negative price on oil</text><text start="111.36" dur="3.48">will drive most of the small

dur="6.061">producers but we go from you know during</text><text start="121.5" dur="3.21">the time of the pandemic it&apos;s seeming</text><text start="123.39" dur="2.7">like there was less emissions because</text><text start="124.71" dur="3.57">there were less cars and stuff moving to</text><text start="126.09" dur="4.229">radically dropped prices of oil that</text><text start="128.28"

dur="5.82">unprecedented in the lives of anyone who</text><text start="158.359" dur="5.791">is on this call we also see the very</text><text start="162.139" dur="10.171">strong pressure to start

dur="5.129">information ecology is almost perfectly</text><text start="187.879" dur="5.461">broken like you see just every day I&apos;m</text><text start="190.639" dur="4.35">kind of mind blown of

they work in early</text><text start="202.099" dur="4.081">stage but it&apos;s being said as if it means</text><text start="204.169" dur="4.801">the whole thing and a few of the studies</text><text start="206.18" dur="4.35">even said done within the first 24 to 48</text><text start="208.97" dur="3.12">hours which is very misleading because</text><text start="210.53" dur="3.179">it meant 24 to 48 hours of being</text><text start="212.09" dur="3.479">admitted to the ICU which is already</text><text start="213.709" dur="3.721">late stage but it&apos;s the exact words you</text><text start="215.569" dur="7.32">would use to think of early stage versus</text><text start="217.43" dur="7.709">information warfare and then there&apos;s the</text><text start="222.889" dur="3.421">Santa Clara study of oh it&apos;s not gonna</text><text start="225.139" dur="2.671">be that bad because the background</text><text start="226.31" dur="4.98">levels were already very high but the</text><text start="227.81" dur="4.769">study was just absolute trash it was</text><text start="231.29" dur="3.0">calibrated to have less than five</text><text start="232.579" dur="8.25">percent accuracy of being able to</text><text start="234.29" dur="8.699">identify false negatives so it was</text><text start="240.829" dur="5.701">oriented to about a 20x on the false</text><text start="242.989" dur="5.64">positive side and so we&apos;re making policy</text><text start="246.53" dur="3.479">decisions based on like and it&apos;s</text><text start="248.629" dur="2.94">important to understand that as far as</text><text start="250.009" dur="3.93">the political left and right go in the</text><text start="251.569" dur="5.461">u.s. they&apos;re both just doing information</text><text start="253.939" dur="6.51">warfare through science and then through</text><text start="257.03" dur="7.129">journalism so I have identified pretty</text><text start="260.449" dur="5.911">much no sources of information that</text><text start="264.159" dur="5.29">don&apos;t need further bedding</text><text start="266.36" dur="4.98">and the virus was really just you have</text><text start="269.449" dur="3.421">systemic fragility right we lived in a</text><text start="271.34" dur="3.479">world where we have systemic fragility</text><text start="272.87" dur="4.079">the virus was enough of a hit to that to</text><text start="274.819" dur="3.66">start this cascade of things and what</text><text start="276.949" dur="3.27">happens with the food supply what</text><text start="278.479" dur="3.631">happens with the kind of fourth</text><text start="280.219" dur="3.72">generation hybrid warfare what happens</text><text start="282.11" dur="3.75">with this economic stimulus that&apos;s</text><text start="283.939" dur="3.931">occurring and the fact that there&apos;s no</text><text start="285.86" dur="4.709">economic competition at the very top of</text><text start="287.87" dur="4.59">us and Western finance between the 2008</text><text start="290.569" dur="3.541">big banks and kind of Blackstone and the</text><text start="292.46" dur="9.239">sPB&apos;s that the Treasury is working with</text><text start="294.11" dur="10.47">now we are in a situation where a</text><text start="301.699" dur="4.801">radically different and better world is</text><text start="304.58" dur="9.209">more possible because the existing one</text><text start="306.5" dur="8.4">is more unstable right and it&apos;s</text><text start="313.789" dur="2.551">important to understand that when you</text><text start="314.9" dur="3.419">have an existing system and it becomes</text><text start="316.34" dur="3.509">unstable there&apos;s more possible change</text><text start="318.319" dur="3.9">but it&apos;s more possible change in any</text><text start="319.849" dur="5.451">direction and that&apos;s kind of thing I</text><text start="322.219" dur="5.341">want people to get is that right now</text><text start="325.3" dur="6.549">things are trending in the direction of</text><text start="327.56" dur="7.169">a lot of just super serious</text><text start="331.849" dur="4.74">issues that I don&apos;t know if anybody has</text><text start="334.729" dur="4.711">really prepared I mean nobody could be</text><text start="336.589" dur="6.681">really prepared for it and so I guess</text><text start="339.44" dur="6.33">the thing I want to say is to</text><text start="343.27" dur="4.69">historically we never had fall of</text><text start="345.77" dur="4.139">Empires and transition of power be a</text><text start="347.96" dur="3.419">peaceful thing like that never happened</text><text start="349.909" dur="3.75">as a peaceful easy thing there&apos;s a</text><text start="351.379" dur="5.31">difficult phase from the transition of</text><text start="353.659" dur="6.361">one dominant structure to a new system</text><text start="356.689" dur="5.91">especially a new global medicine so we</text><text start="360.02" dur="4.709">are in a phase where we can hopefully</text><text start="362.599" dur="4.38">avert a lot of the catastrophes and make</text><text start="364.729" dur="4.231">beautiful things happen but that we</text><text start="366.979" dur="4.65">there&apos;s no chance of doing that if you</text><text start="368.96" dur="4.259">don&apos;t actually understand who the very</text><text start="371.629" dur="3.831">powerful players are what they&apos;re</text><text start="373.219" dur="4.771">oriented to do how the systemics works</text><text start="375.46" dur="5.109">so that there&apos;s a kind of positivity</text><text start="377.99" dur="4.979">that&apos;s based on naivete that bugs the</text><text start="380.569" dur="4.261"> out of me because it&apos;s just</text><text start="382.969" dur="4.651">guaranteed to fail and waste human</text><text start="384.83" dur="5.579">effort there&apos;s a kind of positivity that</text><text start="387.62" dur="4.469">says in order to prevent harms and to</text><text start="390.409" dur="4.081">serve the sacred I want to understand</text><text start="392.089" dur="4.62">the harm landscape very well so that I</text><text start="394.49" dur="4.229">can solve all of it and it wants to be</text><text start="396.709" dur="2.851">super sober and clear to be</text><text start="398.719" dur="2.371">empowered to</text><text start="399.56" dur="2.609">actually create positive results rather</text><text start="401.09" dur="5.51">than pretend that they&apos;re already</text><text start="402.169" dur="7.531">happening so I think that would be my</text><text start="406.6" dur="4.9">hope is that people like take their</text><text start="409.7" dur="4.74">celebration at the beauty of life and</text><text start="411.5" dur="4.26">they&apos;re fearing or whatever at the harm</text><text start="414.44" dur="2.699">of life and realize they&apos;re connected</text><text start="415.76" dur="2.76">right there&apos;s a love of life that has</text><text start="417.139" dur="3.151">you want to celebrate it want to be</text><text start="418.52" dur="4.56">hopeful be concerned about it being</text><text start="420.29" dur="5.16">harmed and transition all that into how</text><text start="423.08" dur="4.41">can I understand what I need to</text><text start="425.45" dur="5.87">understand to be effective and how can I</text><text start="427.49" dur="6.33">strengthen and fortify myself to</text><text start="431.32" dur="4.24">continue to be effective of what&apos;s going</text><text start="433.82" dur="4.71">to be very hard work for quite a quite a</text><text start="435.56" dur="3.96">while not a sprint but you know in an</text><text start="438.53" dur="10.859">ultramarathon</text><text start="439.52" dur="19.83">of intense work for some time Daniel</text><text start="449.389" dur="12.121">thank you to us beyond your years we</text><text start="459.35" dur="4.29">speak for the community and how much we</text><text start="461.51" dur="4.89">all respect and appreciate your deep</text><text start="463.64" dur="5.67">dedication and the integrity with which</text><text start="466.4" dur="6.66">you hold it these are the most critical</text><text start="469.31" dur="5.87">challenges of our time so maybe just</text><text start="473.06" dur="5.25">that one quick closing question is</text><text start="475.18" dur="4.9">what&apos;s your recommendation for us as a</text><text start="478.31" dur="3.169">community that the people you&apos;re</text><text start="480.08" dur="4.589">speaking to today</text><text start="481.479" dur="4.631">what can we do together that you you</text><text start="484.669" dur="7.5">know what would be your kind of</text><text start="486.11" dur="7.79">invitation right now not everybody has</text><text start="492.169" dur="3.961">to understand what&apos;s happening with</text><text start="493.9" dur="4.36">financial warfare and information</text><text start="496.13" dur="4.17">warfare and cyber warfare to like that&apos;s</text><text start="498.26" dur="3.33">not what everyone&apos;s is going to be</text><text start="500.3" dur="3.3">there&apos;s gonna be a lot of people where</text><text start="501.59" dur="5.449">it&apos;s like what is yours to do is to</text><text start="503.6" dur="5.55">check in on the older people who are</text><text start="507.039" dur="3.431">lonelier and more fragile and more</text><text start="509.15" dur="2.4"> up in your communities than</text><text start="510.47" dur="5.879">they&apos;ve already been and they were</text><text start="511.55" dur="6.359">already very fragile and and so the info</text><text start="516.349" dur="4.411">that you need for the kind of agency</text><text start="517.909" dur="7.05">that is yours is the network map of</text><text start="520.76" dur="5.82">who&apos;s vulnerable right and so I&apos;m not</text><text start="524.959" dur="2.821">saying that everyone should try to be</text><text start="526.58" dur="3.29">informed in things that are not</text><text start="527.78" dur="4.98">necessarily what is theirs to act on</text><text start="529.87" dur="3.44">so getting having some clarity of like</text><text start="532.76" dur="4.0">where you</text><text start="533.31" dur="12.33">feel that you can contribute and how</text><text start="536.76" dur="11.4">best to do that and as far as people</text><text start="545.64" dur="3.99">want to be involved in some of the</text><text start="548.16" dur="3.03">things that I know that a number of</text><text start="549.63" dur="3.959">people in here want to which is kind of</text><text start="551.19" dur="5.7">systemic change or change of the</text><text start="553.589" dur="7.5">underlying infrastructure culture</text><text start="556.89" dur="7.74">politics economics you you can&apos;t solve</text><text start="561.089" dur="5.641">problems you don&apos;t understand and you</text><text start="564.63" dur="3.27">can&apos;t create solutions in a space where</text><text start="566.73" dur="4.95">you don&apos;t understand what&apos;s already</text><text start="567.9" dur="6.0">influencing that space and so I would</text><text start="571.68" dur="4.25">say just deepen the commitment to what</text><text start="573.9" dur="5.64">it takes to be effective and it&apos;s like</text><text start="575.93" dur="5.77">there&apos;s a lot of things I&apos;m I might want</text><text start="579.54" dur="3.84">to do but I just don&apos;t I just can&apos;t pick</text><text start="581.7" dur="3.27">up a guitar and shred like Jimi Hendrix</text><text start="583.38" dur="6.48">if I wanted to enough I&apos;d have to train</text><text start="584.97" dur="6.27">a lot right and and so if I want to</text><text start="589.86" dur="3.12">enough I&apos;ll train a lot the same thing</text><text start="591.24" dur="3.48">if I want to understand what&apos;s going on</text><text start="592.98" dur="3.51">enough to have a perspective that&apos;s</text><text start="594.72" dur="3.69">worth anything to contribute I&apos;m gonna</text><text start="596.49" dur="3.75">have to train at understanding what&apos;s</text><text start="598.41" dur="5.27">going on quite a lot and otherwise I&apos;ll</text><text start="600.24" dur="3.44">probably be wrong about most of it and</text><text start="604.16" dur="8.679">so yeah I would just like to encourage</text><text start="608.6" dur="6.85">some depth of commitment and kind of</text><text start="612.839" dur="4.591">reality check around that so that so</text><text start="615.45" dur="8.22">that the feeling hopeful is actually</text><text start="617.43" dur="7.77">based on something real wait there&apos;s one</text><text start="623.67" dur="3.66">more thing</text><text start="625.2" dur="3.9">one of the definitions of sociopathy is</text><text start="627.33" dur="4.17">actually an inability to feel certain</text><text start="629.1" dur="4.47">negative emotions if you don&apos;t feel</text><text start="631.5" dur="5.16">shame and guilt and remorse you can hurt</text><text start="633.57" dur="5.04">other people all of the spiritual ideals</text><text start="636.66" dur="3.45">that have you orient to just wanting to</text><text start="638.61" dur="3.36">be kind of happy and hopeful and stoked</text><text start="640.11" dur="6.75">all the time make you kind of a</text><text start="641.97" dur="7.739">sociopath and so if the world is hurting</text><text start="646.86" dur="5.07">in you&apos;re stoked you you know like</text><text start="649.709" dur="4.5">there&apos;s something wrong with you it&apos;s</text><text start="651.93" dur="3.599">important that you can actually feel</text><text start="654.209" dur="3.0">what&apos;s going on it&apos;s also important that</text><text start="655.529" dur="4.441">you can say man I failed I worked my ass</text><text start="657.209" dur="4.261">off and I failed so I can learn if I</text><text start="659.97" dur="3.03">can&apos;t admit that I failed I can never</text><text start="661.47" dur="4.11">learn what didn&apos;t work to do a better</text><text start="663.0" dur="3.69">job so I want to acknowledge whenever</text><text start="665.58" dur="3.3">I&apos;m doing something that&apos;s working</text><text start="666.69" dur="4.95">well and when it&apos;s failing not so that I</text><text start="668.88" dur="5.76">can just be down on myself uselessly but</text><text start="671.64" dur="4.92">so that I can learn so I both want to</text><text start="674.64" dur="2.88">acknowledge success and failure I want</text><text start="676.56" dur="2.31">to acknowledge things that are going</text><text start="677.52" dur="3.27">well and things that aren&apos;t going well</text><text start="678.87" dur="3.75">and I want to
