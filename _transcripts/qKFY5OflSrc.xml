of</text><text start="5.339" dur="6.211">the reactionary simplistic takes on it</text><text start="7.44" dur="6.89">are part of the problem so let&apos;s explore</text><text start="11.55" dur="6.36">this nuance alright cool so let&apos;s take</text><text start="14.33" dur="5.44">em the issue of race okay which is right</text><text start="17.91" dur="3.449">at the heart of that topic we can look</text><text start="19.77" dur="4.98">at race we can look at gender we can</text><text start="21.359" dur="5.25">look at transgender LGBTQ we can look at</text><text start="24.75" dur="4.56">any of those dynamics that are part of</text><text start="26.609" dur="6.021">the the identity politics part of you</text><text start="29.31" dur="6.179">learning up right now this is related to</text><text start="32.63" dur="4.24">post-modernism and it derives some of</text><text start="35.489" dur="2.941">its intellectual basis from</text><text start="36.87" dur="4.02">post-modernism but it&apos;s also related to</text><text start="38.43" dur="4.23">some other key things so if we look at</text><text start="40.89" dur="9.78">race and we look at black lives matter</text><text start="42.66" dur="11.01">or people&apos;s color movement or etc we</text><text start="50.67" dur="7.38">have not ever properly dealt with the</text><text start="53.67" dur="6.33">fact that this country was that this</text><text start="58.05" dur="4.41">land that we call this country was fully</text><text start="60.0" dur="6.39">inhabited by lots of nations of people</text><text start="62.46" dur="7.17">that we completely scarred to make this</text><text start="66.39" dur="4.86">land right it was we&apos;re gonna we&apos;re</text><text start="69.63" dur="3.54">getting taxation without representation</text><text start="71.25" dur="3.27">in London we don&apos;t want to be here</text><text start="73.17" dur="2.879">anymore so we&apos;re gonna go somewhere else</text><text start="74.52" dur="3.18">and hey look there&apos;s a whole continent</text><text start="76.049" dur="3.271">that&apos;s totally free because we have</text><text start="77.7" dur="3.45">better military than equipment than they</text><text start="79.32" dur="4.979">do so we can kill all those people and</text><text start="81.15" dur="5.07">take the whole land there&apos;s a real moral</text><text start="84.299" dur="3.36"> problem - having your moral</text><text start="86.22" dur="2.85">legitimacy as the United States of</text><text start="87.659" dur="2.701">America in the beautiful Constitution</text><text start="89.07" dur="4.08">Declaration of Independence being based</text><text start="90.36" dur="5.549">on genocide and we&apos;re pretty happy to</text><text start="93.15" dur="4.35">acknowledge like after Germany&apos;s</text><text start="95.909" dur="3.96">genocide they&apos;re up right there&apos;s</text><text start="97.5" dur="4.14">a whole cultural thing but our genocide</text><text start="99.869" dur="4.89">was not that long before and it was more</text><text start="101.64" dur="5.85">people there was a lot more people wow</text><text start="104.759" dur="5.091">that&apos;s interesting and it was the</text><text start="107.49" dur="4.8">genocide of the Native American people</text><text start="109.85" dur="5.26">employing the slavery of the Africans</text><text start="112.29" dur="4.89">and we mean real slavery like</text><text start="115.11" dur="3.84">captured the people by military force</text><text start="117.18" dur="5.49">killed lots of them tortured and killed</text><text start="118.95" dur="5.64">lots of them lynching etc and we like we</text><text start="122.67" dur="4.17">don&apos;t want to really acknowledge that</text><text start="124.59" dur="3.539">this country was built with that it was</text><text start="126.84" dur="3.71">built with a pretty decent amount of</text><text start="128.129" dur="9.591">Chinese slavery a lot of African slavery</text><text start="130.55" dur="10.59">and one major genocide alright so then</text><text start="137.72" dur="4.83">we&apos;ve got you know we have to fight a</text><text start="141.14" dur="3.87">war to finally get rid of slavery not</text><text start="142.55" dur="4.26">that long ago like really not that long</text><text start="145.01" dur="3.87">ago where there are old people alive</text><text start="146.81" dur="4.95">today that still remember elements of</text><text start="148.88" dur="6.18">slavery dynamics right like that&apos;s a big</text><text start="151.76" dur="5.22">deal to get but then okay so we abolish</text><text start="155.06" dur="3.42">slavery without abolishing the mindset</text><text start="156.98" dur="2.58">that was associated with it so a lot of</text><text start="158.48" dur="2.82">people didn&apos;t want to go on so then</text><text start="159.56" dur="6.18">we&apos;ve got Jim Crow and segregation and</text><text start="161.3" dur="7.59">all that and then we kinda overturned</text><text start="165.74" dur="5.13">that kinda right but slaves actually</text><text start="168.89" dur="3.54">economically work really well it&apos;s kind</text><text start="170.87" dur="3.03">of nice to be able to have people do all</text><text start="172.43" dur="2.94">the work and not get paid and be</text><text start="173.9" dur="2.97">able to concentrate the profit margins</text><text start="175.37" dur="2.97">and as soon as you don&apos;t want to do that</text><text start="176.87" dur="3.15">with the slaves now people gotta take</text><text start="178.34" dur="3.03">you know other people have to take the</text><text start="180.02" dur="3.06"> jobs and who wants the jobs</text><text start="181.37" dur="3.93">and then you have to dilute the profit</text><text start="183.08" dur="3.24">margin to pay minimum wages so there&apos;s a</text><text start="185.3" dur="4.44">lot of people that just didn&apos;t like that</text><text start="186.32" dur="6.93">right for legit legit understandable</text><text start="189.74" dur="5.07">reasons and they could justify making</text><text start="193.25" dur="3.45">another group of people different enough</text><text start="194.81" dur="5.49">that slavery was better than their own</text><text start="196.7" dur="5.759">sacrifice in that zero sum game dynamic</text><text start="200.3" dur="8.1">right or near zero-sum games anyway and</text><text start="202.459" dur="7.801">then we have okay so now it&apos;s not full</text><text start="208.4" dur="3.27">segregation legally but that mindset</text><text start="210.26" dur="3.5">still there and the people who are</text><text start="211.67" dur="4.17">coming out of segregation have</text><text start="213.76" dur="5.17">generations of trauma and no education</text><text start="215.84" dur="4.05">and no inheritance right well as opposed</text><text start="218.93" dur="3.0">to people who are coming from</text><text start="219.89" dur="3.99">generations of Education inheritance and</text><text start="221.93" dur="4.62">not the same types of trauma so we have</text><text start="223.88" dur="4.62">the ghetto phenomena and what that means</text><text start="226.55" dur="3.78">and we we know how epigenetic trauma</text><text start="228.5" dur="5.19">works now generationally right we know</text><text start="230.33" dur="5.51">how mimetic trauma works and so then we</text><text start="233.69" dur="5.82">look at do we still have a system of</text><text start="235.84" dur="5.26">systemic injustice yes we still</text><text start="239.51" dur="3.39">have a system of systemic injustice and</text><text start="241.1" dur="3.78">anyway person who wouldn&apos;t just trade to</text><text start="242.9" dur="3.51">be black recognizes that the ethics of</text><text start="244.88" dur="3.99">the pie slice they&apos;re a menthe in place</text><text start="246.41" dur="5.31">right pie slice theorem is if it&apos;s just</text><text start="248.87" dur="4.83">there&apos;s a symmetry right between you and</text><text start="251.72" dur="3.299">I which is all cut the slice of pie and</text><text start="253.7" dur="3.87">you get a pic which side but I don&apos;t get</text><text start="255.019" dur="3.871">a cut and pick right if I could end pic</text><text start="257.57" dur="3.39">there some up or you can cut an</text><text start="258.89" dur="3.57">all pic but anyone who says I wouldn&apos;t</text><text start="260.96" dur="2.53">want to trade positions with the other</text><text start="262.46" dur="3.22">person that they should be fine</text><text start="263.49" dur="4.59">with it there&apos;s a problem and that&apos;s</text><text start="265.68" dur="4.769">that&apos;s the dynamic here so there is a</text><text start="268.08" dur="5.04">real response to unresolved trauma that</text><text start="270.449" dur="4.951">is still affecting things now that said</text><text start="273.12" dur="5.13">the response is coming from a place that</text><text start="275.4" dur="5.19">is largely influenced by trauma rather</text><text start="278.25" dur="5.13">than clear strategy and trauma usually</text><text start="280.59" dur="4.049">perpetuates itself and so if a bunch of</text><text start="283.38" dur="5.129">people with black lives matter is saying</text><text start="284.639" dur="5.731">hey there are real issues where where</text><text start="288.509" dur="4.951">there are a lot of black people who are</text><text start="290.37" dur="5.19">getting killed by police for reasons</text><text start="293.46" dur="3.72">that are totally unfounded and then not</text><text start="295.56" dur="2.759">getting prosecuted in the same way not</text><text start="297.18" dur="3.359">getting attention in the same way like</text><text start="298.319" dur="4.141">that&apos;s a real deal and how does anyone</text><text start="300.539" dur="4.051">go about trying to go to school and feel</text><text start="302.46" dur="4.29">safe when you can be going to school</text><text start="304.59" dur="5.04">doing all the right things and have that</text><text start="306.75" dur="5.28">kind of dynamic occur all right so then</text><text start="309.63" dur="5.73">they go shut down a freeway out of like</text><text start="312.03" dur="4.77">upset and anger whatever and then while</text><text start="315.36" dur="3.589">that&apos;s trying to get attention for</text><text start="316.8" dur="4.769">something that is real it is</text><text start="318.949" dur="5.94">strategically problematic right because</text><text start="321.569" dur="6.09">then you have the alright largely</text><text start="324.889" dur="5.65">arising as a response to those type of</text><text start="327.659" dur="5.121">dynamics saying look our way of life</text><text start="330.539" dur="5.641">that we care abouts being threatened and</text><text start="332.78" dur="5.229">look these people are rioting and</text><text start="336.18" dur="4.049">causing chaos and whatever they&apos;re</text><text start="338.009" dur="5.13">validating our ideas about them not</text><text start="340.229" dur="6.361">being strategic good thinkers etc and so</text><text start="343.139" dur="5.37">and because of a postmodern dynamic that</text><text start="346.59" dur="3.69">in general the progressive left has it</text><text start="348.509" dur="3.78">makes it harder for them to cohere</text><text start="350.28" dur="3.84">because they want to validate everyone&apos;s</text><text start="352.289" dur="3.93">perspective because they&apos;re suffering</text><text start="354.12" dur="3.87">they&apos;re still in response to the pain of</text><text start="356.219" dur="4.051">imperialism or one in perspective is</text><text start="357.99" dur="3.75">imposed on everyone so part of the</text><text start="360.27" dur="2.76">response is to say hey everybody</text><text start="361.74" dur="2.609">actually has a perspective and the</text><text start="363.03" dur="3.33">perspective that you&apos;re saying is just</text><text start="364.349" dur="3.81">true cuz it&apos;s science or whatever a lot</text><text start="366.36" dur="3.54">of our social science that arose at the</text><text start="368.159" dur="4.111">same time as our physical science was</text><text start="369.9" dur="5.43">actually just imperialism and so</text><text start="372.27" dur="4.73">post-modernism emerged amongst I&apos;m</text><text start="375.33" dur="4.8">radically simplifying here</text><text start="377.0" dur="5.83">post-modernism emerged with a partial</text><text start="380.13" dur="5.009">meaningful truth which was to say this</text><text start="382.83" dur="3.6">is just objectively true this is science</text><text start="385.139" dur="2.37">we did the right epistemology</text><text start="386.43" dur="3.09">subjectively true and it&apos;s true for</text><text start="387.509" dur="3.571">everybody doesn&apos;t acknowledge that</text><text start="389.52" dur="3.03">especially as we get into the social</text><text start="391.08" dur="5.16">sciences there&apos;s a ton of bias</text><text start="392.55" dur="4.77">right and so we you know we went looking</text><text start="396.24" dur="2.46">for menage</text><text start="397.32" dur="3.87">me and pair-bonding in the animal</text><text start="398.7" dur="4.25">kingdom because of Victorian age ideas</text><text start="401.19" dur="4.77">that actually made us do</text><text start="402.95" dur="4.27">zoology badly right and so we&apos;d like we</text><text start="405.96" dur="2.85">see that kind of thing everywhere so</text><text start="407.22" dur="3.72">post Martin said actually different</text><text start="408.81" dur="3.57">perspectives on reality running</text><text start="410.94" dur="3.15">different experiments end up yielding</text><text start="412.38" dur="4.38">different kind of insights and we still</text><text start="414.09" dur="4.53">know that are you healthiest on a vegan</text><text start="416.76" dur="3.96">diet or a paleo diet I can show you just</text><text start="418.62" dur="3.69">as much research on both of</text><text start="420.72" dur="4.38">those that look at different metrics</text><text start="422.31" dur="5.55">right and so whether I&apos;m looking at pH</text><text start="425.1" dur="4.62">or I&apos;m looking at insulin levels or I&apos;m</text><text start="427.86" dur="3.39">looking at telomere levels like I&apos;ll get</text><text start="429.72" dur="3.87">different answers and also which</text><text start="431.25" dur="4.59">populations but when I try and reduce</text><text start="433.59" dur="3.72">health to some finite set of metrics and</text><text start="435.84" dur="3.9">there&apos;s a million metrics that</text><text start="437.31" dur="4.86">we can&apos;t calculate I can get a lot of</text><text start="439.74" dur="4.62">partial answers that seem like the whole</text><text start="442.17" dur="3.36">answer and seem like complete science</text><text start="444.36" dur="3.75">because I&apos;m studying a very complex</text><text start="445.53" dur="3.87">system a very simplistic way so bias is</text><text start="448.11" dur="2.49">very easy when you trying to set a</text><text start="449.4" dur="2.64">complex system in a simple way because</text><text start="450.6" dur="2.43">your metrics look really clear</text><text start="452.04" dur="3.35">that they just don&apos;t happen to be all</text><text start="453.03" dur="4.23">the metrics that matter and so</text><text start="455.39" dur="3.58">post-modernism acknowledged that and</text><text start="457.26" dur="5.79">said hey all the perspectives actually</text><text start="458.97" dur="6.78">have to be factored now there was a kind</text><text start="463.05" dur="6.69">of virulent version of that that didn&apos;t</text><text start="465.75" dur="5.04">acknowledge there all the perspectives</text><text start="469.74" dur="2.76">should be acknowledged but they&apos;re not</text><text start="470.79" dur="3.21">all going to be equally true some of</text><text start="472.5" dur="3.0">them can have distortion in them so we</text><text start="474.0" dur="3.87">need to be able to bet for distortion</text><text start="475.5" dur="5.09">and all the perspectives are going to be</text><text start="477.87" dur="5.58">less different in simpler systems so in</text><text start="480.59" dur="4.18">chemistry the epistemology is more</text><text start="483.45" dur="3.24">straightforward than it is in social</text><text start="484.77" dur="3.9">sciences and some of the virulent</text><text start="486.69" dur="4.41">version of post-modernism just start</text><text start="488.67" dur="4.59">rejecting truth writ large right like</text><text start="491.1" dur="4.68">any claim of truth as a cliff as an</text><text start="493.26" dur="4.62">imperialist claim and nobody can claim</text><text start="495.78" dur="5.25">truth and all perspectives are equally</text><text start="497.88" dur="5.31">true and but we can see that that was a</text><text start="501.03" dur="4.95">virulent version of an appropriate</text><text start="503.19" dur="6.57">response or a to Avery the way that</text><text start="505.98" dur="6.33">science imperialism capitalism along</text><text start="509.76" dur="4.95">with fucking&apos;s like you know colonialism</text><text start="512.31" dur="4.59">make all kind of Co emerged and trying</text><text start="514.71" dur="3.329">to untangle those was like part of the</text><text start="516.9" dur="3.63">goal there so if you actually read</text><text start="518.039" dur="4.261">Foucault or dare at all there&apos;s a</text><text start="520.53" dur="3.78">meaningful good thinking in there</text><text start="522.3" dur="4.2">most of what you see happening that</text><text start="524.31" dur="3.96">tries to intellectually reify itself</text><text start="526.5" dur="3.54">with those people is not actually being</text><text start="528.27" dur="3.36">done very well but that&apos;s because trauma</text><text start="530.04" dur="2.88">is influencing a lot of it</text><text start="531.63" dur="3.15">then on the other side we&apos;ve never</text><text start="532.92" dur="5.46">actually taken responsibility to deal</text><text start="534.78" dur="6.18">with that that trauma was created so</text><text start="538.38" dur="5.12">when I say it&apos;s nuanced it is and it&apos;s a</text><text start="540.96" dur="5.43">really big deal because if we look at</text><text start="543.5" dur="6.01">the all the alt-right and the control</text><text start="546.39" dur="5.28">left they have moved to a level of</text><text start="549.51" dur="4.22">polarization and radicalization that is</text><text start="551.67" dur="5.91">very hard to imagine how that reconciles</text><text start="553.73" dur="7.86">and with a tremendous amount of feel on</text><text start="557.58" dur="6.78">both sides and trauma on both sides and</text><text start="561.59" dur="4.96">associated with that the desire for</text><text start="564.36" dur="3.99">secession from the nation the desire for</text><text start="566.55" dur="3.66">whatever that leads to war in a world</text><text start="568.35" dur="3.03">where military technology assets that we</text><text start="570.21" dur="3.03">don&apos;t get to make it through Wars so we</text><text start="571.38" dur="3.06">did in the past and so the idea hey look</text><text start="573.24" dur="2.67">we thought a war with the British to</text><text start="574.44" dur="4.35">come get this area and it worked well</text><text start="575.91" dur="5.64">yeah we have muskets right and</text><text start="578.79" dur="4.86">as the military technology goes up it</text><text start="581.55" dur="4.22">becomes more and more problematic and</text><text start="583.65" dur="5.39">when we get to the level where you have</text><text start="585.77" dur="6.16">decentralized exponential technology</text><text start="589.04" dur="4.03">which is where we&apos;re at right now we</text><text start="591.93" dur="5.4">don&apos;t get to make it through Wars</text><text start="593.07" dur="5.55">anymore and humanity has always had</text><text start="597.33" dur="3.21">different dynamics that led us to</text><text start="598.62" dur="3.24">polarization and radicalization and then</text><text start="600.54" dur="2.97">war and we have to actually learn how to</text><text start="601.86" dur="3.75"> deal with that and part of it is</text><text start="603.51" dur="4.04">we have to be able to understand how to</text><text start="605.61" dur="5.33">take multiple perspectives</text><text start="607.55" dur="6.34">they have partial truth that they&apos;re not</text><text start="610.94" dur="4.18">successful parts you know find the</text><text start="613.89" dur="4.11">successful parts and figure out how to</text><text start="615.12" dur="4.38">do dialectic how to do
