brain does continuously produce</text><text start="149.44" dur="5.18">neural stem cells most in the</text><text start="151.69" dur="5.25">hippocampus that then differentiate into</text><text start="154.62" dur="5.49">you know other regions of the brain</text><text start="156.94" dur="5.64">other tissues and that that rate of</text><text start="160.11" dur="4.06">neural stem cell production can be</text><text start="162.58" dur="4.23">increased or decreased by a number of</text><text start="164.17" dur="6.21">factors so when we think about brain</text><text start="166.81" dur="5.61">aging and also neurogenesis isn&apos;t just</text><text start="170.38" dur="4.35">for brain aging it&apos;s also for dealing</text><text start="172.42" dur="4.95">with traumatic brain

research on our team just</text><text start="193.359" dur="4.141">wrote a meta-analysis of all of the</text><text start="195.67" dur="3.83">research done on addled neurogenesis and</text><text start="197.5" dur="5.79">we&apos;ll be publishing it soon and it is</text><text start="199.5" dur="5.92">it&apos;s fascinating and our hypothesis from</text><text start="203.29" dur="5.729">evolutionary biology perspective is that</text><text start="205.42" dur="5.939">when you think about human genetics and</text><text start="209.019" dur="4.611">what they selected for more than</text><text start="211.359" dur="4.561">anything they selected for this is a</text><text start="213.63" dur="5.5">generalized but fair way to say it</text><text start="215.92" dur="6.18">they selected for neurogenesis you know</text><text start="219.13" dur="5.57">our genes selected for memes right they</text><text start="222.1" dur="5.52">selected for a creature that could</text><text start="224.7" dur="4.509">change themselves and their basis for</text><text start="227.62" dur="3.6">acting over the course of their life</text><text start="229.209" dur="4.581">significantly in one generation to the</text><text start="231.22" dur="7.56">next faster than genes could change and</text><text start="233.79" dur="7.81">so most animals their behavior is pretty</text><text start="238.78" dur="4.5">genetically hardwired and modulated by</text><text start="241.6" dur="3.99">the environments a little which is why</text><text start="243.28" dur="3.96">they actually have the hardwired code to</text><text start="245.59" dur="3.21">like get up and walk</text><text start="247.24" dur="5.19">do stuff in the first few minutes of</text><text start="248.8" dur="5.97">life and we are jnanis and basically</text><text start="252.43" dur="3.98">useless for so long right for a year and</text><text start="254.77" dur="5.12">a half we can do hardly anything and</text><text start="256.41" dur="6.79">it&apos;s because we&apos;re very soft wired</text><text start="259.89" dur="6.07">because as tool makers that modify our</text><text start="263.2" dur="5.52">own environment think about like the</text><text start="265.96" dur="4.2">most adaptive person 10,000 years ago at</text><text start="268.72" dur="2.7">spear-throwing would be useless today</text><text start="270.16" dur="2.31">because they couldn&apos;t text and they</text><text start="271.42" dur="3.33">couldn&apos;t type and they wouldn&apos;t know how</text><text start="272.47" dur="4.86">to call uber and and so it&apos;s very</text><text start="274.75" dur="4.47">important that as we are modifying the</text><text start="277.33" dur="3.81">environment we can adapt to our new</text><text start="279.22" dur="3.69">modified environments which means that</text><text start="281.14" dur="4.65">we are not hardwired that we can be</text><text start="282.91" dur="6.21">rewiring our innate processes right and</text><text start="285.79" dur="5.66">neurogenesis is a major part of that so</text><text start="289.12" dur="6.45">it&apos;s a super fascinating field for</text><text start="291.45" dur="6.58">disease recovery for anti-aging for</text><text start="295.57" dur="5.76">understanding human nature and for kind</text><text start="298.03" dur="4.17">of hyper learning and capabilities so</text><text start="301.33" dur="2.85">there&apos;s a bunch of things that affect</text><text start="302.2" dur="4.43">neurogenesis there are these chemicals</text><text start="304.18" dur="2.45">called neurotransmitters</text><text start="308.16" dur="6.64">BDNF is the most well understood one</text><text start="311.83" dur="5.25">brain drive neurotrophic factor ng F for</text><text start="314.8" dur="6.83">nerve growth factor so there are things</text><text start="317.08" dur="7.26">that can increase BDNF increase NGS and</text><text start="321.63" dur="4.0">normal lifestyle things like exercise is</text><text start="324.34" dur="2.61">one of the ones that we know better than</text><text start="325.63" dur="4.14">anything that actually increases</text><text start="326.95" dur="4.62">neurogenesis weight lifting and hit</text><text start="329.77" dur="5.13">training in particular more than</text><text start="331.57" dur="6.63">aerobics are very BDNF up regulating</text><text start="334.9" dur="4.77">sleep is BDNF up regulating and lack of</text><text start="338.2" dur="3.36">sleep ins of meaning decrease</text><text start="339.67" dur="3.87">neurogenesis there are a number of</text><text start="341.56" dur="5.43">nutrients that are also involved and</text><text start="343.54" dur="5.58">there are some herbs and mushrooms that</text><text start="346.99" dur="5.25">have very very potent effects so you</text><text start="349.12" dur="4.77">know lion&apos;s mane has been used for nerve</text><text start="352.24" dur="5.61">injury for a long time and it happens to</text><text start="353.89" dur="5.49">very acutely elevate ngf levels some key</text><text start="357.85" dur="3.99">nutrients like methylcobalamin</text><text start="359.38" dur="5.31">methylated coma b12 and taurine in</text><text start="361.84" dur="5.94">fairly high doses up regulate the</text><text start="364.69" dur="5.73">endogenous rate of neurogenesis then</text><text start="367.78" dur="4.71">there are some drugs that are being</text><text start="370.42" dur="4.05">developed forward neurogenic purposes</text><text start="372.49" dur="3.66">and I actually think this is one of the</text><text start="374.47" dur="3.78">most brilliant things a drug could do</text><text start="376.15" dur="4.389">you know I said some things that sounded</text><text start="378.25" dur="4.28">like they were negative regarding</text><text start="380.539" dur="4.0">pharmaceutical approach as a whole</text><text start="382.53" dur="3.63">earlier I want to say that some very</text><text start="384.539" dur="3.301">meaningfully positive things are</text><text start="386.16" dur="3.629">happening in all branches of</text><text start="387.84" dur="5.49">pharmaceuticals largely because other</text><text start="389.789" dur="6.151">areas especially in complex disease are</text><text start="393.33" dur="4.7">failing so that what&apos;s the cool new</text><text start="395.94" dur="5.009">areas that are happening is not just a</text><text start="398.03" dur="5.319">chemical that will try and change the</text><text start="400.949" dur="4.5">level of something but a drug that will</text><text start="403.349" dur="4.231">actually support the body&apos;s ability to</text><text start="405.449" dur="3.991">do something better so that I can make</text><text start="407.58" dur="5.51">this point well think about a statin</text><text start="409.44" dur="6.75">right for cholesterol if your</text><text start="413.09" dur="5.5">cholesterol is high and we give you a</text><text start="416.19" dur="3.599">statin to lower it we don&apos;t know why</text><text start="418.59" dur="2.85">your cholesterol is high your</text><text start="419.789" dur="4.44">cholesterol can be high because of diet</text><text start="421.44" dur="4.199">it can be high because of diabetes like</text><text start="424.229" dur="4.381">things it can be high because of mold</text><text start="425.639" dur="5.551">toxicity and so just lowering it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="428.61" dur="4.83">actually address the pathology or the</text><text start="431.19" dur="3.39">behavior that whatever so that kind of</text><text start="433.44" dur="4.379">drug approach is not that interesting</text><text start="434.58" dur="4.769">and very interestingly sometimes the</text><text start="437.819" dur="3.0">opposite is what needs to happen so we</text><text start="439.349" dur="2.85">can you know if your blood pressure&apos;s</text><text start="440.819" dur="3.9">high we give you a drug to just lower</text><text start="442.199" dur="4.411">your blood pressure all right you just</text><text start="444.719" dur="3.6">exogenous lis lower blood pressure but</text><text start="446.61" dur="4.23">why had the body been setting that point</text><text start="448.319" dur="4.921">too high to begin with if you exercise</text><text start="450.84" dur="4.139">the reason that exercise lowers blood</text><text start="453.24" dur="4.049">pressure is because when you exercise it</text><text start="454.979" dur="4.351">raises your blood pressure and when the</text><text start="457.289" dur="3.93">blood pressure spikes even higher it</text><text start="459.33" dur="3.899">actually kicks in the hormetic</text><text start="461.219" dur="4.29">mechanisms hormesis is the body&apos;s</text><text start="463.229" dur="3.571">response to stress it kicks in the</text><text start="465.509" dur="2.491">hormetic mechanism for the body to say</text><text start="466.8" dur="2.91">oh the blood pressures too high let&apos;s</text><text start="468.0" dur="3.21">bring it down on our own and the body</text><text start="469.71" dur="4.29">starts regulating blood pressure better</text><text start="471.21" dur="5.429">but it actually rather than externally</text><text start="474.0" dur="4.949">moving it lower what it needed was to be</text><text start="476.639" dur="5.191">moved higher and then it and its own</text><text start="478.949" dur="4.681">self-regulation occurred so drugs that</text><text start="481.83" dur="4.53">just try and move something into range</text><text start="483.63" dur="4.5">without asking why it happened and</text><text start="486.36" dur="3.839">without increasing the body&apos;s ability to</text><text start="488.13" dur="3.3">maintain that range not so interesting</text><text start="490.199" dur="2.701">to me even though I mean they&apos;re</text><text start="491.43" dur="3.9">life-saving they&apos;re just not adequate</text><text start="492.9" dur="4.139">solutions as we move forward but as we</text><text start="495.33" dur="4.73">move from like the chemo therapeutic</text><text start="497.039" dur="5.641">approaches to cancer to amino oncology</text><text start="500.06" dur="4.539">immuno oncology is the beginning of us</text><text start="502.68" dur="3.329">doing anything with cancer that&apos;s really</text><text start="504.599" dur="3.57">interesting where we&apos;re actually</text><text start="506.009" dur="4.371">training the body&apos;s immune systems</text><text start="508.169" dur="5.91">capacity to kill cancer cells better</text><text start="510.38" dur="3.97">that&apos;s actually pretty great well in the</text><text start="514.079" dur="2.611">neural</text><text start="514.35" dur="6.12">logic space there&apos;s a company called</text><text start="516.69" dur="5.64">neural stem they&apos;re working on a drug</text><text start="520.47" dur="5.34">there and I believe face two clinical</text><text start="522.33" dur="5.84">trials right now called NS I 189 and it</text><text start="525.81" dur="5.43">was originally being developed for ALS</text><text start="528.17" dur="4.18">but now I believe that the first thing</text><text start="531.24" dur="4.14">that are trying to improve it for his</text><text start="532.35" dur="4.89">major depressive disorder but it for ALS</text><text start="535.38" dur="3.45">they were originally working with neural</text><text start="537.24" dur="3.15">stem cells they would grow neural stem</text><text start="538.83" dur="3.96">cells and shoot him up into the spinal</text><text start="540.39" dur="4.98">cord either where there was spinal cord</text><text start="542.79" dur="5.82">injury or you know degeneration like a</text><text start="545.37" dur="4.91">ALS and they were getting some results</text><text start="548.61" dur="4.38">and they wanted to say well could we</text><text start="550.28" dur="4.66">increase the body&apos;s rate of producing</text><text start="552.99" dur="5.22">its own neural stem cells so they were</text><text start="554.94" dur="5.7">growing neural stem cells in vitro and</text><text start="558.21" dur="4.53">seeing if there were any molecules that</text><text start="560.64" dur="4.17">would increase their own proliferation</text><text start="562.74" dur="5.49">they found some that did an SI 189 was</text><text start="564.81" dur="5.43">the primary one so here it&apos;s a drug that</text><text start="568.23" dur="4.47">isn&apos;t trying to modulate an end chain</text><text start="570.24" dur="5.58">chemical it&apos;s actually up regulating</text><text start="572.7" dur="4.32">your body&apos;s own regulatory process and</text><text start="575.82" dur="2.52">once you have those new neural stem</text><text start="577.02" dur="3.69">cells they keep doing their thing right</text><text start="578.34" dur="4.77">they they become tissues and they do</text><text start="580.71" dur="4.35">their regulatory thing now if you think</text><text start="583.11" dur="3.36">about if that drug continues to succeed</text><text start="585.06" dur="3.2">and I don&apos;t know if it will but there</text><text start="586.47" dur="5.34">will be a whole class of ones like that</text><text start="588.26" dur="6.55">it could fix nerve damage from injury</text><text start="591.81" dur="6.0">nerve damage from neuropathy it could</text><text start="594.81" dur="5.79">fix retinopathy it could fix MS ALS</text><text start="597.81" dur="4.59">Parkinson&apos;s you know and the reason why</text><text start="600.6" dur="4.68">I was working in depression was as they</text><text start="602.4" dur="6.14">were getting up regulated production of</text><text start="605.28" dur="5.52">new stem cells in the hippocampus and</text><text start="608.54" dur="4.99">been that starting to affect the</text><text start="610.8" dur="6.09">surrounding basal structures the person</text><text start="613.53" dur="5.31">actually had more information processing</text><text start="616.89" dur="4.5">capacity to process their emotions and</text><text start="618.84" dur="3.78">process their experiences and they</text><text start="621.39" dur="4.74">didn&apos;t get overwhelmed you get depressed</text><text start="622.62" dur="6.12">by them there&apos;s a company called zing up</text><text start="626.13" dur="5.85">they have a website zing up comm and</text><text start="628.74" dur="6.08">they originally developed friend of mine</text><text start="631.98" dur="6.42">over there developed a set of processes</text><text start="634.82" dur="6.49">that they were trying to bring about for</text><text start="638.4" dur="4.71">helping autism and then what they</text><text start="641.31" dur="3.63">figured out they ended up applying to</text><text start="643.11" dur="3.71">just performance enhancement so right</text><text start="644.94" dur="3.21">now it&apos;s a performance enhancement site</text><text start="646.82" dur="3.61">but they</text><text start="648.15" dur="6.11">that there were you actually really dig</text><text start="650.43" dur="6.06">this they were movement patterns that</text><text start="654.26" dur="5.35">more than other movement patterns</text><text start="656.49" dur="6.45">radically up regulated neural stem cell</text><text start="659.61"

kind of</text><text start="696.6" dur="7.2">profound insight was when you first</text><text start="700.2" dur="6.39">start doing a some kind of coordination</text><text start="703.8"

start="726.9" dur="2.97">okay I&apos;m not nowhere near perfect yet</text><text start="728.61" dur="2.55">but I have the hang like there&apos;s this</text><text start="729.87" dur="4.2">there&apos;s

that and so</text><text start="755.66" dur="3.55">what they figured out to do was how to</text><text start="757.89" dur="3.27">take people through a series of</text><text start="759.21" dur="3.99">exercises and they customized them based</text><text start="761.16" dur="4.7">on assessment but in general anyone</text><text start="763.2" dur="5.88">could do this a series of exercises it</text><text start="765.86" dur="5.14">involved coordination and balance and</text><text start="769.08" dur="4.35">coordinating multiple sensory motor</text><text start="771.0" dur="3.66">groups that were super difficult and as</text><text start="773.43" dur="2.85">soon as you started to get the hang of</text><text start="774.66" dur="2.55">it they switched into a new one and then</text><text start="776.28" dur="2.52">as soon as you&apos;re sure to get the hang</text><text start="777.21" dur="4.14">of it they switched and did a new one so</text><text start="778.8" dur="4.83">you were maximizing for the great the</text><text start="781.35" dur="5.82">growth rate of neurogenesis which then</text><text start="783.63" dur="5.82">ended up having in effect on you know</text><text start="787.17" dur="4.8">all kinds of other things the hypothesis</text><text start="789.45" dur="6.36">there was that it has to do with</text><text start="791.97" dur="5.61">automating learning so we

think about</text><text start="805.47" dur="3.96">that many things consciously so our</text><text start="807.72" dur="3.72">brain has to try to get some of them in</text><text start="809.43" dur="3.54">unconscious memory you know and then we</text><text start="811.44" dur="3.33">can drive a stick-shift without even</text><text start="812.97" dur="3.09">thinking about it when at first it seems</text><text start="814.77" dur="3.9">like seven different hard things to</text><text start="816.06" dur="5.7">coordinate in an evolutionary</text><text start="818.67" dur="5.46">environment us

start="825.51" dur="3.51">new skills now we can unconsciously</text><text start="826.71" dur="4.29">perform it we would have done that for</text><text start="829.02" dur="4.71">motor tasks more than anything else and</text><text start="831.0" dur="4.86">cognitive and language etc tests kind of</text><text start="833.73" dur="5.58">came evolutionarily on top of that so</text><text start="835.86" dur="4.98">our capacity to learn new stuff motor</text><text start="839.31" dur="4.38">tasks are going to be able to drive that</text><text start="840.84" dur="4.89">evolutionary hardware more specifically</text><text start="843.69" dur="6.09">those are hypothesis and it seems to be</text><text start="845.73" dur="8.03">well supported by the evidence and so if</text><text start="849.78" dur="6.57">you do a bunch of sensory motor tasks</text><text start="853.76" dur="3.76">that you can&apos;t do it all and then you</text><text start="856.35" dur="2.58">start to be able to do them and you do a</text><text start="857.52" dur="3.57">bunch of different ones you&apos;re actually</text><text start="858.93" dur="4.05">increasing kind of the neural</text><text start="861.09" dur="4.02">infrastructure for the rate of learning</text><text start="862.98" dur="4.38">and automating conscious - unconscious</text><text start="865.11" dur="3.84">performance and then that same</text><text start="867.36" dur="5.13">infrastructure is used when you are</text><text start="868.95" dur="5.61">learning cognitive tasks or</text><text start="872.49" dur="3.93">interpersonal skills or anything else so</text><text start="874.56" dur="3.39">the idea was that it would increase rate</text><text start="876.42" dur="3.06">of learning and they&apos;ve got a bunch of</text><text start="877.95" dur="5.31">research showing that happens to be the</text><text start="879.48" dur="5.73">case so that&apos;s another example of a of a</text><text start="883.26" dur="4.34">methodology

start="890.01" dur="5.64">approaches for neurogenesis that is</text><text start="892.17" dur="6.45">fascinating I think that explains in</text><text start="895.65" dur="5.13">plain terms how yoga

start="902.82" dur="6.69">complex movements totally I would say</text><text start="906.51" dur="7.21">yoga is probably a combination of that</text><text start="909.51" dur="6.85">effect that we just

dur="5.49">shadow work and integrating parts of</text><text start="1060.54" dur="5.16">self is really fascinating when you</text><text start="1063.81" dur="3.21">realize that we don&apos;t remember when</text><text start="1065.7" dur="3.63">we&apos;re remembering memories we don&apos;t</text><text start="1067.02" dur="5.16">remember the memory we remember how its</text><text start="1069.33" dur="4.2">consolidated in our brain factoring all</text><text start="1072.18" dur="5.4">the times we&apos;ve remembered it and</text><text start="1073.53" dur="6.78">changed it that&apos;s a big insight because</text><text start="1077.58" dur="5.01">it means that if you can re remember a</text><text start="1080.31" dur="4.14">memory and remember it quite differently</text><text start="1082.59" dur="3.51">you can actually affect how it was</text><text start="1084.45" dur="5.01">stored in all the future times it will</text><text start="1086.1" dur="6.09">be referenced and so say someone is on</text><text start="1089.46" dur="5.16">MDMA and so they&apos;re in a pretty aforex</text><text start="1092.19" dur="4.77">state and then they think about some</text><text start="1094.62" dur="4.62">negative experience of their past but</text><text start="1096.96" dur="4.05">they can&apos;t feel they can&apos;t feel negative</text><text start="1099.24" dur="3.0">well they think about it so it would</text><text start="1101.01" dur="3.03">always be in the past that they would</text><text start="1102.24" dur="3.3">think about it and feel negative right</text><text start="1104.04" dur="2.67">they have that associative conditioning</text><text start="1105.54" dur="3.21">now they&apos;re thinking about it and</text><text start="1106.71" dur="3.99">feeling great so that means that the</text><text start="1108.75" dur="3.48">regions of the brain and the chemistry</text><text start="1110.7" dur="4.11">that&apos;s involved in feeling great and</text><text start="1112.23" dur="6.84">that specific thought or Co wiring</text><text start="1114.81" dur="6.15">together and then the next time when</text><text start="1119.07" dur="3.6">this person is sober and they think</text><text start="1120.96" dur="3.0">about it they remember the last way they</text><text start="1122.67" dur="3.48">remember it and it doesn&apos;t have that</text><text start="1123.96" dur="5.22">same charge that it used to have for</text><text start="1126.15" dur="4.5">them this can be about a traumatic</text><text start="1129.18" dur="3.42">memory of the past it can also be</text><text start="1130.65" dur="3.75">thinking about parts of themselves that</text><text start="1132.6" dur="4.44">they&apos;re ashamed of or can&apos;t love or</text><text start="1134.4" dur="5.1">whatever and instantly like in a fairly</text><text start="1137.04" dur="6.66">short amount of time one or a small</text><text start="1139.5" dur="8.34">number of sessions radically change the</text><text start="1143.7" dur="5.52">charge around psychological topics this</text><text start="1147.84" dur="4.32">is something I&apos;ve been really interested</text><text start="1149.22" dur="4.47">in in and thinking about and partially</text><text start="1152.16" dur="3.75">why I brought up the whole idea of the</text><text start="1153.69" dur="3.96">gut brain and asking your gut how you</text><text start="1155.91" dur="4.11">feel about something because I&apos;m trying</text><text start="1157.65" dur="4.8">to separate how I feel and what I think</text><text start="1160.02" dur="5.67">about memories and about how I look into</text><text start="1162.45" dur="6.27">the future so this has been an extremely</text><text start="1165.69" dur="5.97">useful tool for me because I separate</text><text start="1168.72" dur="4.86">the memory into its two components and</text><text start="1171.66" dur="3.89">then process the emotions on their own</text><text start="1173.58" dur="4.59">so that I don&apos;t have to continue feeling</text><text start="1175.55" dur="3.73">negatively about an event yeah that</text><text start="1178.17" dur="3.11">worked really well you know because you</text><text start="1179.28" dur="4.28">have the memory of just</text><text start="1181.28" dur="4.17">what happened and then you have all the</text><text start="1183.56" dur="3.54">meaning-making around it and the</text><text start="1185.45" dur="3.06">meaning-making can change while you</text><text start="1187.1" dur="3.84">still remember the event that happened</text><text start="1188.51" dur="4.05">and when the meaning-making changes the</text><text start="1190.94" dur="6.75">cymatics and the emotions can change</text><text start="1192.56" dur="7.82">accordingly right so you experience some</text><text start="1197.69" dur="4.77">event in childhood and the meaning was</text><text start="1200.38" dur="3.55">something about that you&apos;re a failure</text><text start="1202.46" dur="3.81">and you should never try stuff and</text><text start="1203.93" dur="4.02">whatever and when you reprocess and say</text><text start="1206.27" dur="4.32">actually that&apos;s not a realistic meaning</text><text start="1207.95" dur="4.29">I was a kid and you know I have actually</text><text start="1210.59" dur="4.86">done well of those things later etcetera</text><text start="1212.24" dur="6.54">you can still remember the event but it</text><text start="1215.45" dur="5.28">doesn&apos;t have the same Associated meaning</text><text start="1218.78" dur="4.65">about self and about reality so then it</text><text start="1220.73" dur="4.44">doesn&apos;t have the same charge the fear</text><text start="1223.43" dur="3.57">charge that&apos;s trying to protect you from</text><text start="1225.17" dur="4.68">that painful possibility in the future</text><text start="1227.0" dur="4.29">etc you can do that without psychedelics</text><text start="1229.85" dur="3.87">psychedelics just happened to be one</text><text start="1231.29" dur="5.49">very fast way to change that association</text><text start="1233.72" dur="5.49">yeah I think psychotherapy is another</text><text start="1236.78" dur="4.44">one and also hypnotherapy because you</text><text start="1239.21" dur="4.95">can induce somebody into trance and then</text><text start="1241.22" dur="5.4">reom print the certain experience so</text><text start="1244.16" dur="4.59">that exactly like you were saying the</text><text start="1246.62" dur="3.84">processing of it changes how your brain</text><text start="1248.75" dur="5.28">processes that so when you talk about</text><text start="1250.46" dur="6.99">hypnotherapy and inducing trance if</text><text start="1254.03" dur="6.21">we&apos;re going to try and change the way</text><text start="1257.45" dur="4.95">that someone has stored of memory or</text><text start="1260.24" dur="4.62">change their association with a phobia</text><text start="1262.4" dur="6.0">or whatever it is then we want to get</text><text start="1264.86" dur="6.09">them into a state that is amenable to</text><text start="1268.4" dur="4.14">change right psychedelics are a good way</text><text start="1270.95" dur="3.75">of doing this largely because they</text><text start="1272.54" dur="4.23">actually increased neuroplasticity so we</text><text start="1274.7" dur="5.57">talked about neurogenesis developing new</text><text start="1276.77" dur="6.99">neurons but developing new synapses and</text><text start="1280.27" dur="6.67">cleaning old synapses might be even more</text><text start="1283.76" dur="6.66">meaningful which is what in the brain</text><text start="1286.94" dur="5.64">interconnects with with what so old</text><text start="1290.42" dur="4.74">synapses that are no longer relevant can</text><text start="1292.58" dur="5.4">get cleaved mostly during deep sleep by</text><text start="1295.16" dur="4.5">microglia and then new synapses get</text><text start="1297.98" dur="3.9">developed it&apos;s called synaptogenesis</text><text start="1299.66" dur="3.87">through the learning process so like</text><text start="1301.88" dur="3.21">that zing up example as you go from</text><text start="1303.53" dur="3.33">can&apos;t find it at all to find it that&apos;s</text><text start="1305.09" dur="4.62">the process of synaptic formation and</text><text start="1306.86" dur="6.09">then healthy synapses that are doing</text><text start="1309.71" dur="4.5">something effective get re supported</text><text start="1312.95" dur="1.75">through something called the long term</text><text start="1314.21" dur="2.26">potential</text><text start="1314.7"

dur="4.89">someone has a really powerful trip it</text><text start="1351.21" dur="4.53">can be so permanently changing for them</text><text start="1353.61" dur="4.32">is because what was happening during</text><text start="1355.74" dur="4.95">that time was having more net impact on</text><text start="1357.93" dur="4.68">their brain than is usually capable of</text><text start="1360.69" dur="2.76">happening per unit time right right</text><text start="1362.61" dur="3.48">interesting</text><text start="1363.45" dur="4.68">so psychedelics can do that breath work</text><text

could</text><text start="1703.85" dur="2.819">be a rite of passage to recognize it</text><text start="1705.409" dur="3.27">sometimes they got a different name at</text><text start="1706.669"

narrative for</text><text start="1833.9" dur="4.83">this after the Scientific Revolution</text><text start="1836.27" dur="5.55">science was just awesome for so many</text><text start="1838.73" dur="5.4">things but the point of the challenges</text><text start="1841.82" dur="4.05">became so what&apos;s real is what&apos;s</text><text start="1844.13" dur="4.08">measurable and if something isn&apos;t</text><text start="1845.87" dur="3.0">measurable you can&apos;t do anything really</text><text start="1848.21" dur="3.45">with it</text><text start="1848.87" dur="4.8">and comfort was an easier to measure</text><text start="1851.66" dur="3.45">thing than happiness was right we could</text><text start="1853.67" dur="4.26">kind of objectively measure how</text><text start="1855.11" dur="4.62">comfortable mattresses were and how good</text><text start="1857.93" dur="3.42">the shock systems and cars were and</text><text start="1859.73" dur="4.38">transport be able to measure evolution</text><text start="1861.35" dur="4.5">in those ways but measuring individual</text><text start="1864.11" dur="3.72">human happiness is a much trickier thing</text><text start="1865.85" dur="4.65">to do and so you can see how much we</text><text start="1867.83" dur="5.07">like people have physical comforts now</text><text start="1870.5" dur="6.32">even just average people that Kings</text><text start="1872.9" dur="7.29">didn&apos;t have in the past and yet we have</text><text start="1876.82" dur="5.739">rampant mental illness that we also</text><text start="1880.19"

they have</text><text start="1885.37" dur="6.97">practices that intentionally induced</text><text start="1888.64" dur="6.31">meaningful discomfort to teach people to</text><text start="1892.34"

that</text><text start="2128.23" dur="2.82">they see through and so one of the</text><text start="2129.55" dur="3.33">things that I needed were heavy foods</text><text start="2131.05" dur="3.15">and

dur="4.17">think almost any of us would say all</text><text start="2256.31" dur="2.82">right let&apos;s trade and go live in</text><text start="2257.57" dur="3.15">indigenous culture even though there&apos;s</text><text start="2259.13" dur="3.81">so many upsides right because there&apos;s</text><text start="2260.72" dur="5.3">also so many upsides to modern</text><text start="2262.94" dur="5.7">technological life but to be able to</text><text start="2266.02" dur="3.15">advance and integrate both is a great</text><text start="2268.64" dur="3.69">thing</text><text start="2269.17" dur="5.02">along the lines of rites of passage that</text><text start="2272.33" dur="4.14">you brought up earlier I think some of</text><text start="2274.19" dur="4.53">the basic ones like the rites of passage</text><text start="2276.47" dur="5.04">to become an adult you know becoming a</text><text start="2278.72" dur="4.95">teenager are pretty obvious but what</text><text start="2281.51" dur="4.11">would you say that are in the context of</text><text start="2283.67" dur="4.32">our modern technology and world would be</text><text start="2285.62" dur="4.86">a good idea to create as a new rite of</text><text start="2287.99" dur="3.93">passage for example like the day you&apos;re</text><text start="2290.48" dur="5.04">allowed to use your cell phone or</text><text start="2291.92" dur="7.53">something being a cultural thing to be</text><text start="2295.52" dur="5.61">using social media in a responsible and</text><text start="2299.45" dur="3.6">effective way that&apos;s you know you&apos;re not</text><text start="2301.13" dur="4.11">addicted to notifications and that sort</text><text start="2303.05" dur="4.08">of thing I would say it is a great</text><text start="2305.24" dur="3.75">inquiry for us to think about the rites</text><text start="2307.13" dur="3.63">of passage did have a lot to do with</text><text start="2308.99" dur="4.92">both making some sure someone was</text><text start="2310.76" dur="6.84">prepared for a certain kind of</text><text start="2313.91" dur="7.23">responsibility and predisposing them to</text><text start="2317.6" dur="5.97">handle it well and so as we get is we</text><text start="2321.14" dur="4.59">have the technological capacity to be</text><text start="2323.57" dur="3.68">more affected by our tech and to affect</text><text start="2325.73" dur="4.2">more in the world through our tech to</text><text start="2327.25" dur="5.56">you know we both need to prepare we both</text><text start="2329.93" dur="4.8">need to build the tech better itself so</text><text start="2332.81" dur="5.25">you know Tristan Harris and others are</text><text start="2334.73" dur="5.07">talking a lot about how we we&apos;re</text><text start="2338.06" dur="4.37">building text it is actually really</text><text start="2339.8" dur="6.36">mostly bad for humans right that is</text><text start="2342.43" dur="6.34">optimizing blue-screen clickbait</text><text start="2346.16" dur="4.79">dopamine addiction for people with</text><text start="2348.77" dur="4.92">really shitty attention spans and</text><text start="2350.95" dur="4.27">distraction issues and like we actually</text><text start="2353.69" dur="4.83">need to build the tech differently</text><text start="2355.22" dur="5.52">itself because again this is like this</text><text start="2358.52" dur="3.87">is a gaming mechanics thing if I&apos;m</text><text start="2360.74" dur="3.24">focused on how do I get the most number</text><text start="2362.39" dur="2.94">of clicks and the most time on sight</text><text start="2363.98" dur="3.42">that&apos;s not gonna make the happiest</text><text start="2365.33" dur="3.27">people right and the happiest people are</text><text start="2367.4" dur="3.48">gonna come do their and then</text><text start="2368.6" dur="4.59">probably leave and do different kinds of</text><text start="2370.88" dur="4.5">behavior that are not focused on driving</text><text start="2373.19" dur="4.26">clicking on ADD so if I learn how to</text><text start="2375.38" dur="5.07">hijack their dopamine opioid responds</text><text start="2377.45" dur="4.2">this is a bad thing so part of it is</text><text start="2380.45" dur="2.94">that we actually just have to develop</text><text start="2381.65" dur="3.3">the technology differently</text><text start="2383.39" dur="4.169">and again that gets back into the theory</text><text start="2384.95" dur="4.829">of incentives right so just like with</text><text start="2387.559" dur="4.111">the pharmaceuticals if the incentives of</text><text start="2389.779" dur="3.57">the tech developers are not exactly</text><text start="2391.67" dur="2.909">aligned with the well-being of the</text><text start="2393.349" dur="3.391">people that the tech is being developed</text><text start="2394.579" dur="5.581">for we&apos;re gonna get a deep mismatch</text><text start="2396.74" dur="5.129">right mm-hmm so anywhere that incentive</text><text start="2400.16" dur="3.99">and well-being is misaligned that</text><text start="2401.869" dur="4.291">externality gap is a problem and with</text><text start="2404.15" dur="3.689">exponential tech capacity that</text><text start="2406.16" dur="5.55">externality gap becomes a catastrophic</text><text start="2407.839" dur="7.081">problem but I think also preparing</text><text start="2411.71" dur="5.52">people to handle the responsibility of</text><text start="2414.92" dur="4.34">tech better is a meaningful part of it</text><text start="2417.23" dur="5.369">and so I would be very curious to see</text><text start="2419.26" dur="5.289">what the right rites of passage in the</text><text start="2422.599" dur="3.48">future might look like this is why</text><text start="2424.549" dur="4.32">blockchain has become such an</text><text start="2426.079" dur="4.381">interesting thing for us because it it&apos;s</text><text start="2428.869" dur="3.811">a different way of looking at building</text><text start="2430.46" dur="4.98">these technologies while removing the</text><text start="2432.68" dur="5.22">incentives to optimize for a single</text><text start="2435.44" dur="4.859">entity you know for example clickbait</text><text start="2437.9" dur="4.379">time on site that sort of thing so I</text><text start="2440.299" dur="4.191">picture using the blockchain to develop</text><text start="2442.279" dur="5.431">an operating system for a phone that</text><text start="2444.49" dur="4.93">would be open-source and people could</text><text start="2447.71" dur="4.619">develop something like maybe making</text><text start="2449.42" dur="5.159">adblock and that sort of thing native to</text><text start="2452.329" dur="3.96">the phone right and then you know</text><text start="2454.579" dur="3.061">building in a whole operating system</text><text start="2456.289" dur="4.02">around this principle of we&apos;re gonna</text><text start="2457.64" dur="5.31">make it better for the human and then I</text><text start="2460.309" dur="4.8">also picture having sort of the rites of</text><text start="2462.95" dur="4.169">passage and rituals built into that</text><text start="2465.109" dur="4.23">operating system - right so now let&apos;s</text><text start="2467.119" dur="3.75">expend this one step and I&apos;ll say the</text><text start="2469.339" dur="5.22">the big picture of how I think about</text><text start="2470.869" dur="8.041">neural hacking is everything in your</text><text start="2474.559" dur="8.04">environment is affecting you right this</text><text start="2478.91"

I</text><text start="2691.05" dur="4.59">actually think that&apos;s a fair way to</text><text start="2693.36" dur="5.76">think about what humanity&apos;s task today</text><text start="2695.64" dur="7.11">is it&apos;s to rebuild all of civilization</text><text start="2699.12" dur="7.35">from scratch meaning our monetary</text><text start="2702.75" dur="5.82">incentives our social status

that&apos;s our task</text><text start="2728.94" dur="4.8">well</text><text start="2729.96" dur="5.73">mind blown yeah so we might be reaching</text><text start="2733.74" dur="4.35">the end of our time here but this brings</text><text start="2735.69" dur="4.62">up another really interesting point of</text><text start="2738.09" dur="4.53">focus for maybe a future episode is</text><text start="2740.31" dur="3.96">talking about what you guys are doing</text><text start="2742.62" dur="3.87">with neuro hacker collective and sort of</text><text start="2744.27" dur="4.8">the big picture systems approach you&apos;re</text><text start="2746.49" dur="4.26">taking the mothership yeah well I think</text><text start="2749.07" dur="3.75">we have flagged a few follow-up</text><text start="2750.75" dur="5.13">conversations on just this conversation</text><text start="2752.82" dur="5.49">already so we&apos;ve got the hard problem of</text><text start="2755.88" dur="5.64">consciousness and existentialism maybe</text><text start="2758.31" dur="5.85">some deeper stuff about what is good in</text><text start="2761.52" dur="6.29">indigenous wisdom I think we talked</text><text start="2764.16" dur="5.46">about briefly before the show what does</text><text start="2767.81" dur="3.4">transhumanism look like in this</text><text start="2769.62" dur="5.07">framework what is a kind of</text><text start="2771.21" dur="5.75">transhumanism that is optimizing for</text><text start="2774.69" dur="4.23">thriving across all metrics and that</text><text start="2776.96" dur="4.87">understands the complex complicated</text><text start="2778.92" dur="4.41">distinction and maybe how we&apos;re thinking</text><text start="2781.83" dur="2.82">about all those things and what we&apos;re</text><text start="2783.33" dur="1.65">doing neural hackers so it sounds like</text><text start="2784.65" dur="2.4">we have</text><text start="2784.98" dur="4.8">some conversations ahead definitely</text><text start="2787.05" dur="4.29">fantastic cool well let&apos;s wrap up there</text><text start="2789.78" dur="2.61">then Daniel is really good to have you</text><text start="2791.34" dur="2.49">on the show again</text><text start="2792.39" dur="3.12">minds blown I think we&apos;re gonna be</text><text start="2793.83" dur="5.16">talking about this for weeks</text><text start="2795.51" dur="5.79">and I offer one more thought about what</text><text start="2798.99" dur="5.96">you all are doing in your show sure we</text><text start="2801.3" dur="6.75">have so many more apocalyptic and</text><text start="2804.95" dur="3.52">dystopian visions for our future than we</text><text start="2808.05" dur="4.65">do</text><text start="2808.47" dur="6.09">possibly viable proto pick ones so when</text><text start="2812.7" dur="5.07">you guys you know are thinking about and</text><text start="2814.56" dur="5.64">sharing the show what are positive</text><text start="2817.77" dur="4.26">visions of a future if we share positive</text><text start="2820.2" dur="4.2">visions of a future that aren&apos;t actually</text><text start="2822.03" dur="3.9">tenable right they they aren&apos;t actually</text><text start="2824.4" dur="3.99">anti fragile in the presence of</text><text start="2825.93" dur="5.64">exponential tech or they presuppose</text><text start="2828.39" dur="4.41">things that involve going backwards in</text><text start="2831.57" dur="5.78">ways that would never be selected for</text><text start="2832.8" dur="8.25">those are useless but to have more</text><text start="2837.35" dur="6.25">humans visioning what is a viable</text><text start="2841.05" dur="4.559">thriving civilization aligned with our</text><text start="2843.6" dur="4.2">evolving capacities what could it look</text><text start="2845.609" dur="4.171">like I think that&apos;s actually one of the</text><text start="2847.8" dur="5.73">most critical things that has to be</text><text start="2849.78" dur="5.01">happening more for Humanity to make it</text><text start="2853.53" dur="4.32">and for those positive visions to come</text><text start="2854.79" dur="6.45">about completely agree there&apos;s two sort</text><text start="2857.85" dur="5.04">of key tenants that we have discussed so</text><text start="2861.24" dur="4.02">much in the past which is behind our</text><text start="2862.89" dur="4.77">thinking about future thinkers which is</text><text start="2865.26" dur="4.77">you don&apos;t create a better future by</text><text start="2867.66" dur="4.35">visualizing the worst case scenario all</text><text start="2870.03" dur="3.93">the time and not thinking of the actual</text><text start="2872.01" dur="4.44">thing that you want yes and that works</text><text start="2873.96" dur="4.92">across the board with business with</text><text start="2876.45" dur="4.29">anything that we&apos;ve had experience you</text><text start="2878.88" dur="3.479">know creating our lifestyle just like</text><text start="2880.74" dur="3.15">you can look at our lifestyles in the</text><text start="2882.359" dur="4.651">fact that we&apos;ve traveled for five years</text><text start="2883.89" dur="5.19">and basically done anything on a whim</text><text start="2887.01" dur="4.17">that we&apos;ve desired to do because that&apos;s</text><text start="2889.08" dur="3.81">the thing we go after we visualize what</text><text start="2891.18" dur="3.09">would be great how what would improve</text><text start="2892.89" dur="5.219">our lives then we go after that thing</text><text start="2894.27" dur="7.19">and then the second thing is not being</text><text start="2898.109" dur="5.731">uncomfortable with discomfort and and</text><text start="2901.46" dur="4.86">negative possibilities of the future as</text><text start="2903.84" dur="5.4">well and actually spending the time to</text><text start="2906.32" dur="5.68">incorporate antifragility like you said</text><text start="2909.24" dur="5.25">and recovering from negative situations</text><text start="2912.0" dur="4.92">into your plan for the future yeah so I</text><text start="2914.49" dur="4.109">think that that is you made that point</text><text start="2916.92" dur="3.659">earlier in the show and I think that is</text><text start="2918.599" dur="4.17">huge and we keep harping on this lately</text><text start="2920.579" dur="3.9">that you have to in order to be</text><text start="2922.769" dur="4.76">resilient you have to actually be</text><text start="2924.479" dur="6.691">comfortable with being uncomfortable yes</text><text start="2927.529" dur="5.2">definitely well
