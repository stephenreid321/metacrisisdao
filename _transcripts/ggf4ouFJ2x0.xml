to</text><text start="8.96" dur="3.2">kill a plant to eat or we&apos;re going to</text><text start="10.16" dur="3.359">kill an animal to eat it is it still the</text><text start="12.16" dur="3.04">fundamental truth that we have to kill</text><text start="13.519" dur="3.68">to eat and it&apos;s all the same are we</text><text start="15.2" dur="3.36">still being specious to</text><text start="17.199" dur="3.361">you know pick</text><text start="18.56" dur="3.76">killing plants over animals and i think</text><text start="20.56" dur="2.639">there&apos;s actually some core distinctions</text><text start="22.32" dur="1.84">here</text><text start="23.199" dur="2.801">that</text><text start="24.16" dur="4.24">are really worth making there&apos;s an</text><text start="26.0" dur="4.16">evolutionary purpose for pain</text><text start="28.4" dur="2.959">and really the ethic that we&apos;re looking</text><text start="30.16" dur="4.32">at here</text><text start="31.359" dur="4.641">is cause no harm or cause as little harm</text><text start="34.48" dur="3.28">as possible</text><text start="36.0" dur="4.32">to the point of view of a sentient</text><text start="37.76" dur="4.08">experience right</text><text start="40.32" dur="2.96">shattering a rock apart if the rock</text><text start="41.84" dur="3.68">doesn&apos;t feel anything isn&apos;t an act of</text><text start="43.28" dur="3.68">violence even though there was harm</text><text start="45.52" dur="3.039">from one point of view but the rock</text><text start="46.96" dur="2.72">wasn&apos;t experiencing as far as we know</text><text start="48.559" dur="3.761">about rocks</text><text start="49.68" dur="4.879">um he wasn&apos;t experiencing harm so when</text><text start="52.32" dur="3.759">we say cause no harm or cause the least</text><text start="54.559" dur="4.16">amount of harm possible it&apos;s two things</text><text start="56.079" dur="4.32">capable of experiencing that harm right</text><text start="58.719" dur="4.721">and so</text><text start="60.399" dur="5.76">there&apos;s an evolutionary purpose for pain</text><text start="63.44" dur="5.039">which is to be able to move away from</text><text start="66.159" dur="4.721">something harmful to the organism</text><text start="68.479" dur="4.401">okay so in all animals</text><text start="70.88" dur="3.68">our sensory nerves nerves that take in</text><text start="72.88" dur="3.04">information and our motor nerves our</text><text start="74.56" dur="3.04">nerves that can then respond to that</text><text start="75.92" dur="3.28">information are intimately tied and they</text><text start="77.6" dur="3.12">actually co-evolve going up the</text><text start="79.2" dur="3.52">evolutionary ladder</text><text start="80.72" dur="3.36">and so</text><text start="82.72" dur="3.2">notice that whenever there&apos;s a pain</text><text start="84.08" dur="4.399">response it will always trigger a motor</text><text start="85.92" dur="4.32">response one of two kinds so either</text><text start="88.479" dur="4.161">you touch something hot or sharp and you</text><text start="90.24" dur="4.239">move away from it or you have a sprained</text><text start="92.64" dur="3.76">ankle and you make sure not to step on</text><text start="94.479" dur="4.081">it or not move into it but the purpose</text><text start="96.4" dur="3.759">of that pain is to protect the the</text><text start="98.56" dur="3.36">organism because of some response</text><text start="100.159" dur="4.64">capacity and that response capacity</text><text start="101.92" dur="4.32">involves our movement capacity right so</text><text start="104.799" dur="3.921">this is a place where plants and animals</text><text start="106.24" dur="5.36">fundamentally differ plants don&apos;t have</text><text start="108.72" dur="4.48">real-time movement capacity right they</text><text start="111.6" dur="3.199">a sunflower can track the sun over the</text><text start="113.2" dur="3.04">course of a day very slowly but they</text><text start="114.799" dur="3.6">don&apos;t have the ability to move away from</text><text start="116.24" dur="4.159">something harmful or to stop moving in</text><text start="118.399" dur="4.4">some way that&apos;s harmful to them and so</text><text start="120.399" dur="3.921">there&apos;s no evolutionary purpose for pain</text><text start="122.799" dur="3.041">for them and it&apos;s important to</text><text start="124.32" dur="3.439">understand that the process of</text><text start="125.84" dur="3.839">experiencing pain</text><text start="127.759" dur="4.641">it&apos;s physiologically mediated and it</text><text start="129.679" dur="6.56">requires a lot of energy so in us the</text><text start="132.4" dur="3.839">pain process is mediated through</text><text start="136.8" dur="4.96">acetylcholine crossing synaptic gaps</text><text start="139.2" dur="4.56">producing an opiate response you know</text><text start="141.76" dur="3.6">in adrenal and sympathetic responses</text><text start="143.76" dur="3.68">there&apos;s a lot of energy required to</text><text start="145.36" dur="4.64">experience pain and that was only</text><text start="147.44" dur="4.48">selected for because it was advantageous</text><text start="150.0" dur="3.599">that the creatures who experienced it</text><text start="151.92" dur="3.039">moved away from harm better or didn&apos;t</text><text start="153.599" dur="2.801">move into harm better so they they</text><text start="154.959" dur="3.041">actually got through reproduce better</text><text start="156.4" dur="3.839">and natural selection selected for their</text><text start="158.0" dur="4.8">ability to feel pain right</text><text start="160.239" dur="4.321">when if a tree or a plant the key to how</text><text start="162.8" dur="3.68">they can gather energy from sunlight and</text><text start="164.56" dur="3.759">none of the other animals can has to do</text><text start="166.48" dur="3.28">with their ability to be rooted and be</text><text start="168.319" dur="4.0">able to gather a huge amount of</text><text start="169.76" dur="4.88">nutrition from the soil and to be able</text><text start="172.319" dur="4.081">to support this huge base of foliage</text><text start="174.64" dur="3.599">that can do all of this photoreception</text><text start="176.4" dur="3.839">right and so because of that they give</text><text start="178.239" dur="3.681">up the ability for movement and with it</text><text start="180.239" dur="3.521">there really is no evolutionary purpose</text><text start="181.92" dur="3.44">for pain wouldn&apos;t have been selected for</text><text start="183.76" dur="3.52">that&apos;s the first thing</text><text start="185.36" dur="4.239">the second thing is that</text><text start="187.28" dur="4.319">when we look in other animals we see</text><text start="189.599" dur="4.0">in their nervous system opiate receptors</text><text start="191.599" dur="4.0">on their neurons which have to do with</text><text start="193.599" dur="5.201">the chemistry of modulating the pain</text><text start="195.599" dur="5.041">process and we see that on every animal</text><text start="198.8" dur="3.519">all the way down to</text><text start="200.64" dur="3.84">hinge valve creatures like clams and</text><text start="202.319" dur="4.401">they all have the same kinds of opiate</text><text start="204.48" dur="4.16">structures that you know indicate the</text><text start="206.72" dur="3.439">same kinds of pain processes because</text><text start="208.64" dur="3.12">they have an ability to respond and the</text><text start="210.159" dur="3.281">clam is kind of the most simple one</text><text start="211.76" dur="3.6">which is they can close up if there&apos;s</text><text start="213.44" dur="3.439">something potentially harmful that means</text><text start="215.36" dur="2.879">they have to experience harm right</text><text start="216.879" dur="4.08">experience something subjectively and</text><text start="218.239" dur="4.401">they can open in response to um</text><text start="220.959" dur="3.84">to positive stimuli or at least a lack</text><text start="222.64" dur="4.239">of negative stimuli in the plant kingdom</text><text start="224.799" dur="4.401">we don&apos;t see anything like</text><text start="226.879" dur="5.201">an opiate kind of chemistry and we don&apos;t</text><text start="229.2" dur="5.36">see anything response wise like that now</text><text start="232.08" dur="4.079">the book uh the secret life of plants</text><text start="234.56" dur="3.679">and um</text><text start="236.159" dur="3.121">you know a number of books and studies</text><text start="238.239" dur="2.881">that have been done that show that</text><text start="239.28" dur="3.92">plants do show some kind of electrical</text><text start="241.12" dur="4.0">response to being cut or to other plants</text><text start="243.2" dur="3.52">being cut or burned in their presence</text><text start="245.12" dur="4.24">doesn&apos;t mean plants have no response</text><text start="246.72" dur="2.64">capacity</text><text start="250.959" dur="4.401">but their response capacity is very very</text><text start="253.2" dur="4.559">limited relative to animals response</text><text start="255.36" dur="4.32">capacity and so the main kind of thing</text><text start="257.759" dur="3.44">is if a plant is being cut it can&apos;t stop</text><text start="259.68" dur="2.64">that from happening cannot move away</text><text start="261.199" dur="2.961">from it</text><text start="262.32" dur="4.08">can&apos;t pull into its turtle shell can&apos;t</text><text start="264.16" dur="5.44">close its clamshell can&apos;t what it can do</text><text start="266.4" dur="5.92">is it can add resins to the sap in that</text><text start="269.6" dur="4.48">area to be able to stop the loss of sap</text><text start="272.32" dur="4.319">right and so when we see the electrical</text><text start="274.08" dur="4.88">responses galvanic responses in plants</text><text start="276.639" dur="4.0">we see that they&apos;re responding and we</text><text start="278.96" dur="3.36">can anthropomorphize that and call it</text><text start="280.639" dur="3.201">plant screaming but we don&apos;t really see</text><text start="282.32" dur="3.04">any basis to</text><text start="283.84" dur="3.919">to suspect that the plant is having a</text><text start="285.36" dur="4.16">subjective experience of pain does this</text><text start="287.759" dur="4.081">mean that plants have no subjective</text><text start="289.52" dur="3.84">experience at all no qualia this is</text><text start="291.84" dur="2.799">actually at the edge of our scientific</text><text start="293.36" dur="3.2">knowledge we don&apos;t know most</text><text start="294.639" dur="4.481">neuroscientists say no plants don&apos;t have</text><text start="296.56" dur="4.48">any experience some people have reason</text><text start="299.12" dur="2.72">to think that they do have experience</text><text start="301.04" dur="2.4">but</text><text start="301.84" dur="3.44">we don&apos;t have any reason to think that</text><text start="303.44" dur="4.56">there&apos;s an evolutionary relevance for</text><text start="305.28" dur="4.0">them or any indication of an actual pain</text><text start="308.0" dur="2.56">or kind of suffering process because</text><text start="309.28" dur="4.0">they couldn&apos;t respond to it and they</text><text start="310.56" dur="4.56">don&apos;t show those signs um</text><text start="313.28" dur="5.12">so that&apos;s a major distinction right in</text><text start="315.12" dur="6.24">the in in the process of saying hey if</text><text start="318.4" dur="6.16">i&apos;m taking a plant life here</text><text start="321.36" dur="4.399">um it&apos;s still alive but am i inducing</text><text start="324.56" dur="3.919">suffering</text><text start="325.759" dur="4.801">and all the indications we have indicate</text><text start="328.479" dur="3.921">no and even if so in a radically</text><text start="330.56" dur="3.84">different way right</text><text start="332.4" dur="4.239">the other thing that&apos;s worth noting is</text><text start="334.4" dur="3.68">that even if there was some</text><text start="336.639" dur="3.361">pain or suffering that the plant</text><text start="338.08" dur="2.88">experienced</text><text start="340.0" dur="2.8">when we</text><text start="340.96" dur="3.04">are eating animals the animals had to</text><text start="342.8" dur="3.119">eat plants</text><text start="344.0" dur="3.68">and they there&apos;s some entropy there&apos;s</text><text start="345.919" dur="4.241">some energy loss in that process so it&apos;s</text><text start="347.68" dur="3.68">going to take many pounds of plant</text><text start="350.16" dur="3.44">vegetation</text><text start="351.36" dur="5.119">to produce a pound of animal vegetation</text><text start="353.6" dur="4.4">that then the person could eat and so by</text><text start="356.479" dur="3.201">supporting the supply and demand chain</text><text start="358.0" dur="3.919">of eating that animal you&apos;re causing the</text><text start="359.68" dur="4.079">harm to the animal plus</text><text start="361.919" dur="3.84">that towards however many other plants</text><text start="363.759" dur="5.521">so that there&apos;s really kind of no water</text><text start="365.759" dur="3.521">held in that argument</text></transcript>
