dur="4.589">know you&apos;ve been hugely busy over the</text><text start="9.809" dur="5.0">last few days you&apos;re probably a familiar</text><text start="12.599" dur="4.561">face to many people on the channel and</text><text start="14.809" dur="4.121">maybe people aren&apos;t aware that you&apos;ve</text><text start="17.16" dur="4.05">been deeply involved with the response</text><text start="18.93" dur="4.83">to this pandemic from the medical side</text><text start="21.21" dur="6.6">from the economic side liaison with</text><text start="23.76" dur="6.15">institutions and agencies and we we&apos;re</text><text start="27.81" dur="4.199">going to cover here like the situational</text><text start="29.91" dur="4.38">assessments where are we at right now</text><text start="32.009" dur="4.831">and what is the really crucial</text><text start="34.29" dur="6.839">information that people need to know and</text><text start="36.84" dur="8.46">act on right now yeah</text><text start="41.129" dur="7.86">thank you David so we are recording on</text><text start="45.3" dur="5.419">March 21st I&apos;m saying that because we&apos;re</text><text start="48.989" dur="6.451">going to be giving a real-time</text><text start="50.719" dur="7.331">assessment and also recommendations and</text><text start="55.44" dur="4.08">many of these recommendations will have</text><text start="58.05" dur="2.849">already happened and will be on to new</text><text start="59.52" dur="4.41">things and the assessment will have</text><text start="60.899" dur="6.561">changed a few days from now so much of</text><text start="63.93" dur="7.189">this information is rapidly changing</text><text start="67.46" dur="6.79">also as a preface not a medical doctor</text><text start="71.119" dur="5.551">so I&apos;m not giving medical advice here I</text><text start="74.25" dur="5.25">am working with a number of groups</text><text start="76.67" dur="5.14">seeking to get good information and good</text><text start="79.5" dur="7.02">response across us so as a source of</text><text start="81.81" dur="7.14">preface we&apos;ll start with a kind of</text><text start="86.52" dur="4.2">situation assessment and then what a</text><text start="88.95" dur="4.349">risk assessment of how the situation</text><text start="90.72" dur="5.759">could have full unfold based on unknowns</text><text start="93.299" dur="6.201">and different response types would be</text><text start="96.479" dur="8.82">and then response recommendations and</text><text start="99.5" dur="7.75">then some brief notes on the background</text><text start="105.299" dur="3.691">situation that has brought us here and</text><text start="107.25" dur="4.02">what the kind of bigger picture</text><text start="108.99" dur="4.65">responses need to be for systemic</text><text start="111.27" dur="7.08">fragility and catastrophic risk writ</text><text start="113.64" dur="9.03">large I&apos;ll start with just a quick note</text><text start="118.35" dur="7.89">on the nature of bias and assessing</text><text start="122.67" dur="7.559">things like this because most everyone</text><text start="126.24" dur="7.85">has seen a range of responses from this</text><text start="130.229" dur="6.571">is no big deal it&apos;s just a flu</text><text start="134.09" dur="9.61">- this is the end of the world as we</text><text start="136.8" dur="10.11">know it and so obviously most of those</text><text start="143.7" dur="6.42">responses are not particularly clearly</text><text start="146.91" dur="5.07">informed but even amongst the clearly</text><text start="150.12" dur="3.45">informed things the curves can be very</text><text start="151.98" dur="3.51">different based on how we respond and</text><text start="153.57" dur="4.89">there&apos;s a lot of unknown still we don&apos;t</text><text start="155.49" dur="4.8">know if getting the infection and</text><text start="158.46" dur="3.99">recovering will confer immunity - where</text><text start="160.29" dur="5.61">you don&apos;t get it again or if you don&apos;t</text><text start="162.45" dur="6.63">get it for across what range of changes</text><text start="165.9" dur="6.93">in mutation so given that there&apos;s also a</text><text start="169.08" dur="6.57">lot of unknowns including confounding</text><text start="172.83" dur="5.1">variables that could occur you do get a</text><text start="175.65" dur="4.62">pretty wide range of estimates so I&apos;m</text><text start="177.93" dur="4.32">gonna speak to in the risk assessment</text><text start="180.27" dur="5.4">some of the things that could go pretty</text><text start="182.25" dur="5.01">badly if we don&apos;t respond well not</text><text start="185.67" dur="3.36">because that is definitely how it&apos;s</text><text start="187.26" dur="3.71">going to go but because it could go that</text><text start="189.03" dur="4.2">way if we don&apos;t respond preventatively</text><text start="190.97" dur="4.09">now this is a tricky thing anytime</text><text start="193.23" dur="5.43">someone is in the position of trying to</text><text start="195.06" dur="6.12">do an anticipatory response is that it</text><text start="198.66" dur="4.89">is the job in doing anticipatory risk</text><text start="201.18" dur="4.25">mitigation to assess the scenarios we</text><text start="203.55" dur="4.38">don&apos;t want to have happen to propose</text><text start="205.43" dur="4.779">remedies to prevent them from happening</text><text start="207.93" dur="4.29">then people who have status quo bias</text><text start="210.209" dur="3.871">afterwards will say see it was overblown</text><text start="212.22" dur="3.239">hype those things didn&apos;t happen but they</text><text start="214.08" dur="5.85">only didn&apos;t happen because we made the</text><text start="215.459" dur="7.53">responses so the the scenarios I&apos;m gonna</text><text start="219.93" dur="6.45">suggest hopefully don&apos;t happen but they</text><text start="222.989" dur="5.101">could and in order to not happen they</text><text start="226.38" dur="3.63">need us to take them seriously and</text><text start="228.09" dur="3.63">respond in a way that prevents them and</text><text start="230.01" dur="3.81">then after the fact we&apos;ll say see look</text><text start="231.72" dur="4.769">they didn&apos;t happen because we responded</text><text start="233.82" dur="5.94">well so this is a really key aspect of</text><text start="236.489" dur="4.921">bias that&apos;s important now we have a</text><text start="239.76" dur="3.57">situation where we have to act without</text><text start="241.41" dur="3.75">complete knowledge the time that it</text><text start="243.33" dur="3.75">takes to get complete knowledge the</text><text start="245.16" dur="4.41">underlying situation is changing so</text><text start="247.08" dur="4.56">inaction is also a kind of action right</text><text start="249.57" dur="4.61">there is a consequence to action and</text><text start="251.64" dur="6.069">inaction and the action is not</text><text start="254.18" dur="7.22">inconsequential no matter what</text><text start="257.709" dur="5.671">doing nationwide quarantines has an a</text><text start="261.4" dur="4.68">massive effect on people&apos;s mental health</text><text start="263.38" dur="5.55">on the underlying economy on lots of</text><text start="266.08" dur="5.73">things and not doing it has a massive</text><text start="268.93" dur="4.41">effect and so we&apos;re not taking any of</text><text start="271.81" dur="4.32">that trivially trivially what we&apos;re</text><text start="273.34" dur="5.19">gonna do is given what the unknowns are</text><text start="276.13" dur="5.37">and what the knowns are what are the</text><text start="278.53" dur="4.56">various scenarios factoring the second</text><text start="281.5" dur="3.06">and third and fourth order effects how</text><text start="283.09" dur="3.99">bad do they get and what are the</text><text start="284.56" dur="5.04">responsible approaches to take that</text><text start="287.08" dur="4.53">maintain optionality for us to continue</text><text start="289.6" dur="3.75">to make better responses as we get</text><text start="291.61" dur="5.369">better information and as we get better</text><text start="293.35" dur="8.789">capabilities that&apos;s it for the preface</text><text start="296.979" dur="12.481">so diving into situational assessment I</text><text start="302.139" dur="10.741">think many people have a clearer sense</text><text start="309.46" dur="7.35">of the real risk here than they had even</text><text start="312.88" dur="6.69">a couple days ago because the awareness</text><text start="316.81" dur="6.87">of the actual risk portended is getting</text><text start="319.57" dur="5.34">clearer in terms of obviously the US</text><text start="323.68" dur="3.299">government and the UK government</text><text start="324.91" dur="4.95">starting to change their position the</text><text start="326.979" dur="5.281">paper that came out from the Imperial</text><text start="329.86" dur="5.61">College affected the positions of both</text><text start="332.26" dur="4.32">of those countries from let&apos;s just kind</text><text start="335.47" dur="3.93">of let everybody get it herd immunity</text><text start="336.58" dur="4.23">type approaches to oath that actually</text><text start="339.4" dur="3.21">it&apos;s gonna be catastrophic and won&apos;t</text><text start="340.81" dur="5.88">work and we have to be serious about</text><text start="342.61" dur="8.19">social distancing and quarantine there</text><text start="346.69" dur="6.9">are still a lot of people who think that</text><text start="350.8" dur="5.429">the risk of quarantine is worse than the</text><text start="353.59" dur="5.549">risk of not and that the viral risk</text><text start="356.229" dur="4.651">itself is overblown and that&apos;s one of</text><text start="359.139" dur="7.941">the things that I want to address so</text><text start="360.88" dur="9.87">we&apos;ll start right there so comparing the</text><text start="367.08" dur="5.05">death rates to the flu and seeing that a</text><text start="370.75" dur="2.88">lot less people have died and then</text><text start="372.13" dur="4.289">thinking that it&apos;s overblown and it&apos;s</text><text start="373.63" dur="5.159">some kind of either state agenda to</text><text start="376.419" dur="5.37">concentrate control or mass hysteria or</text><text start="378.789" dur="5.951">something like that a number of people</text><text start="381.789" dur="4.871">that die from the flu every year</text><text start="384.74" dur="3.78">is one it&apos;s a baseline that we always</text><text start="386.66" dur="3.569">have so looking at elevation from</text><text start="388.52" dur="4.47">baseline is a critical factor because</text><text start="390.229" dur="6.601">that&apos;s changing a the way that society</text><text start="392.99" dur="5.34">functions - because it&apos;s a baseline</text><text start="396.83" dur="3.72">we&apos;ve had every year we have ICU</text><text start="398.33" dur="4.11">capability for that we don&apos;t have ICU</text><text start="400.55" dur="2.82">capability for spikes above that and</text><text start="402.44" dur="2.58">that&apos;s where we start getting</text><text start="403.37" dur="5.359">catastrophic collapse of the medical</text><text start="405.02" dur="7.76">system that leads to much worse problems</text><text start="408.729" dur="6.28">3 during a flu season most people get it</text><text start="412.78" dur="4.449">very high percentage people get it</text><text start="415.009" dur="5.071">because we don&apos;t try to stop the spread</text><text start="417.229" dur="4.53">because it&apos;s not that fatal not not that</text><text start="420.08" dur="3.209">high a percentage of total people died</text><text start="421.759" dur="4.051">not that high percentage of people even</text><text start="423.289" dur="5.03">need hospitalized so we don&apos;t take very</text><text start="425.81" dur="6.359">serious measures to prevent it spread so</text><text start="428.319" dur="7.481">if a similar number of people got Kove</text><text start="432.169" dur="6.481">in nineteen as got the flu the death</text><text start="435.8" dur="5.01">numbers would be catastrophic higher</text><text start="438.65" dur="4.29">because the percentage of people that</text><text start="440.81" dur="3.389">need hospitalized and go into critical</text><text start="442.94" dur="3.629">condition and the percentage of people</text><text start="444.199" dur="5.511">that died even factoring the whole range</text><text start="446.569" dur="5.88">of what that can be is radically higher</text><text start="449.71" dur="5.199">the total number of people exposed so</text><text start="452.449" dur="3.69">far is tiny compared to the flu but it</text><text start="454.909" dur="3.211">won&apos;t stay tiny if you don&apos;t do</text><text start="456.139" dur="3.09">containment it is spreading enough that</text><text start="458.12" dur="3.06">if you don&apos;t contain it</text><text start="459.229" dur="4.711">you could get saturation you&apos;d get</text><text start="461.18" dur="5.66">saturation in about two months meaning a</text><text start="463.94" dur="5.43">60 70 percent of the population has it</text><text start="466.84" dur="4.329">globally from where we currently are if</text><text start="469.37" dur="3.99">containment efforts didn&apos;t get put in</text><text start="471.169" dur="5.22">place containment efforts can of course</text><text start="473.36" dur="4.26">slow that curve and even stop the curve</text><text start="476.389" dur="3.78">depending upon the nature of the</text><text start="477.62" dur="3.96">containment which will make the total</text><text start="480.169" dur="3.631">number of infected people and thus</text><text start="481.58" dur="8.7">hospitalized people and deaths much much</text><text start="483.8" dur="8.28">lower also in calculating fatalities it</text><text start="490.28" dur="3.81">takes a while from the time that someone</text><text start="492.08" dur="3.75">is exposed for them to expose other</text><text start="494.09" dur="2.879">people and expose other people to get to</text><text start="495.83" dur="2.97">who the people who are going to be most</text><text start="496.969" dur="3.301">vulnerable it takes a while from the</text><text start="498.8" dur="3.69">time someone was exposed for them to</text><text start="500.27" dur="3.899">show symptoms from the time they show</text><text start="502.49" dur="3.6">symptoms to get serious enough to go to</text><text start="504.169" dur="4.261">the hospital and from the time they go</text><text start="506.09" dur="4.889">to the hospital to when they die so</text><text start="508.43" dur="4.56">there&apos;s a lot of people who are early in</text><text start="510.979" dur="5.131">that curve who are not yet being</text><text start="512.99" dur="6.63">recorded as fatalities but will</text><text start="516.11" dur="6.33">and so comparing the fatalities right</text><text start="519.62" dur="6.5">now to the flu is like a whole bunch of</text><text start="522.44" dur="3.68">statistical mistakes at once</text><text start="526.24" dur="5.71">that&apos;s just one important thing to</text><text start="529.37" dur="6.63">factor if if you got two that say 60 70</text><text start="531.95" dur="6.42">percent infection rate as you get with</text><text start="536.0" dur="4.5">the flu what just a comparison what</text><text start="538.37" dur="4.77">would the death rate be there&apos;s a few</text><text start="540.5" dur="5.339">numbers that really matter it are not in</text><text start="543.14" dur="4.77">CF are the two then most people are</text><text start="545.839" dur="3.421">focusing or not as each person that gets</text><text start="547.91" dur="4.35">it how many other people will get it</text><text start="549.26" dur="4.5">from them and CFR&apos;s case fatality rate</text><text start="552.26" dur="5.819">of the total people who are infected how</text><text start="553.76" dur="6.63">many died the other number that I think</text><text start="558.079" dur="4.141">is critically important that is not</text><text start="560.39" dur="3.21">quite as popular being tracked is of the</text><text start="562.22" dur="3.48">total number of people who get it how</text><text start="563.6" dur="4.83">many need hospitalized how many have to</text><text start="565.7" dur="7.71">go to ICU that ends up being really</text><text start="568.43" dur="7.409">critical because of the much larger</text><text start="573.41" dur="5.549">percentage that are hospitalized than</text><text start="575.839" dur="4.351">died the downstream effects of that are</text><text start="578.959" dur="4.231">very profound and they have to factor</text><text start="580.19" dur="5.579">them all three of those numbers are</text><text start="583.19" dur="5.329">variables they are not fixed just by the</text><text start="585.769" dur="5.701">nature of the virus themselves so</text><text start="588.519" dur="5.32">they&apos;re very affected by the social</text><text start="591.47" dur="5.9">response social and institutional</text><text start="593.839" dur="6.36">response so regarding the are not number</text><text start="597.37" dur="5.589">when we say the are not is two or</text><text start="600.199" dur="4.89">two-and-a-half or whatever it is this is</text><text start="602.959" dur="4.32">a statistical average first it&apos;s a guess</text><text start="605.089" dur="3.511">based on not knowing the actual number</text><text start="607.279" dur="2.941">of infected cases because we aren&apos;t</text><text start="608.6" dur="5.46">testing enough to know the actual number</text><text start="610.22" dur="5.489">of infected cases and it&apos;s an average</text><text start="614.06" dur="3.6">across people who stay at home and don&apos;t</text><text start="615.709" dur="3.931">interact with anyone and people who are</text><text start="617.66" dur="4.619">writing the subway and interacting with</text><text start="619.64" dur="5.1">everyone and are in a lot of contact and</text><text start="622.279" dur="4.8">would be what we call super spreaders so</text><text start="624.74" dur="4.26">someone might infect a thousand people</text><text start="627.079" dur="5.841">and someone else might infect no people</text><text start="629.0" dur="6.6">right so averages are very misleading</text><text start="632.92" dur="5.77">because someone can say okay two and a</text><text start="635.6" dur="4.859">half people for me but particularly</text><text start="638.69" dur="4.32">young healthy people who don&apos;t think</text><text start="640.459" dur="4.171">they&apos;re at risk of dying and so they&apos;re</text><text start="643.01" dur="3.54">like I can take a risk of getting this</text><text start="644.63" dur="3.2">more than I can fake the risk of missing</text><text start="646.55" dur="3.95">making money or whatever</text><text start="647.83" dur="5.58">is might continue to and especially if</text><text start="650.5" dur="5.13">they stay because of being relatively</text><text start="653.41" dur="3.989">healthy low symptom for a very long</text><text start="655.63" dur="4.32">period of time while being infectious</text><text start="657.399" dur="6.961">they could be super spreaders to a lot</text><text start="659.95" dur="5.91">of people so it&apos;s important oh the other</text><text start="664.36" dur="4.86">thing with regard to or not that we have</text><text start="665.86" dur="5.34">to understand is it&apos;s so obviously</text><text start="669.22" dur="3.929">that&apos;s averaged and some people will</text><text start="671.2" dur="3.99">spread much more than others but also</text><text start="673.149" dur="5.19">this topic of portal pathways being able</text><text start="675.19" dur="5.16">to spread it to a critically sensitive</text><text start="678.339" dur="3.661">community or spread it to other people</text><text start="680.35" dur="3.81">who will become super spreaders or who</text><text start="682.0" dur="4.5">would have otherwise been unaffected so</text><text start="684.16" dur="3.63">it&apos;s not it&apos;s not just like how many</text><text start="686.5" dur="3.39">people did you spread it to but did you</text><text start="687.79" dur="4.26">spread it somewhere that actually is a</text><text start="689.89" dur="6.65">really big deal getting there versus not</text><text start="692.05" dur="6.81">getting there so for instance vulnerable</text><text start="696.54" dur="5.799">populations like senior living</text><text start="698.86" dur="6.39">facilities the death rate is also</text><text start="702.339" dur="5.161">averaged across populations who mostly</text><text start="705.25" dur="6.329">all won&apos;t die versus that have very high</text><text start="707.5" dur="6.87">mortality rates so the mortality rate</text><text start="711.579"

let&apos;s say one of</text><text start="719.26" dur="5.13">the workers who&apos;s going in there whether</text><text start="720.85" dur="5.13">it is a nurse or a janitor or whatever</text><text start="724.39" dur="2.759">is infected they don&apos;t know that they&apos;re</text><text start="725.98" dur="3.54">infected because there&apos;s not enough</text><text start="727.149" dur="6.661">testing they&apos;re asymptomatic it spreads</text><text start="729.52" dur="6.29">in there the fatality can that workers</text><text start="733.81" dur="8.73">from that would be very profound</text><text start="735.81" dur="10.42">if a worker goes into a prison or into a</text><text start="742.54" dur="5.88">homeless facility or into doing social</text><text start="746.23" dur="6.78">care work in Skid Row in a major</text><text start="748.42" dur="7.859">homeless area if those areas could be</text><text start="753.01" dur="6.15">totally quarantined right now and</text><text start="756.279" dur="4.8">protected from getting in we&apos;d be much</text><text start="759.16" dur="3.989">much better off because if they get it</text><text start="761.079" dur="3.541">it&apos;s extraordinarily hard to prevent it</text><text start="763.149" dur="5.19">from spreading and when we already don&apos;t</text><text start="764.62" dur="6.24">have enough intubation equipment and ICU</text><text start="768.339" dur="6.391">capabilities those aren&apos;t the first</text><text start="770.86" dur="5.64">places it&apos;s going to go so we have to</text><text start="774.73" dur="4.68">factor not just super spreaders but</text><text start="776.5" dur="5.07">portal pathways research patient 31 in</text><text start="779.41" dur="3.84">South Korea South Korea basically had</text><text start="781.57" dur="4.98">contained and one person who wasn&apos;t</text><text start="783.25" dur="5.16">contained was in lots of social</text><text start="786.55" dur="3.27">connection and all of the other cases</text><text start="788.41" dur="6.599">that happen they&apos;re believed to have</text><text start="789.82" dur="6.78">occurred from that one person so yeah</text><text start="795.009" dur="3.56">this is a place where we&apos;re not just</text><text start="796.6" dur="4.469">factoring ourselves we&apos;re factoring the</text><text start="798.569" dur="6.371">spread and the civic responsibility</text><text start="801.069" dur="6.151">associated with it so the infection rate</text><text start="804.94" dur="5.699">is a massive variable and we can change</text><text start="807.22" dur="5.4">it that&apos;s the first thing the number of</text><text start="810.639" dur="5.31">people or the percentage of people who</text><text start="812.62" dur="6.06">get infected who have to go to the</text><text start="815.949" dur="4.681">hospital is a massive variable and who</text><text start="818.68" dur="3.719">died it&apos;s a massive variable so we see</text><text start="820.63" dur="4.23">that the death rate the fatality rate</text><text start="822.399" dur="6.81">and none of these numbers are perfect</text><text start="824.86" dur="6.899">because this is total cases in ratio to</text><text start="829.209" dur="4.471">the death cases but we don&apos;t have total</text><text start="831.759" dur="4.111">cases right anywhere because we&apos;re not</text><text start="833.68" dur="4.5">doing enough testing anywhere and the</text><text start="835.87" dur="5.13">countries aren&apos;t doing similar types and</text><text start="838.18" dur="6.029">amounts of testing so the statistics are</text><text start="841.0" dur="5.16">getting misleading but it looks like the</text><text start="844.209" dur="3.661">best numbers or say in South Korea and</text><text start="846.16" dur="5.28">the worst numbers or say in Iran or</text><text start="847.87" dur="5.219">Italy in terms of fatality so South</text><text start="851.44" dur="3.69">Korea&apos;s got like a point five percent</text><text start="853.089" dur="4.531">fatality of the total number of people</text><text start="855.13" dur="4.079">to get it less than half a percent or</text><text start="857.62" dur="3.93">around a half a percent maybe up to</text><text start="859.209" dur="5.161">about a percent die whereas you might</text><text start="861.55" dur="4.289">have like five six seven percent</text><text start="864.37" dur="5.149">depending upon how we factor the</text><text start="865.839" dur="3.68">statistics dying in some other places</text><text start="869.97" dur="5.44">partly this is going to have to do with</text><text start="872.91" dur="4.27">the susceptibility of the communities</text><text start="875.41" dur="3.45">that are getting hit obviously Seattle</text><text start="877.18" dur="4.62">had a very high case fatality rate</text><text start="878.86" dur="4.5">because it had senior from a senior home</text><text start="881.8" dur="4.5">to begin with right so that&apos;s going to</text><text start="883.36" dur="6.539">start high but it&apos;s also very much the</text><text start="886.3" dur="5.94">result of the response so if you do</text><text start="889.899" dur="4.29">early Diagnostics not only can you do</text><text start="892.24" dur="4.23">smart containment and prevent the spread</text><text start="894.189" dur="4.71">you can start early treatment and early</text><text start="896.47" dur="6.299">treatment means that the chance of</text><text start="898.899" dur="7.471">severe infection is going to go down</text><text start="902.769" dur="5.731">radically so this is a novel virus</text><text start="906.37" dur="5.55">meaning it&apos;s not a previous human virus</text><text start="908.5" dur="5.16">and so we don&apos;t have innate immunity to</text><text start="911.92" dur="3.44">it and we don&apos;t already have developed</text><text start="913.66" dur="4.099">either vaccines or drug treat</text><text start="915.36" dur="4.169">but we&apos;re obviously the whole world is</text><text start="917.759" dur="5.19">mobilizing on its learning curve as fast</text><text start="919.529" dur="4.951">as possible so it was found out that</text><text start="922.949" dur="4.26">chloroquine seems effective</text><text start="924.48" dur="3.99">hydroxychloroquine seems more effective</text><text start="927.209" dur="3.151">with less side effects the</text><text start="928.47" dur="4.44">hydroxychloroquine is a thorough myosin</text><text start="930.36" dur="4.439">combo is looking quite effective but</text><text start="932.91" dur="3.63">it&apos;s not inconsequential there&apos;s</text><text start="934.799" dur="6.33">retinopathy effects there&apos;s heart</text><text start="936.54" dur="6.209">effects so there&apos;s also limited supply</text><text start="941.129" dur="3.541">of hydroxychloroquine there&apos;s already</text><text start="942.749" dur="3.63">people who depend upon that med to live</text><text start="944.67" dur="4.139">who have lupus who are having a hard</text><text start="946.379" dur="4.32">time getting in which then starts to</text><text start="948.809" dur="6.33">cause death from other reasons right or</text><text start="950.699" dur="7.89">um not just death but hospitalization</text><text start="955.139" dur="5.16">and health issues and whatever there&apos;s</text><text start="958.589" dur="3.0">research being done on lots of</text><text start="960.299" dur="3.931">antivirals that are looking promising</text><text start="961.589" dur="6.03">and on cytokine inhibitors and on ACE -</text><text start="964.23" dur="6.0">modulators on plasma antibody transfers</text><text start="967.619" dur="4.08">so I don&apos;t think the world has ever had</text><text start="970.23" dur="4.409">a situation where we medically learned</text><text start="971.699" dur="5.55">as fast as is happening now this is</text><text start="974.639" dur="4.8">another reason to want to slow the curve</text><text start="977.249" dur="4.77">radically because we are much less well</text><text start="979.439" dur="5.55">prepared today than we will be each day</text><text start="982.019" dur="6.3">that passes for dealing with us as we&apos;re</text><text start="984.989" dur="4.85">learning more but already a lot of</text><text start="988.319" dur="3.541">doctors are treating with</text><text start="989.839" dur="3.55">hydroxychloroquine and as a thorough</text><text start="991.86" dur="3.659">myosin and other things like that and</text><text start="993.389" dur="3.36">even just getting on fluids and but</text><text start="995.519" dur="3.57">let&apos;s say that you get a treat with</text><text start="996.749" dur="4.111">those drugs early on most of those</text><text start="999.089" dur="3.3">people won&apos;t have to go to the ICU even</text><text start="1000.86" dur="5.909">the same people that would have had to</text><text start="1002.389" dur="5.94">go to the ICU otherwise and many of the</text><text start="1006.769" dur="3.51">people that will have to go to the</text><text start="1008.329" dur="5.521">hospital won&apos;t need intubated and won&apos;t</text><text start="1010.279" dur="5.881">die and so early diagnostics and early</text><text start="1013.85" dur="4.76">treatment also change the curve of the</text><text start="1016.16" dur="5.369">illness for people who do get infected</text><text start="1018.61" dur="4.419">also early diagnostics changes the curve</text><text start="1021.529" dur="6.24">of how many other people they in fact</text><text start="1023.029" dur="8.01">right so you can have a situation where</text><text start="1027.769" dur="5.581">a very high percentage of the total</text><text start="1031.039" dur="5.341">population who gets infected will end up</text><text start="1033.35" dur="4.89">having to go to the ICU right like 20%</text><text start="1036.38" dur="3.419">of the population you could have a</text><text start="1038.24" dur="4.199">situation where almost nobody has to go</text><text start="1039.799" dur="4.02">to the ICU because we&apos;re testing of</text><text start="1042.439" dur="3.24">aquit ously and getting good treatments</text><text start="1043.819" dur="3.84">to people so it&apos;s important to</text><text start="1045.679" dur="3.741">understand how variable that is and the</text><text start="1047.659" dur="5.4">same with death rates</text><text start="1049.42" dur="5.259">it is not true that this is only a</text><text start="1053.059" dur="4.951">serious illness for old people with</text><text start="1054.679" dur="5.191">comorbidities it is mostly only fatal</text><text start="1058.01" dur="6.27">for people who are older or have</text><text start="1059.87" dur="6.24">comorbidities so far but half of the</text><text start="1064.28" dur="4.32">people in Italy who are on intubation</text><text start="1066.11" dur="6.09">which means a tube in your lungs keeping</text><text start="1068.6" dur="6.3">you alive are under 60 half of them are</text><text start="1072.2" dur="4.92">and if they didn&apos;t have access to that</text><text start="1074.9" dur="4.35">equipment then they wouldn&apos;t stay alive</text><text start="1077.12" dur="4.32">many of them and so it&apos;s important to</text><text start="1079.25" dur="3.87">understand that part of why the fatality</text><text start="1081.44" dur="3.75">rates are lower is because they&apos;re</text><text start="1083.12" dur="3.63">depending upon life support systems that</text><text start="1085.19" dur="3.15">if those life support systems went out</text><text start="1086.75" dur="3.09">the fatality would go way up</text><text start="1088.34" dur="3.41">now Italy&apos;s already gone to this</text><text start="1089.84" dur="4.14">situation where they don&apos;t have enough</text><text start="1091.75" dur="3.85">respirators and ICU capability for</text><text start="1093.98" dur="3.57">everyone so there triaging and so some</text><text start="1095.6" dur="4.14">people are just being led to die because</text><text start="1097.55" dur="4.08">they don&apos;t have any other options so</text><text start="1099.74" dur="3.569">then the death percentage goes way up</text><text start="1101.63" dur="2.88">right that&apos;s the single biggest thing</text><text start="1103.309" dur="2.791">that affects the percentage of people</text><text start="1104.51" dur="6.18">that die is the overwhelm of ICU</text><text start="1106.1" dur="6.87">capabilities and then people can&apos;t get</text><text start="1110.69" dur="6.119">treated for coronavirus and so they die</text><text start="1112.97" dur="5.55">also you can have a situation where the</text><text start="1116.809" dur="3.091">hospital is overwhelmed so people can&apos;t</text><text start="1118.52" dur="2.76">get treated for the normal stuff where</text><text start="1119.9" dur="3.24">we save people&apos;s lives from heart</text><text start="1121.28" dur="3.6">attacks and strokes and ambulances are</text><text start="1123.14" dur="3.36">taking a long time to get to places and</text><text start="1124.88" dur="8.49">bleeding looms and all those other</text><text start="1126.5" dur="9.45">things so it&apos;s important to understand</text><text start="1133.37" dur="4.26">that all of those numbers regarding the</text><text start="1135.95" dur="3.0">spread of the infection the number of</text><text start="1137.63" dur="3.06">people to get hospitalized the number of</text><text start="1138.95" dur="2.729">people that die are all variable we can</text><text start="1140.69" dur="2.55">change all of them and the</text><text start="1141.679" dur="3.691">recommendations we&apos;re going to share or</text><text start="1143.24" dur="4.05">how to make those numbers lower but</text><text start="1145.37" dur="3.66">those numbers can all go radically high</text><text start="1147.29" dur="3.12">if we don&apos;t respond appropriately we</text><text start="1149.03" dur="3.51">could have a spread all the way to</text><text start="1150.41" dur="4.44">saturation we could overwhelm the ICU</text><text start="1152.54" dur="4.26">Ziff where we will if that happens the</text><text start="1154.85" dur="4.05">death rate goes very high that&apos;s not to</text><text start="1156.8" dur="4.8">mention yet what the follow-on effects</text><text start="1158.9" dur="4.44">on the infrastructure and national</text><text start="1161.6" dur="4.59">security and the economy and other</text><text start="1163.34" dur="8.07">things will be but just even factoring</text><text start="1166.19" dur="9.84">that so now should we get into secondary</text><text start="1171.41" dur="6.03">effects sure yep so this much has not</text><text start="1176.03" dur="2.73">been clear to everyone it&apos;s still not</text><text start="1177.44" dur="2.599">clear to everyone but it&apos;s starting to</text><text start="1178.76" dur="3.529">get clearer</text><text start="1180.039" dur="3.421">and you had someone on the other day</text><text start="1182.289" dur="3.99">who&apos;s written some really brilliant</text><text start="1183.46" dur="6.809">articles on these things PO a said his</text><text start="1186.279" dur="8.4">name Thomas boy oh yes oh yeah yeah read</text><text start="1190.269"

next step we</text><text start="1199.119" dur="4.53">have to look at is let&apos;s say that we</text><text start="1201.19" dur="4.819">look at the health effects on people as</text><text

so</text><text start="1221.08" dur="5.13">as far as herd immunity type questions</text><text start="1223.84" dur="6.48">we do not know enough to be able to make</text><text start="1226.21" dur="6.99">those assessments yet because and so</text><text start="1230.32" dur="6.989">again this is as of March 21st a few</text><text start="1233.2" dur="6.809">days from now we might know more there</text><text start="1237.309" dur="6.031">are cases injured in China and Japan of</text><text start="1240.009" dur="5.75">people who were diagnosed with kovat 19</text><text start="1243.34"

antibodies protect</text><text start="1372.89" dur="3.75">against even if they are protective is a</text><text start="1374.75" dur="3.72">question right so as we know with the</text><text start="1376.64" dur="3.63">Spanish flu situation it wasn&apos;t the</text><text start="1378.47" dur="2.93">first round that killed the most people</text><text start="1380.27" dur="5.0">it was the second round</text><text start="1381.4" dur="7.0">so let&apos;s even say we got hurt immunity</text><text start="1385.27" dur="6.22">we know that we don&apos;t get hurt immunity</text><text start="1388.4" dur="4.95">against the flu permanently it every</text><text start="1391.49" dur="3.12">year kills a bunch more people right and</text><text start="1393.35" dur="2.76">we know that even if we vaccinate</text><text start="1394.61" dur="3.96">against that the vaccine is not good</text><text start="1396.11" dur="4.62">against the mutation so we have a</text><text start="1398.57" dur="3.96">similar situation here let&apos;s say that we</text><text start="1400.73" dur="3.45">didn&apos;t control this adequately and it&apos;s</text><text start="1402.53" dur="4.41">with us every year like the flu now but</text><text start="1404.18" dur="4.17">on top of the flu but with a much higher</text><text start="1406.94" dur="5.49">fatality and it reaches saturation</text><text start="1408.35" dur="7.59">numbers then we could look at this being</text><text start="1412.43" dur="7.16">a meaningfully population decreasing</text><text start="1415.94" dur="6.15">phenomena so let&apos;s say you get to</text><text start="1419.59" dur="5.44">saturation 70% of the people are</text><text start="1422.09" dur="4.86">infected and 2% of them die or because</text><text start="1425.03" dur="5.64">70% are infected and it overwhelms the</text><text start="1426.95" dur="6.06">IC use 5% of the people die calculate</text><text start="1430.67" dur="4.44">those on country-by-country basis or</text><text start="1433.01" dur="6.33">global basis those are tremendously huge</text><text start="1435.11" dur="6.18">numbers right so that&apos;s a there are</text><text start="1439.34" dur="3.99">numbers like 1 million there&apos;s numbers</text><text start="1441.29" dur="3.19">like 10 million in the US based on</text><text start="1443.33" dur="2.89">exactly how</text><text start="1444.48" dur="4.8">what the death rates are and how those</text><text start="1446.22" dur="4.65">curves happen but there I think the</text><text start="1449.28" dur="3.87">number of soldiers that died in Vietnam</text><text start="1450.87" dur="4.98">over 11 years was 50,000 or something</text><text start="1453.15" dur="7.71">like that so you can look at the</text><text start="1455.85" dur="7.47">multiples we&apos;re looking at so we don&apos;t</text><text start="1460.86" dur="5.069">yet know about whether immunity will be</text><text start="1463.32" dur="4.59">adequately conferred we don&apos;t yet know</text><text start="1465.929" dur="3.99">about the rate and the severity of the</text><text start="1467.91" dur="8.639">mutations and if the following mutations</text><text start="1469.919" dur="8.821">will be more or less lethal we don&apos;t yet</text><text start="1476.549" dur="5.75">know what the long-term health effects</text><text start="1478.74" dur="6.36">of contracting this are so we know that</text><text start="1482.299" dur="5.411">viruses don&apos;t just go away permanently</text><text start="1485.1" dur="5.069">in many cases they go into chronic</text><text start="1487.71" dur="4.26">phases so someone gets her Peas and they</text><text start="1490.169" dur="3.841">can continue to get herpes right they</text><text start="1491.97" dur="4.41">get HPV warts and they can continue to</text><text start="1494.01" dur="5.669">get words and they can continue to</text><text start="1496.38" dur="6.36">become infectious when that happens we</text><text start="1499.679" dur="4.531">know that with other infections you get</text><text start="1502.74" dur="4.26">chickenpox you don&apos;t get again for a</text><text start="1504.21" dur="5.7">long time but then you get shingles and</text><text start="1507.0" dur="4.86">then for some things like say mono then</text><text start="1509.91" dur="3.84">you still have low-grade epstein-barr</text><text start="1511.86" dur="4.23">that can increase likelihoods for</text><text start="1513.75" dur="6.45">cancers and chronic fatigue syndrome and</text><text start="1516.09" dur="6.329">things like that so what are is is there</text><text start="1520.2" dur="4.05">going to be a chronic health implication</text><text start="1522.419" dur="3.571">of this in addition to the existing</text><text start="1524.25" dur="3.36">chronic viruses that are already part of</text><text start="1525.99" dur="6.0">the health care system this is again</text><text start="1527.61" dur="8.43">also a totally not known topic and then</text><text start="1531.99" dur="8.61">the people who get a serious illness but</text><text start="1536.04" dur="6.57">don&apos;t die the CT scans of their lungs</text><text start="1540.6" dur="3.87">show very serious damage to their lungs</text><text start="1542.61" dur="4.83">some of them are showing damage to the</text><text start="1544.47" dur="5.81">heart cardiomyopathy and other body</text><text start="1547.44" dur="5.7">systems so might there be lasting damage</text><text start="1550.28" dur="7.18">it affects the duration of that person&apos;s</text><text start="1553.14" dur="6.9">life even for people who and I mean not</text><text start="1557.46" dur="6.27">via the viral or immunological process</text><text start="1560.04" dur="6.03">but the tissue damage processes well we</text><text start="1563.73" dur="5.449">know that tissue damage is occurring of</text><text start="1566.07" dur="5.099">the type that normally is lasting</text><text start="1569.179" dur="3.581">obviously what that looks like two or</text><text start="1571.169" dur="5.041">three years later we don&apos;t yet know but</text><text start="1572.76" dur="5.31">that should all tell people that this is</text><text start="1576.21" dur="3.63">not something to take lightly</text><text start="1578.07" dur="4.89">and that there&apos;s a good bit of unknown</text><text start="1579.84" dur="5.4">also just look at a video of someone on</text><text start="1582.96" dur="5.7">intubation and who&apos;s got to be intubated</text><text start="1585.24" dur="5.67">for weeks like that&apos;s such an</text><text start="1588.66" dur="5.91">undesirable thing to experience even if</text><text start="1590.91" dur="4.98">it doesn&apos;t kill you and again back that</text><text start="1594.57" dur="5.04">half of the people in Italy on</text><text start="1595.89" dur="4.92">intubation are under 60 so that&apos;s a</text><text start="1599.61" dur="4.98">little bit more just on the medical</text><text start="1600.81" dur="6.09">effects right okay so let&apos;s say that</text><text start="1604.59" dur="5.54">that is all looking at kind of just the</text><text start="1606.9" dur="5.7">direct virus acting on human physiology</text><text start="1610.13" dur="4.54">so now we look at second-order effects</text><text start="1612.6" dur="6.36">and we say okay so what is the effect on</text><text start="1614.67" dur="6.21">the medical system from spikes well</text><text start="1618.96" dur="5.97">beyond the capacity of what I see use</text><text start="1620.88" dur="5.79">our setup for so it&apos;s expensive to run</text><text start="1624.93" dur="3.78">hospitals it&apos;s expensive to run</text><text start="1626.67" dur="3.42">intensive care units and to train lots</text><text start="1628.71" dur="4.13">of doctors and whatever to just be</text><text start="1630.09" dur="5.58">sitting around waiting for surges so</text><text start="1632.84" dur="5.32">hospitals and I see use run pretty close</text><text start="1635.67" dur="5.79">to full capacity for financial</text><text start="1638.16" dur="4.83">efficiency which means that really big</text><text start="1641.46" dur="4.17">surges are things that are not well</text><text start="1642.99" dur="4.92">prepared for some things can be</text><text start="1645.63" dur="4.68">upregulated fairly quickly some things</text><text start="1647.91" dur="4.71">can&apos;t like it&apos;s not very easy to build a</text><text start="1650.31" dur="5.81">lot more respirators in a hurry or to</text><text start="1652.62" dur="6.9">train a lot more doctors in a hurry so</text><text start="1656.12" dur="5.65">if the number of people who are going to</text><text start="1659.52" dur="5.25">I see use is within the capacity that</text><text start="1661.77" dur="5.22">the ICU can scale up to the death</text><text start="1664.77" dur="4.17">percentages will stay relatively low if</text><text start="1666.99" dur="3.6">it exceeds it and the I see us to start</text><text start="1668.94" dur="3.72">triaging who gets treated and who</text><text start="1670.59" dur="3.54">doesn&apos;t the number of deaths the</text><text start="1672.66" dur="5.49">percentage of deaths is going to go way</text><text start="1674.13" dur="6.15">up so let&apos;s say that the number of</text><text start="1678.15" dur="3.99">people that are going in is 2x what the</text><text start="1680.28" dur="3.96">ICU czar prepared for and they can get</text><text start="1682.14" dur="4.68">people in the hallways and whatever okay</text><text start="1684.24" dur="5.64">that&apos;s one thing but what if it&apos;s 10x or</text><text start="1686.82" dur="6.75">more this is where you start seeing what</text><text start="1689.88" dur="5.52">you&apos;re seeing in Italy and you know and</text><text start="1693.57" dur="5.4">worse where it&apos;s just people just can&apos;t</text><text start="1695.4" dur="5.58">be treated now besides the fact that</text><text start="1698.97" dur="4.08">most of the hospitals in the US are</text><text start="1700.98" dur="3.75">already running low on personal</text><text start="1703.05" dur="3.51">protective equipment or don&apos;t even have</text><text start="1704.73" dur="3.45">it and doctors are putting themselves</text><text start="1706.56" dur="3.13">and nurses putting themselves a huge</text><text start="1708.18" dur="3.52">personal risk</text><text start="1709.69" dur="3.78">rate of doctors and nurses getting sick</text><text start="1711.7" dur="3.69">is estimated at something like two to</text><text start="1713.47" dur="3.0">five x with the rate of everybody else&apos;s</text><text start="1715.39" dur="6.69">and they&apos;re the people who most</text><text start="1716.47" dur="7.62">critically can&apos;t get sick and there&apos;s</text><text start="1722.08" dur="3.87">not enough ICU beds there&apos;s not enough</text><text start="1724.09" dur="4.77">intubation equipment there&apos;s not enough</text><text start="1725.95" dur="8.19">of the tests of the hydroxychloroquine</text><text start="1728.86" dur="7.02">of whatever right very since doctor</text><text start="1734.14" dur="3.6">friend of mine in LA told me something</text><text start="1735.88" dur="4.68">like currently there&apos;s a hundred and</text><text start="1737.74" dur="5.22">fifty beds and ICU left in LA there&apos;s 10</text><text start="1740.56" dur="4.5">million people in LA and let&apos;s just look</text><text start="1742.96" dur="7.32">at what any percentage of saturation</text><text start="1745.06" dur="6.93">looks like and what any reasonable</text><text start="1750.28" dur="3.6">percentage of that having to go to ICU</text><text start="1751.99" dur="7.86">is and it&apos;s like oh that that can look</text><text start="1753.88" dur="7.95">terrible in a hurry ring so what happens</text><text start="1759.85" dur="5.16">if our doctors and nurses are getting</text><text start="1761.83" dur="4.65">sick and we saw a couple thousand health</text><text start="1765.01" dur="2.91">care workers and China gets that grade</text><text start="1766.48" dur="3.18">and China did a good job of containing</text><text start="1767.92" dur="3.51">it to one area which we haven&apos;t we now</text><text start="1769.66" dur="4.26">have cases in all 50 states they were</text><text start="1771.43" dur="5.55">able to mostly quarantine Hubei Province</text><text start="1773.92" dur="7.11">and Wuhan and have the spread outside</text><text start="1776.98" dur="9.57">much less but because of their drastic</text><text start="1781.03" dur="7.86">rapid intense response and also even if</text><text start="1786.55" dur="3.87">the doctors and nurses don&apos;t get sick</text><text start="1788.89" dur="3.36">just wearing them out because they&apos;re</text><text start="1790.42" dur="5.1">trying to save lives running so many</text><text start="1792.25" dur="7.08">shifts go look at the videos of people</text><text start="1795.52" dur="5.25">in ICU in Seattle in Italy and just kind</text><text start="1799.33" dur="4.11">of get a sense of what that looks like</text><text start="1800.77" dur="6.51">and read some of the letters that</text><text start="1803.44" dur="8.7">doctors in Italy are writing that are</text><text start="1807.28" dur="6.24">kind of sharing their experience so you</text><text start="1812.14" dur="5.07">start to have a collapse of the health</text><text start="1813.52" dur="7.35">care system and now this has all kinds</text><text start="1817.21" dur="5.61">of cascading consequences for death from</text><text start="1820.87" dur="4.29">all other kinds of things and chronic</text><text start="1822.82" dur="8.13">health implications and whatever alright</text><text start="1825.16" dur="8.55">next so let&apos;s say we try to institute a</text><text start="1830.95" dur="4.71">quarantine and people don&apos;t want to</text><text start="1833.71" dur="3.24">participate and so we have to have the</text><text start="1835.66" dur="3.3">National Guard and the police we&apos;re</text><text start="1836.95" dur="4.02">allowed to try to initiate it if you</text><text start="1838.96" dur="3.1">look at the videos from South Korea and</text><text start="1840.97" dur="4.54">China</text><text start="1842.06" dur="6.57">and Hong Kong you&apos;ll see that the police</text><text start="1845.51" dur="5.37">and the National Guard equivalents are</text><text start="1848.63" dur="3.9">all wearing hazmat gear and the doctors</text><text start="1850.88" dur="3.63">and the nurses and the people doing the</text><text start="1852.53" dur="4.71">sanitizing and picking up the trash are</text><text start="1854.51" dur="4.23">all in pretty intensive degrees of</text><text start="1857.24" dur="3.27">personal protective equipment and the</text><text start="1858.74" dur="6.51">very frontline high exposure ones are in</text><text start="1860.51" dur="7.08">hazmat gear to the best of my knowledge</text><text start="1865.25" dur="4.83">and pretty active communication about</text><text start="1867.59" dur="4.32">this neither the u.s. nor the UK have</text><text start="1870.08" dur="4.17">that much gear nor do they have the</text><text start="1871.91" dur="3.96">training to be able to get that to the</text><text start="1874.25" dur="5.31">frontline people that would need to have</text><text start="1875.87" dur="5.19">it so obviously we have to find where</text><text start="1879.56" dur="3.12">the surplus is get it to the most</text><text start="1881.06" dur="4.95">critical people in triage get the</text><text start="1882.68" dur="5.37">training up and produce more kind of</text><text start="1886.01" dur="3.51">instantly because one of the things</text><text start="1888.05" dur="3.87">you&apos;ll notice about many of those jobs</text><text start="1889.52" dur="4.17">is that they have very high contact with</text><text start="1891.92" dur="4.23">each other right police are riding in a</text><text start="1893.69" dur="3.15">truck together they&apos;re in a locker room</text><text start="1896.15" dur="4.19">together</text><text start="1896.84" dur="6.36">National Guard etc first responders and</text><text start="1900.34" dur="6.64">because of the long asymptomatic period</text><text start="1903.2" dur="5.4">2 to 21 days asymptomatic and some cases</text><text start="1906.98" dur="3.06">actually recover while being quite low</text><text start="1908.6" dur="3.9">symptoms so you can be spreading that</text><text start="1910.04" dur="5.76">entire time and we don&apos;t have you know</text><text start="1912.5" dur="5.34">testing out so what happens if a</text><text start="1915.8" dur="3.48">significant percentage of the police</text><text start="1917.84" dur="3.75">start to get sick or the National Guard</text><text start="1919.28" dur="4.68">or military or prison guards or the</text><text start="1921.59" dur="4.32">people who run the utilities the</text><text start="1923.96" dur="4.41">critical utilities or the supply chains</text><text start="1925.91" dur="4.29">you can start to get now here&apos;s the</text><text start="1928.37" dur="5.22">cascading kind of third order failures</text><text start="1930.2" dur="9.54">and these are much much worse risks than</text><text start="1933.59" dur="9.15">the virus right so obviously everyone</text><text start="1939.74" dur="4.41">can&apos;t go on quarantine because for most</text><text start="1942.74" dur="3.15">people to be able to stay home the</text><text start="1944.15" dur="3.45">electricity has to stay on and the water</text><text start="1945.89" dur="3.35">has to stay on the internet has to stay</text><text start="1947.6" dur="5.43">on they have to have some way that</text><text start="1949.24" dur="5.98">either the supermarket&apos;s have some</text><text start="1953.03" dur="3.81">triage version of staying open or</text><text start="1955.22" dur="3.9">delivery mechanisms happen the</text><text start="1956.84" dur="4.44">pharmacies so there&apos;s a number of people</text><text start="1959.12" dur="4.86">whose jobs are required to basically</text><text start="1961.28" dur="5.36">mediate societal function and not having</text><text start="1963.98" dur="5.85">societal collapse all of those people</text><text start="1966.64" dur="5.41">need to get personal protective</text><text start="1969.83" dur="4.17">equipment and/or hazmat gear based on</text><text start="1972.05" dur="2.54">the degree of exposure they have and</text><text start="1974.0" dur="2.27">they need</text><text start="1974.59" dur="4.23">to get training for how to use it and</text><text start="1976.27" dur="5.31">they need to have in Sherman of payments</text><text start="1978.82" dur="8.76">so they don&apos;t go on strike this is not</text><text start="1981.58" dur="9.449">the time we need or trash the people</text><text start="1987.58" dur="5.579">that do trash sanitization engineers</text><text start="1991.029" dur="4.311">getting sick or going on strike right</text><text start="1993.159" dur="4.77">we&apos;re then you start to get additional</text><text start="1995.34" dur="5.14">health plague type issues associated</text><text start="1997.929" dur="4.62">trash piling up or any critical</text><text start="2000.48" dur="6.51">utilities or whatever starting to have</text><text start="2002.549" dur="6.87">problems but that could happen right and</text><text start="2006.99" dur="4.65">we already see we saw in Italy certain</text><text start="2009.419" dur="4.531">prisons being overtaken by the prisoners</text><text start="2011.64" dur="3.539">because of this situation either because</text><text start="2013.95" dur="2.79">the prison guards didn&apos;t want to go to</text><text start="2015.179" dur="3.331">work or about sick or various things</text><text start="2016.74" dur="3.569">like that now the US has a much higher</text><text start="2018.51" dur="4.56">percentage of its total population in</text><text start="2020.309"

dur="5.04">season was like last year and think</text><text start="2094.98" dur="4.16">about okay so what happens where you got</text><text start="2096.659" dur="4.621">a quarantine then the wildfire start or</text><text start="2099.14" dur="5.56">Florida hurricane season or whatever</text><text start="2101.28" dur="5.67">right so we also have to think about the</text><text start="2104.7" dur="4.02">rest of general preparedness</text><text start="2106.95" dur="3.419">in those issues and where we started to</text><text start="2108.72" dur="3.569">get quarantined down and now we lose</text><text start="2110.369" dur="5.24">quarantine because of some other issue</text><text start="2112.289" dur="6.361">and or can&apos;t respond so we get worse</text><text start="2115.609" dur="4.45">death tolls or infrastructure collapse</text><text start="2118.65" dur="2.909">because our responders are already</text><text start="2120.059" dur="8.101">purposed somewhere else for sick or</text><text start="2121.559" dur="7.77">taxed or something like that right now</text><text start="2128.16" dur="4.439">we start to look at the political</text><text start="2129.329" dur="6.631">effects could we have a situation where</text><text start="2132.599" dur="7.46">the countries on quarantine during the</text><text start="2135.96" dur="6.659">elections for the US yeah do we have</text><text start="2140.059" dur="3.76">digital voting that is secure and ready</text><text start="2142.619" dur="3.75">to go where people can vote from at home</text><text start="2143.819" dur="3.45">no not currently and what it would take</text><text start="2146.369" dur="2.94">to get there</text><text start="2147.269" dur="3.931">we have no precedent for we also have no</text><text

and vote do we</text><text start="2159.9" dur="3.869">increase the pandemic spread and have a</text><text start="2161.88" dur="3.659">spike during that time and then you know</text><text start="2163.769" dur="4.981">have a whole additional spike to deal</text><text start="2165.539" dur="5.79">with does this change the demographics</text><text start="2168.75" dur="4.559">of who&apos;s available to go significantly</text><text start="2171.329" dur="8.551">so there&apos;s a whole big serious set of</text><text start="2173.309" dur="8.22">questions there obviously the economic</text><text start="2179.88" dur="3.51">situation we&apos;ve seen trillions of</text><text start="2181.529" dur="6.691">dollars of loss since this is started in</text><text start="2183.39" dur="7.429">the stock market and if you take for the</text><text start="2188.22" dur="7.2">US or the UK or any country or the world</text><text start="2190.819" dur="6.22">you take the GDP per month and you say</text><text start="2195.42" dur="4.639">okay under quarantine people are staying</text><text start="2197.039" dur="5.28">home we&apos;re not just looking at a</text><text start="2200.059" dur="3.76">effective asset classes because of</text><text start="2202.319" dur="5.69">trading and fear and whatever and we&apos;re</text><text start="2203.819" dur="4.19">not just looking at the effect of on</text><text start="2208.819" dur="8.681">Airlines and a few industries but all of</text><text start="2213.809" dur="6.06">the restaurants and all of the you know</text><text start="2217.5" dur="4.109">sporting and cruises and in-person type</text><text start="2219.869" dur="4.5">things small businesses everything under</text><text start="2221.609" dur="4.801">quarantine so we&apos;re looking at not just</text><text start="2224.369" dur="3.811">a effect on the financial sector but on</text><text start="2226.41" dur="4.139">the actual real economics of</text><text start="2228.18" dur="4.619">productivity itself and supply and</text><text start="2230.549" dur="5.341">demand type dynamics themselves so then</text><text start="2232.799" dur="5.401">we get what a decrease of by 30 percent</text><text start="2235.89" dur="3.51">under quarantine or forty percent or</text><text start="2238.2" dur="3.899">whatever of</text><text start="2239.4" dur="4.949">world GDP capacity so look at what the</text><text start="2242.099" dur="5.311">GDP of the US for instance per Montes</text><text start="2244.349" dur="4.891">look at losing 30 or 40 percent of that</text><text start="2247.41" dur="3.75">per month and the idea that that&apos;s what</text><text start="2249.24" dur="4.68">has to be subsidized just for break-even</text><text start="2251.16" dur="4.889">type effects not mentioning the up</text><text start="2253.92" dur="4.26">ramping I see use capabilities and</text><text start="2256.049" dur="5.131">diagnostic capabilities and things like</text><text start="2258.18" dur="5.429">that or international aid which brings</text><text start="2261.18" dur="3.96">us to the next topic there&apos;s a lot more</text><text start="2263.609" dur="3.871">in economics by the way seventy percent</text><text start="2265.14" dur="4.139">of Americans live paycheck to paycheck</text><text start="2267.48" dur="3.96">and can&apos;t afford to be quarantined for a</text><text start="2269.279" dur="4.471">while so they will push to want to keep</text><text start="2271.44" dur="4.169">working and you know spread infection</text><text start="2273.75" dur="3.539">for them to be able to stay home is</text><text start="2275.609" dur="3.18">gonna require economic support in</text><text start="2277.289" dur="3.091">stimulus packages which are already in</text><text start="2278.789" dur="4.8">discussion which is really good which</text><text start="2280.38" dur="7.32">should be suspension of rent and</text><text start="2283.589" dur="5.7">mortgage payments and either a ubi or</text><text start="2287.7" dur="5.97">some kind of food and medicine</text><text start="2289.289" dur="5.851">provisioning type capabilities there&apos;s</text><text start="2293.67" dur="3.03">going to need to be protection for small</text><text start="2295.14" dur="4.229">businesses so there doesn&apos;t have to be</text><text start="2296.7" dur="4.589">massive laying off of people because if</text><text start="2299.369" dur="3.99">you have bankruptcy and collapse of</text><text start="2301.289" dur="3.33">small businesses they can&apos;t rebuild</text><text start="2303.359" dur="2.521">themselves that quickly there&apos;s a</text><text start="2304.619" dur="3.24">learning group to be able to rebuild</text><text start="2305.88" dur="3.3">things so it&apos;s like you know when you&apos;re</text><text start="2307.859" dur="6.48">clear cut a forest you don&apos;t get a new</text><text start="2309.18" dur="8.52">forest back right away and so there&apos;s a</text><text start="2314.339" dur="6.571">lot in the economic space that has to be</text><text start="2317.7" dur="6.589">addressed the geopolitical space is</text><text start="2320.91" dur="6.75">actually where my biggest concerns are</text><text start="2324.289" dur="6.01">so I&apos;ll share a scenario it&apos;s not the</text><text start="2327.66" dur="5.73">only scenario so we see already Saudi</text><text start="2330.299" dur="6.421">Arabia doing and Russia in this you know</text><text start="2333.39" dur="4.86">oil price gouging kind of scenario and</text><text start="2336.72" dur="2.399">that could play out all kinds of weird</text><text start="2338.25" dur="2.599">ways so there&apos;s lots of different</text><text start="2339.119" dur="4.531">scenarios that could occur but let&apos;s</text><text start="2340.849" dur="7.631">specifically focus on us-china relations</text><text start="2343.65" dur="7.62">and overall geopolitical placement first</text><text start="2348.48" dur="4.799">let&apos;s look at what the epidemiology for</text><text start="2351.27" dur="6.42">the whole world could be because we</text><text start="2353.279" dur="6.83">don&apos;t know originally there was a hope</text><text start="2357.69" dur="5.07">that this would follow seasonality and</text><text start="2360.109" dur="4.841">either led up a bunch in the summer and</text><text start="2362.76" dur="5.039">or as a result of temperature effects</text><text start="2364.95" dur="4.919">not really hit one countries as much we</text><text start="2367.799" dur="3.101">now see it spreading rapidly in Brazil</text><text start="2369.869" dur="4.48">and in other</text><text start="2370.9" dur="5.969">warmer Asian places and so that hope has</text><text start="2374.349" dur="4.5">been kind of thwarted it looks like</text><text start="2376.869" dur="4.621">there are aren&apos;t any places that are</text><text start="2378.849" dur="4.47">unsusceptible so there are places that</text><text start="2381.49" dur="3.03">are earlier in the curve and later in</text><text start="2383.319" dur="4.47">the curve in some place that haven&apos;t</text><text start="2384.52" dur="5.19">been reached yet but unless some kind of</text><text start="2387.789" dur="4.591">massive measures are taken to not be</text><text start="2389.71" dur="6.149">reached and they will so specifically</text><text start="2392.38" dur="5.729">what happens when India gets hit China</text><text start="2395.859" dur="4.141">has a huge population but they didn&apos;t</text><text start="2398.109" dur="3.45">have to quarantine their whole</text><text start="2400.0" dur="2.94">population they had to do some measures</text><text start="2401.559" dur="2.97">across the whole population but they</text><text start="2402.94" dur="3.919">were able to contain to a province</text><text start="2404.529" dur="5.58">pretty strongly</text><text start="2406.859" dur="5.68">what is India do with very high total</text><text start="2410.109" dur="5.94">population very high population density</text><text start="2412.539" dur="6.57">very high interaction low ICU per capita</text><text start="2416.049" dur="5.101">capabilities low relative hygiene</text><text start="2419.109" dur="4.801">capabilities for lots of population and</text><text start="2421.15" dur="5.34">just imagine like okay if we don&apos;t</text><text start="2423.91" dur="5.97">protect against transmission there what</text><text start="2426.49" dur="5.52">happens same with Mexico City right same</text><text start="2429.88" dur="4.26">with Lagos same with a number of places</text><text start="2432.01" dur="4.89">Bangladesh that have high populations</text><text start="2434.14" dur="8.28">multiplied by population density without</text><text start="2436.9" dur="7.8">good preparedness capacities okay so now</text><text start="2442.42" dur="4.439">we see and we see that first world</text><text start="2444.7" dur="4.5">countries are getting destroyed right we</text><text start="2446.859" dur="5.101">see that Italy is in that position and</text><text start="2449.2" dur="5.82">and that other European countries right</text><text start="2451.96" dur="4.139">Merkel said probably 70 percent of the</text><text start="2455.02" dur="3.569">country is going to get infected</text><text start="2456.099" dur="3.96">eventually like the very serious kinds</text><text start="2458.589" dur="3.391">of things we see what&apos;s happening to the</text><text start="2460.059" dur="4.621">EU as a result of this since they use</text><text start="2461.98" dur="4.29">not actually supporting Italy and not</text><text start="2464.68" dur="3.48">able to support Eastern European</text><text start="2466.27" dur="4.68">countries and then China stepping in to</text><text start="2468.16" dur="5.369">offer help so now China was on the front</text><text start="2470.95" dur="4.919">of this curve which also and they took</text><text start="2473.529" dur="5.371">very strong responses so they are the</text><text start="2475.869" dur="5.371">farthest ahead of being able to offer</text><text start="2478.9" dur="3.929">international aid in response China was</text><text start="2481.24" dur="3.21">already the place that did most of the</text><text start="2482.829" dur="8.52">manufacturing of medical equipment in</text><text start="2484.45" dur="9.0">the first place and so in one way of</text><text start="2491.349" dur="4.19">looking at it and China got a massive</text><text start="2493.45" dur="3.78">economic hit and there were lots of</text><text start="2495.539" dur="3.28">companies that wanted to pull</text><text start="2497.23" dur="3.27">manufacturing out of China which could</text><text start="2498.819" dur="4.23">be a massive very long term head for</text><text start="2500.5" dur="3.17">China since exporters such a huge part</text><text start="2503.049" dur="2.54">of their business</text><text start="2503.67" dur="4.98">it affected overall you know public</text><text start="2505.589" dur="5.611">sentiment towards them so in some ways</text><text start="2508.65" dur="4.55">they got hit hard but on other ways you</text><text start="2511.2" dur="5.159">know it&apos;s just two months later and</text><text start="2513.2" dur="7.81">they&apos;re starting to loosen quarantine no</text><text start="2516.359" dur="6.181">new cases in Wuhan and they&apos;re opening</text><text start="2521.01" dur="3.68">Apple stores and Starbucks stores</text><text start="2522.54" dur="7.009">throughout the country again right plus</text><text start="2524.69" dur="8.2">offering masks and ventilators and</text><text start="2529.549" dur="4.961">training and aid and you know medical</text><text start="2532.89" dur="3.06">knowledge and equipment to places that</text><text start="2534.51" dur="2.37">need it so we&apos;ve seen that in Italy</text><text start="2535.95" dur="7.139">we&apos;ve seen in some Eastern European</text><text start="2536.88" dur="8.52">places we saw to the EU as a whole so in</text><text start="2543.089" dur="4.5">some ways China&apos;s in a stronger position</text><text start="2545.4" dur="4.77">than it&apos;s ever been because they&apos;re on</text><text start="2547.589" dur="5.911">the other side of this they mobilized</text><text start="2550.17" dur="5.76">into a crisis wartime response type mode</text><text start="2553.5" dur="4.29">and they have the Medical Response</text><text start="2555.93" dur="3.75">equipment and those types of things they</text><text start="2557.79" dur="3.93">were already geopolitically very savvy</text><text start="2559.68" dur="3.389">with the Belden Road initiative and all</text><text start="2561.72" dur="2.94">of the work they were doing to be able</text><text start="2563.069" dur="3.211">to get international support and</text><text start="2564.66" dur="5.58">coordination for their geopolitical</text><text start="2566.28" dur="6.93">agendas the u.s. appears to be moving</text><text start="2570.24" dur="7.8">into one of the weakest positions it has</text><text start="2573.21" dur="6.72">been in a very long time and because of</text><text start="2578.04" dur="3.75">not having early strong response and we</text><text start="2579.93" dur="3.21">can&apos;t just do specialized quarantines</text><text start="2581.79" dur="3.09">because there are some people in all 50</text><text start="2583.14" dur="3.09">states and we don&apos;t have the Diagnostics</text><text start="2584.88" dur="4.439">ready could we be in a very vulnerable</text><text start="2586.23" dur="5.19">position for a long time I&apos;ve heard UK</text><text start="2589.319" dur="4.05">and US federal governments both talked</text><text start="2591.42" dur="3.659">about 18 months now after the paper that</text><text start="2593.369" dur="7.051">came out from Imperial College talking</text><text start="2595.079" dur="6.75">about that so what happens if China is</text><text start="2600.42" dur="6.24">in a very strong position yes in a weak</text><text start="2601.829" dur="8.071">position and could they start dumping US</text><text start="2606.66" dur="5.37">Treasury bonds could they start with</text><text start="2609.9" dur="3.84">cyberattacks whatever not just them lots</text><text start="2612.03" dur="4.289">of state actors non-state actors right</text><text start="2613.74" dur="5.43">do we have if the police are redirected</text><text start="2616.319" dur="4.53">then where does that open up criminality</text><text start="2619.17" dur="3.3">if the government&apos;s attention is damaged</text><text start="2620.849" dur="5.881">or redirected where does that open up</text><text start="2622.47" dur="6.57">vulnerabilities that&apos;s obviously going</text><text start="2626.73" dur="4.29">to happen everywhere but there&apos;s not as</text><text start="2629.04" dur="3.99">many places in the world that would have</text><text start="2631.02" dur="4.259">predatory opportunism for Italy as</text><text start="2633.03" dur="5.1">they&apos;d have for the US right</text><text start="2635.279" dur="7.111">or the UK but particularly look at kind</text><text start="2638.13" dur="7.229">of superpower tensions here and but</text><text start="2642.39" dur="7.529">there&apos;s a thing that isn&apos;t direct war</text><text start="2645.359" dur="6.271">which is just China being able to do a</text><text start="2649.919" dur="3.42">good job of offering international aid</text><text start="2651.63" dur="3.899">in exchange for joining the Belden Road</text><text start="2653.339" dur="4.17">initiative and then oh by the way</text><text start="2655.529" dur="4.32">dollars are really dirty and

something</text><text start="2670.229" dur="3.36">that was being considered and in the</text><text start="2671.669" dur="3.51">works I was a turn on to this originally</text><text start="2673.589" dur="5.82">by Alex Gladstein from the human rights</text><text start="2675.179" dur="7.471">foundation that there&apos;s a bunch of</text><text start="2679.409" dur="5.46">countries that were already

dur="4.98">responses and the appropriate response</text><text start="3263.859" dur="3.391">right now is that even though we have</text><text start="3265.9" dur="4.709">people in all 50 states that

start="3655.9" dur="6.24">support all the people who can&apos;t be on</text><text start="3658.03" dur="5.94">quarantine need to have the personal</text><text start="3662.14" dur="3.54">protective gear

start="3667.99" dur="4.95">mentioned many of the areas but you know</text><text start="3670.9" dur="3.81">you can factor what those areas are</text><text start="3672.94" dur="7.44">healthcare first responders</text><text start="3674.71" dur="8.28">infrastructure utilities etc vulnerable</text><text start="3680.38" dur="4.5">populations particularly need very hard</text><text start="3682.99" dur="3.75">quarantine measures so the seniors</text><text start="3684.88" dur="4.98">facilities the prisons the homeless</text><text start="3686.74" dur="5.58">facilities the immuno compromised places</text><text start="3689.86" dur="5.52">those need very hard quarantines because</text><text start="3692.32" dur="3.52">we can&apos;t have spreading and yeah we</text><text start="3695.38" dur="1.84">can&apos;t</text><text start="3695.84" dur="4.47">we can&apos;t have spreading happening within</text><text start="3697.22" dur="5.01">those it&apos;ll be too much of a disaster

that it takes to make that happen</text><text start="3711.31" dur="7.57">the focus is a full-court press with the</text><text start="3717.41" dur="4.7">private sector and the government</text><text

all</text><text start="3742.22" dur="3.51">that&apos;s true on the tests that we&apos;ve had</text><text start="3743.96" dur="3.93">so when I&apos;m saying we need to ramp up</text><text start="3745.73" dur="7.56">Diagnostics adequate Diagnostics what I</text><text start="3747.89" dur="8.15">mean is it&apos;s not a single strategy we&apos;ve</text><text start="3753.29" dur="6.39">been collecting all of the diagnostic</text><text start="3756.04" dur="6.46">technology surplus new diagnostic tech</text><text start="3759.68" dur="4.5">in one place so that we can be seeing</text><text

start="3772.52" dur="7.65">can do that through facebook Messenger</text><text start="3775.96" dur="5.86">but so we need to get the tests that</text><text start="3780.17" dur="3.78">currently exists even though they&apos;re</text><text start="3781.82" dur="6.45">inadequate to all the places that need</text><text start="3783.95" dur="7.65">them most so a triage to the places</text><text start="3788.27" dur="6.87">where the most spread can occur right</text><text start="3791.6" dur="6.12">there the following tracing of contacted</text><text start="3795.14" dur="6.3">individuals the

dur="7.809">at this point is testing</text><text start="3826.92" dur="5.28">that can detect cases as early as</text><text start="3829.859" dur="4.5">possible after exposure with very high</text><text
