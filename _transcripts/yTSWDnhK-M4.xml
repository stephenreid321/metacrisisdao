dur="6.031">that is always the right answer it it&apos;s</text><text start="18.27" dur="4.71">it&apos;s something you actually have to</text><text start="20.13" dur="5.22">think about and feel into each situation</text><text start="22.98" dur="4.97">the instantiation of that situation and</text><text start="25.35" dur="4.6">you wrestle with it</text><text start="27.95" dur="3.77">[Music]</text><text start="29.95" dur="3.87">there are plenty of times where someone</text><text start="31.72" dur="3.78">does the tough love thing to a friend or</text><text start="33.82" dur="3.06">a family member that has addiction going</text><text start="35.5" dur="3.54">on and that&apos;s what it took for the</text><text start="36.88" dur="3.33">person to finally turn around plenty of</text><text start="39.04" dur="2.61">other times where someone does the tough</text><text start="40.21" dur="4.44">love thing and the person who just goes</text><text start="41.65"

start="48.82" dur="5.01">whatever could have turned around and so</text><text start="51.07" dur="5.04">what the right answer is is not like if</text><text start="53.83" dur="5.04">you have a very fast default it&apos;s</text><text start="56.11" dur="4.89">probably wrong it&apos;s something that you</text><text start="58.87" dur="4.08">have to really take the time to reflect</text><text start="61.0" dur="3.66">in to what is actually called for here</text><text start="62.95" dur="3.66">and then reflect into what are my biases</text><text start="64.66" dur="4.08">am i biasing and they I don&apos;t want to</text><text start="66.61" dur="3.96">take their burden on or biasing and the</text><text start="68.74" dur="5.129">codependent I must take it on direction</text><text start="70.57" dur="6.0">that&apos;s going to make me less clear it</text><text start="73.869" dur="4.741">makes me think about the is an old</text><text start="76.57" dur="5.88">distinction that you brought up and also</text><text start="78.61" dur="7.35">about what self development is at it&apos;s</text><text start="82.45" dur="5.669">very core which is trying to model an</text><text start="85.96" dur="6.03">effective way to operate within the</text><text start="88.119" dur="6.81">world it&apos;s trying to make as scientific</text><text start="91.99" dur="5.519">as possible the way that you behave the</text><text start="94.929" dur="3.72">way that I behave sometimes the way that</text><text start="97.509" dur="3.541">we behave there&apos;s books about</text><text start="98.649" dur="5.821">relationships and friendship and and and</text><text start="101.05" dur="5.04">stuff like that but mostly it tends to</text><text start="104.47" dur="5.28">be personal sovereignty upward mobility</text><text start="106.09" dur="5.36">agency stuff like that but as you&apos;ve</text><text start="109.75" dur="6.03">just identified there in that situation</text><text start="111.45" dur="9.1">like there is no one-size-fits-all there</text><text start="115.78" dur="7.11">is no objective way to decide what the</text><text start="120.55" dur="5.819">life that you should lead is what your</text><text start="122.89" dur="6.3">definition of a good life is it&apos;s got a</text><text start="126.369" dur="6.901">shaky foundation evolutionarily it&apos;s got</text><text start="129.19" dur="7.68">a very biased foundation culturally and</text><text start="133.27" dur="5.34">socially you know that is what we&apos;re</text><text start="136.87" dur="3.24">trying to achieve what is the best way</text><text start="138.61" dur="4.98">for me to operate within this world but</text><text start="140.11" dur="6.0">there is no there is no Universal answer</text><text start="143.59" dur="5.009">to that this better end is worse but</text><text start="146.11" dur="6.36">better by who worse by who you know you</text><text start="148.599" dur="11.0">can you can run this back as far as you</text><text start="152.47" dur="7.129">want yeah so I would say that</text><text start="160.94" dur="7.3">wisdom is not algorithmic and cannot be</text><text start="164.37" dur="5.88">made algorithmic you can&apos;t have a if</text><text start="168.24" dur="10.22">this then that algorithm that actually</text><text start="170.25" dur="11.01">equals wisdom and and if you can then</text><text start="178.46" dur="4.66">we&apos;re just a intermediate bootloader for</text><text start="181.26" dur="7.41">the AIS that are better creatures than</text><text start="183.12" dur="8.39">us right I could actually go through</text><text start="188.67" dur="5.25">some long derivations as to why I think</text><text start="191.51" dur="3.85">consciousness is not computational not</text><text start="193.92" dur="2.85">purely computational but there&apos;s</text><text start="195.36" dur="3.03">something happening in consciousness</text><text start="196.77" dur="4.23">that is fundamentally trans</text><text start="198.39" dur="5.22">computational so strong computationalism</text><text start="201.0" dur="4.89">is the idea that computation is both</text><text start="203.61" dur="3.99">necessary and sufficient for</text><text start="205.89" dur="4.46">consciousness mind and universe and I</text><text start="207.6" dur="2.75">believe that&apos;s false</text><text start="213.7" dur="7.259">so there is something to the nature of</text><text start="217.459" dur="7.471">choice and this also good choice ethics</text><text start="220.959" dur="5.86">that can be informed by lots of</text><text start="224.93" dur="5.49">different principles and considerations</text><text start="226.819" dur="10.321">but not perfectly prescribed</text><text start="230.42" dur="8.64">and this is why at lower stages of</text><text start="237.14" dur="6.569">development when people can&apos;t hold as</text><text start="239.06" dur="6.48">much complexity and as much nuance with</text><text start="243.709" dur="3.451">as much awareness sometimes they need</text><text start="245.54" dur="4.38">just simple rules to not go off the</text><text start="247.16" dur="5.76">rails so you think of the 10</text><text start="249.92" dur="4.77">commandments as rules like that right if</text><text start="252.92" dur="3.569">you need to know don&apos;t kill anybody and</text><text start="254.69" dur="3.06">don&apos;t rape anybody and don&apos;t adulterer</text><text start="256.489" dur="3.09">and whatever like okay will tell you</text><text start="257.75" dur="3.48">those things don&apos;t do that like the</text><text start="259.579" dur="5.4">society will be better if people don&apos;t</text><text start="261.23" dur="6.45">do those things but then you notice New</text><text start="264.979" dur="6.361">Testament comes along and Jesus gives a</text><text start="267.68" dur="5.76">different kind of teaching right do unto</text><text start="271.34" dur="4.799">others as you would have them do unto</text><text start="273.44" dur="6.08">you love thy neighbor as thyself</text><text start="276.139" dur="3.381">it actually doesn&apos;t tell you what to do</text><text start="279.79" dur="3.87">it isn&apos;t a do something or don&apos;t do</text><text start="281.77" dur="5.79">something it&apos;s actually consider</text><text start="283.66" dur="5.37">something a certain way so try to put</text><text start="287.56" dur="3.15">yourself into the shoes of whoever</text><text start="289.03" dur="3.93">you&apos;re about to act and ask how you</text><text start="290.71" dur="5.7">would feel engage in empathy</text><text start="292.96" dur="6.24">so it&apos;s an ethic that guides the</text><text start="296.41" dur="4.17">guidance is consider something but not</text><text start="299.2" dur="2.7">do this or don&apos;t do that so it&apos;s</text><text start="300.58" dur="2.73">ultimately not prescriptive</text><text start="301.9" dur="5.4">but there&apos;s still wisdom that can be</text><text start="303.31" dur="5.58">offered so there&apos;s a lot of kind of</text><text start="307.3" dur="4.44">general principles that we can offer</text><text start="308.89" dur="7.23">that support wisdom but it&apos;s not</text><text start="311.74" dur="5.43">reducible to prescription now this is</text><text start="316.12" dur="2.73">also something about personal</text><text start="317.17" dur="3.51">development if one is wanting to grow in</text><text start="318.85" dur="4.07">wisdom as it doesn&apos;t look like do this</text><text start="320.68" dur="2.24">thing</text><text start="325.099" dur="7.231">and so you also can&apos;t signal it very</text><text start="328.8" dur="6.599">effectively by doing a particular thing</text><text start="332.33" dur="3.069">[Music]</text><text start="336.789" dur="4.71">I mean someone could even try to signal</text><text start="339.3" dur="4.929">aligned with what I just said right they</text><text start="341.499" dur="8.67">could say let me consider that as just</text><text start="344.229" dur="8.881">some kind of signaling but that what I&apos;m</text><text start="350.169" dur="6.391">talking about like is a depth of</text><text start="353.11" dur="6.179">earnestness of what do I actually care</text><text start="356.56" dur="4.409">about and why do I care about it and how</text><text start="359.289" dur="3.81">do I reflect on what I believe to be</text><text start="360.969" dur="4.711">both true and meaningful right now and</text><text start="363.099" dur="3.991">what is right action factoring what I</text><text start="365.68" dur="3.63">understand to be true and what I</text><text start="367.09" dur="4.289">understand to be
