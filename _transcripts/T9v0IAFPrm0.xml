i</text><text start="4.24" dur="2.96">keep relating with them</text><text start="7.44" dur="5.52">there there&apos;s so much nuance here</text><text start="10.16" dur="5.04">and then again it&apos;s very easy for people</text><text start="12.96" dur="4.48">to weaponize the idea of nuance</text><text start="15.2" dur="4.239">generally um</text><text start="17.44" dur="3.839">the answer is</text><text start="19.439" dur="4.321">that it&apos;s very easy to have a partial</text><text start="21.279" dur="3.281">truth that polarizes that isn&apos;t held</text><text start="23.76" dur="2.64">with</text><text start="24.56" dur="4.4">other partial truths that polarize or</text><text start="26.4" dur="3.84">like a fact right like the facts we gave</text><text start="28.96" dur="3.759">as examples earlier where i&apos;m</text><text start="30.24" dur="5.12">cherry-picking out of data sets</text><text start="32.719" dur="4.561">that is true but not representative</text><text start="35.36" dur="4.48">um and so then usually the answer is</text><text start="37.28" dur="5.36">include more stuff which is more nuanced</text><text start="39.84" dur="4.719">more complex but then i have seen people</text><text start="42.64" dur="4.239">weaponize the idea</text><text start="44.559" dur="4.401">of nuance when someone is actually</text><text start="46.879" dur="3.52">stating something that is simple and</text><text start="48.96" dur="2.88">actually has truth and clarity and</text><text start="50.399" dur="3.521">simplicity and the other person doesn&apos;t</text><text start="51.84" dur="4.32">want that boundary to exist</text><text start="53.92" dur="3.119">then they say you&apos;re not being nuanced</text><text start="56.16" dur="3.68">enough</text><text start="57.039" dur="2.801">right and so</text><text start="59.92" dur="5.36">this is why it&apos;s like the doubt that his</text><text start="61.28" dur="6.4">name was not the eternal dao the virtue</text><text start="65.28" dur="4.64">that you say is the one that trumps all</text><text start="67.68" dur="4.64">of the other ones</text><text start="69.92" dur="5.12">the the protocol that is the protocol it</text><text start="72.32" dur="2.72">doesn&apos;t exist</text><text start="75.92" dur="4.96">and you know if i want to try and talk</text><text start="78.799" dur="4.241">about integrity</text><text start="80.88" dur="6.16">i usually don&apos;t think of integrity</text><text start="83.04" dur="6.24">as a virtue or a value as much as i</text><text start="87.04" dur="4.48">think that it about it as the degree of</text><text start="89.28" dur="5.6">congruence between my behavior and all</text><text start="91.52" dur="3.36">of my other virtues or values</text><text start="95.439" dur="5.841">and so if i value kindness and i also</text><text start="98.0" dur="5.36">value transparency</text><text start="101.28" dur="4.799">and i value</text><text start="103.36" dur="4.16">truth and i also value connection and i</text><text start="106.079" dur="4.881">then</text><text start="107.52" dur="5.04">how well am i able to navigate high</text><text start="110.96" dur="4.08">correlation between the way i&apos;m showing</text><text start="112.56" dur="4.8">up in all of those values simultaneously</text><text start="115.04" dur="4.8">is kind of my integrity</text><text start="117.36" dur="2.48">assessment</text><text start="120.32" dur="3.439">we were talking about weaponizing</text><text start="122.399" dur="3.76">certain psychological things and there&apos;s</text><text start="123.759" dur="4.0">some more examples that are important</text><text start="126.159" dur="2.8">so we talked about weaponizing</text><text start="127.759" dur="3.441">transparency then we talked about</text><text start="128.959" dur="3.601">weaponizing kindness</text><text start="131.2" dur="3.6">i have seen</text><text start="132.56" dur="3.92">so people can weaponize their own</text><text start="134.8" dur="3.12">vulnerability</text><text start="136.48" dur="3.52">where it&apos;s like</text><text start="137.92" dur="4.959">i watched after brene brown came out and</text><text start="140.0" dur="5.52">did her stuff on vulnerability that then</text><text start="142.879" dur="4.961">i saw all these things on facebook of</text><text start="145.52" dur="3.439">life coaches crying in the camera with</text><text start="147.84" dur="3.28">tears in their eyes showing how</text><text start="148.959" dur="3.121">vulnerable they are and you know then if</text><text start="151.12" dur="2.399">you</text><text start="152.08" dur="3.519">want to learn how to be vulnerable to</text><text start="153.519" dur="4.481">their package is for sale and i&apos;m like</text><text start="155.599" dur="4.561">oh like that that&apos;s like</text><text start="158.0" dur="3.44">weaponizing via virtue signaling</text><text start="160.16" dur="3.28">um</text><text start="161.44" dur="4.0">where the more vulnerable thing if they</text><text start="163.44" dur="3.12">were being really vulnerable wouldn&apos;t be</text><text start="165.44" dur="2.799">them crying about this thing that</text><text start="166.56" dur="3.679">they&apos;ve already resolved and is really</text><text start="168.239" dur="3.841">not actually consequential to them which</text><text start="170.239" dur="4.08">is not real vulnerability it would be</text><text start="172.08" dur="4.239">them saying i&apos;m broke right now guys and</text><text start="174.319" dur="4.081">i need to pay the bills and i really</text><text start="176.319" dur="3.92">want you to buy my package</text><text start="178.4" dur="3.119">and i think that it&apos;s beneficial for</text><text start="180.239" dur="3.36">some people</text><text start="181.519" dur="3.281">and like that would be often actual</text><text start="183.599" dur="2.801">authenticity and vulnerability which</text><text start="184.8" dur="3.68">very rarely happens</text><text start="186.4" dur="4.32">um</text><text start="188.48" dur="5.039">i have seen like one of the worst ones</text><text start="190.72" dur="4.96">is weaponizing apology and</text><text start="193.519" dur="4.481">remorse</text><text start="195.68" dur="5.04">so again associated with something like</text><text start="198.0" dur="2.72">narcissism</text><text start="203.36" dur="3.84">generally</text><text start="205.2" dur="3.84">if the person feels that</text><text start="207.2" dur="3.84">the person who&apos;s challenging them or</text><text start="209.04" dur="5.199">upset with them doesn&apos;t have power and</text><text start="211.04" dur="5.6">they do they will just say</text><text start="214.239" dur="4.0">this is your ego making up nonsense and</text><text start="216.64" dur="3.679">they&apos;ll gaslight them</text><text start="218.239" dur="4.401">but if the other person has power and</text><text start="220.319" dur="3.84">they can&apos;t do that because it&apos;s a whole</text><text start="222.64" dur="2.4">group of people calling them out or it&apos;s</text><text start="224.159" dur="2.0">a very</text><text start="225.04" dur="2.08">someone with a lot of following or</text><text start="226.159" dur="3.121">whatever</text><text start="227.12" dur="3.679">then the most effective game theoretic</text><text start="229.28" dur="3.679">thing for them to do</text><text start="230.799" dur="4.16">might be to start crying</text><text start="232.959" dur="4.241">and say oh my god i&apos;m so sorry this goes</text><text start="234.959" dur="4.081">back to a childhood wound of mine and</text><text start="237.2" dur="3.36">it&apos;s really vulnerable and i&apos;m working</text><text start="239.04" dur="3.279">on it and i thought i had healed this</text><text start="240.56" dur="3.679">pattern and it&apos;s still showing up thank</text><text start="242.319" dur="3.28">you for showing it to me</text><text start="244.239" dur="4.401">i&apos;m really going to work on it i want</text><text start="245.599" dur="5.041">you guys to hold me accountable</text><text start="248.64" dur="3.76">and i have seen people do this with</text><text start="250.64" dur="3.92">tears in their eyes and a week later do</text><text start="252.4" dur="3.28">the exact same thing when powerful</text><text start="254.56" dur="2.72">people weren&apos;t around to hold them</text><text start="255.68" dur="4.559">accountable</text><text start="257.28" dur="5.76">and that is basically weaponizing</text><text start="260.239" dur="4.641">fake remorse and apology and whatever so</text><text start="263.04" dur="3.76">you have to so if i notice that happen</text><text start="264.88" dur="5.2">what i know is that no words that person</text><text start="266.8" dur="5.44">says will mean anything to me</text><text start="270.08" dur="3.92">so i would need to see if that doesn&apos;t</text><text start="272.24" dur="3.04">mean that i&apos;ve closed off redemptive</text><text start="274.0" dur="3.52">possibilities it means i need a</text><text start="275.28" dur="3.68">different kind of signal</text><text start="277.52" dur="3.44">so if the person said no i&apos;ve really</text><text start="278.96" dur="4.0">made a change i&apos;d be like awesome i&apos;m</text><text start="280.96" dur="5.44">gonna watch that that bad behavior</text><text start="282.96" dur="3.44">doesn&apos;t happen for three or five years</text><text start="286.56" dur="3.919">and in</text><text start="288.32" dur="4.08">including where you have to actually</text><text start="290.479" dur="2.801">face consequential things</text><text start="292.4" dur="3.6">right</text><text start="293.28" dur="3.919">and so again the guy beats his wife when</text><text start="296.0" dur="2.88">he&apos;s drunk and then the next day</text><text start="297.199" dur="3.201">apologize i love you i&apos;m sorry i&apos;m never</text><text start="298.88" dur="3.52">going to drink again and whatever right</text><text start="300.4" dur="4.16">and the pattern keeps rinse repeat it&apos;s</text><text start="302.4" dur="4.0">not an apology at the level that will</text><text start="304.56" dur="3.199">actually change the pattern therefore it</text><text start="306.4" dur="3.6">is a weapon to keep her bound to an</text><text start="307.759" dur="5.121">abuse cycle</text><text start="310.0" dur="4.56">so when is an apology or remorse or</text><text start="312.88" dur="2.64">accountability</text><text start="314.56" dur="3.68">real</text><text start="315.52" dur="5.2">well it&apos;s when it is at the level of</text><text start="318.24" dur="3.6">depth that will actually change the</text><text start="320.72" dur="2.96">behavior</text><text start="321.84" dur="3.359">if it isn&apos;t</text><text start="323.68" dur="4.799">then whether the person thinks they mean</text><text start="325.199" dur="4.56">it in the moment or not you shouldn&apos;t</text><text start="328.479" dur="3.521">trust it right</text><text start="329.759" dur="2.241">so</text><text start="332.08" dur="3.76">i i can obviously give a million</text><text start="333.84" dur="3.6">examples what i&apos;m hoping is i&apos;ve given</text><text start="335.84" dur="3.84">enough examples that you can start</text><text start="337.44" dur="4.64">finding your own examples</text><text start="339.68" dur="4.72">now does this mean that anytime someone</text><text start="342.08" dur="3.92">is crying and apologizing that they</text><text start="344.4" dur="3.28">are weaponizing it not earnest no</text><text start="346.0" dur="3.36">sometimes they might really be earnest</text><text start="347.68" dur="3.359">and they&apos;re going to shift forever</text><text start="349.36" dur="3.52">or they&apos;re going to start a process that</text><text start="351.039" dur="3.44">will work with a difficult pro you know</text><text start="352.88" dur="3.12">difficult set of</text><text start="354.479" dur="3.44">dynamics that might involve a little bit</text><text start="356.0" dur="3.6">of relapse but earnestly is oriented in</text><text start="357.919" dur="2.56">a different direction versus they&apos;re</text><text start="359.6" dur="2.8">just</text><text start="360.479" dur="3.521">doing the mia culpa they need to to get</text><text start="362.4" dur="3.12">out of accountability in the moment and</text><text start="364.0" dur="3.68">then go back to power seeking as soon as</text><text start="365.52" dur="4.0">everyone&apos;s attention is off of them</text><text start="367.68" dur="3.6">which is why three months isn&apos;t enough</text><text start="369.52" dur="4.0">right and now can some people play a</text><text start="371.28" dur="3.84">long game sure we have seen some great</text><text start="373.52" dur="2.72">political strategists who play a long</text><text start="375.12" dur="3.28">game</text><text start="376.24" dur="3.84">so even the principle of wait a few</text><text start="378.4" dur="4.239">years is not a perfect principle it&apos;s a</text><text start="380.08" dur="2.559">rule of thumb</text><text start="383.68" dur="5.28">another way of thinking about what we&apos;re</text><text start="385.68" dur="3.28">discussing here is</text><text start="391.36" dur="3.839">that when people are communicating with</text><text start="393.44" dur="5.84">other people</text><text start="395.199" dur="4.081">in person or via some kind of media</text><text start="399.84" dur="2.96">what is the basis of why they&apos;re</text><text start="401.44" dur="4.24">communicating</text><text start="402.8" dur="4.8">what is the actual motive or agenda or</text><text start="405.68" dur="4.0">ordinating basis of that communication</text><text start="407.6" dur="4.08">because it&apos;s a it is a shared thing</text><text start="409.68" dur="3.76">there&apos;s an interpersonal thing happening</text><text start="411.68" dur="4.079">is the communication for the</text><text start="413.44" dur="4.08">interpersonal benefit for the benefit of</text><text start="415.759" dur="2.801">those people and the whole the larger</text><text start="417.52" dur="3.36">holes that they&apos;re part of in the</text><text start="418.56" dur="4.56">ecology whatever is it for some private</text><text start="420.88" dur="5.68">benefit is the motive being shared is it</text><text start="423.12" dur="3.44">not being shared these are</text><text start="426.96" dur="3.519">important inquiries and humans are smart</text><text start="429.36" dur="3.279">and</text><text start="430.479" dur="3.761">we have a world where</text><text start="432.639" dur="3.441">there are ways where we can advantage</text><text start="434.24" dur="3.28">ourselves at the expense of others there</text><text start="436.08" dur="4.399">are ways where</text><text start="437.52" dur="4.64">the expense to other can be hidden so we</text><text start="440.479" dur="3.44">have plausible deniability on it or</text><text start="442.16" dur="3.759">seems diffused to a lot of people so it</text><text start="443.919" dur="3.601">doesn&apos;t seem that bad or seems</text><text start="445.919" dur="3.361">rationalizable because if i don&apos;t some</text><text start="447.52" dur="3.519">other bad thing will happen</text><text start="449.28" dur="3.84">so there&apos;s a lot of reasons why someone</text><text start="451.039" dur="4.0">can even feel moral and right by doing</text><text start="453.12" dur="4.24">something to be self-serving that</text><text start="455.039" dur="4.961">involves sharing something that is to</text><text start="457.36" dur="4.239">some degree distorted meaning not true</text><text start="460.0" dur="3.919">or not the whole truth in a</text><text start="461.599" dur="4.32">representative way or whatever i don&apos;t</text><text start="463.919" dur="3.761">think the history on this is clear i</text><text start="465.919" dur="3.761">think there&apos;s still a good bit of debate</text><text start="467.68" dur="3.04">on theories of it</text><text start="469.68" dur="3.6">um</text><text start="470.72" dur="4.159">gelman and gerard and you know various</text><text start="473.28" dur="3.199">thinkers on the history of linguistics</text><text start="474.879" dur="5.04">have different thoughts on the evolution</text><text start="476.479" dur="7.44">of spoken language and you know then</text><text start="479.919" dur="5.68">uh formalizations of spoken language</text><text start="483.919" dur="3.84">but i think it&apos;s pretty clear that</text><text start="485.599" dur="3.921">language did not evolve just based on</text><text start="487.759" dur="4.961">individual selection</text><text start="489.52" dur="4.64">it was that groups survived better</text><text start="492.72" dur="3.599">based on their ability to share</text><text start="494.16" dur="4.24">information and coordinate better i.e to</text><text start="496.319" dur="3.361">share sense making i went and i saw</text><text start="498.4" dur="2.799">where the predator was or where the</text><text start="499.68" dur="3.519">berries were where the water was and i</text><text start="501.199" dur="3.521">come back and share so the ability for</text><text start="503.199" dur="2.881">the people to share their sense making</text><text start="504.72" dur="3.039">and then to be able to coordinate that</text><text start="506.08" dur="3.6">has a group intelligence that is better</text><text start="507.759" dur="3.521">than just the individual intelligences</text><text start="509.68" dur="3.359">that their ability to communicate</text><text start="511.28" dur="3.04">created groups that survive better so</text><text start="513.039" dur="2.721">then those individuals that did</text><text start="514.32" dur="3.36">effective communication within groups</text><text start="515.76" dur="3.12">did so it&apos;s a group selection phenomena</text><text start="517.68" dur="3.919">more than an individual selection</text><text start="518.88" dur="4.24">phenomena which means that the evolution</text><text start="521.599" dur="3.601">of language was actually for the</text><text start="523.12" dur="3.92">survival of the group this is something</text><text start="525.2" dur="3.199">that forrest has landry&apos;s done a
