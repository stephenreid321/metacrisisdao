dur="6.001">like nick bostrom and max tegmark and</text><text start="10.4" dur="3.44">whatever of uh</text><text start="14.96" dur="3.44">because of the collective action problem</text><text start="16.88" dur="3.84">and the multi-polar trap race to the</text><text start="18.4" dur="2.32">bottom</text><text start="21.359" dur="3.84">and yet because of the complexity of the</text><text start="23.92" dur="3.679">issues that we face</text><text start="25.199" dur="3.201">that are beyond what the smartest person</text><text start="27.599" dur="4.321">could</text><text start="28.4" dur="6.159">manage by a lot is the only answer</text><text start="31.92" dur="4.0">to build a benevolent ai overlord that</text><text start="34.559" dur="2.961">uh can run a one-world</text><text start="35.92" dur="3.76">government because it can process the</text><text start="37.52" dur="4.719">information to make good choices</text><text start="39.68" dur="3.68">so as you can guess my answer is</text><text start="42.239" dur="4.16">vigorously no</text><text start="43.36" dur="4.8">yep not just because i think the</text><text start="46.399" dur="3.201">optimization function that it would run</text><text start="48.16" dur="3.52">no matter how many variables would end</text><text start="49.6" dur="5.119">up becoming a paperclip maximizer</text><text start="51.68" dur="5.28">but uh i think its own</text><text start="54.719" dur="3.52">existential risks are bound up in that</text><text start="56.96" dur="4.399">process</text><text start="58.239" dur="3.441">these guys know know this but it&apos;s easy</text><text start="61.359" dur="2.161">to</text><text start="61.68" dur="3.04">pick solutions like that compared to the</text><text start="63.52" dur="4.88">other ones that seem</text><text start="64.72" dur="7.439">maybe even more likely to go terrible</text><text start="68.4" dur="7.6">so then we say okay we don&apos;t want</text><text start="72.159" dur="6.0">a one world government run by</text><text start="76.0" dur="4.08">any of the people we currently have and</text><text start="78.159" dur="3.521">we also don&apos;t want separate nations</text><text start="80.08" dur="3.84">where any of them that defect lead</text><text start="81.68" dur="3.6">everybody into a race to the bottom</text><text start="83.92" dur="3.199">so that means that they have to have</text><text start="85.28" dur="3.68">rule of law over each other because they</text><text start="87.119" dur="3.521">affect common spaces</text><text start="88.96" dur="2.799">so how do you have rule of law over each</text><text start="90.64" dur="3.519">other without it being one world</text><text start="91.759" dur="4.32">government and then capture</text><text start="94.159" dur="3.841">oppression or chaos at various scales</text><text start="96.079" dur="3.121">and the only answer is the comprehensive</text><text start="98.0" dur="2.159">education and enlightenment of the</text><text start="99.2" dur="4.239">people that can</text><text start="100.159" dur="4.801">check those systems now obviously the</text><text start="103.439" dur="4.0">founding of this country was fraught</text><text start="104.96" dur="5.119">with all the problems that we know of</text><text start="107.439" dur="4.161">now in particular and it was still a</text><text start="110.079" dur="4.4">step forward</text><text start="111.6" dur="4.72">in terms of a movement towards the</text><text start="114.479" dur="3.761">possibility of some freedoms from the</text><text start="116.32" dur="5.759">feudalism it came from</text><text start="118.24" dur="5.44">and so uh i i find the study of the</text><text start="122.079" dur="2.481">foundation of it the theoretical</text><text start="123.68" dur="3.039">foundation of it</text><text start="124.56" dur="3.759">meaningful to what we&apos;re doing right now</text><text start="126.719" dur="3.121">and famously there&apos;s this quote from</text><text start="128.319" dur="2.801">george washington where he says</text><text start="129.84" dur="3.6">something to the effect i&apos;m going to</text><text start="131.12" dur="4.56">paraphrase it the comprehensive</text><text start="133.44" dur="3.84">education of every single citizen in the</text><text start="135.68" dur="3.76">science of government</text><text start="137.28" dur="5.76">should be the main aim of the federal</text><text start="139.44" dur="5.68">government and i think it is fascinating</text><text start="143.04" dur="4.88">so science of government was his term of</text><text start="145.12" dur="4.32">art and science of government meant</text><text start="147.92" dur="3.039">everything that you would need to have a</text><text start="149.44" dur="2.32">government of formed by the people which</text><text start="150.959" dur="4.401">is the</text><text start="151.76" dur="5.199">history the social philosophy the the</text><text start="155.36" dur="3.44">game theory in political science and</text><text start="156.959" dur="3.121">economics as well as the science to</text><text start="158.8" dur="2.88">understand the infrastructural tech</text><text start="160.08" dur="3.2">stack and whatever right</text><text start="161.68" dur="3.36">um the hegelian dialectic the</text><text start="163.28" dur="4.4">enlightenment ideas of the time</text><text start="165.04" dur="3.76">but the number one goal of the federal</text><text start="167.68" dur="4.639">government is not</text><text start="168.8" dur="5.04">rule of law and it&apos;s not</text><text start="172.319" dur="3.28">currency creation and it&apos;s not</text><text start="173.84" dur="3.44">protection of its borders because if</text><text start="175.599" dur="3.761">it&apos;s any of those things it will become</text><text start="177.28" dur="3.679">an impressive tyranny soon</text><text start="179.36" dur="3.68">it has to be the comprehensive education</text><text start="180.959" dur="3.601">of the people if it is to be a</text><text start="183.04" dur="3.119">government of formed by the people now</text><text start="184.56" dur="4.08">this is the interesting thing</text><text start="186.159" dur="4.241">now i remember where i want to go</text><text start="188.64" dur="2.319">comprehensive education of the people is</text><text start="190.4" dur="2.8">a</text><text start="190.959" dur="4.161">force is is something that makes more</text><text start="193.2" dur="4.16">cemetery possible</text><text start="195.12" dur="3.52">symmetry of power possible it&apos;s a</text><text start="197.36" dur="3.12">increasing</text><text start="198.64" dur="3.12">people&apos;s information

vested interest in</text><text start="207.92" dur="4.16">increasing asymmetries</text><text start="209.84" dur="3.759">has an interest in decreasing people&apos;s</text><text start="212.08" dur="3.84">comprehensive education in the science</text><text start="213.599" dur="6.72">of government</text><text start="215.92" dur="6.0">and so now let&apos;s look at the education</text><text start="220.319" dur="6.081">changes that happened following world</text><text start="221.92" dur="7.039">war ii in the u.s</text><text start="226.4" dur="4.8">there is a theory there&apos;s a there&apos;s a</text><text start="228.959" dur="5.681">story that i buy</text><text start="231.2" dur="5.599">that the u.s started</text><text start="234.64" dur="3.44">focusing on stem education science</text><text start="236.799" dur="2.961">technology engineering math</text><text start="238.08" dur="3.2">super heavily partly because it was an</text><text start="239.76" dur="4.08">existential risk because look what</text><text start="241.28" dur="4.4">happened with the stem that the</text><text start="243.84" dur="3.44">germans did and now we know that a lot</text><text start="245.68" dur="3.199">of the german scientists that we didn&apos;t</text><text start="247.28" dur="3.2">get an operation paperclip the russians</text><text start="248.879" dur="3.761">gotten sputnik and so</text><text start="250.48" dur="3.52">it&apos;s an existential risk to not dominate</text><text start="252.64" dur="2.959">the tech space so we need to really</text><text start="254.0" dur="3.199">double down on stem and we need all the</text><text start="255.599" dur="3.121">smartest guys we need to find every von</text><text start="257.199" dur="3.921">neumann and touring</text><text start="258.72" dur="3.44">and find when there is so the smarter</text><text start="261.12" dur="2.96">you are the more we want to push you</text><text start="262.16" dur="4.479">into stem so you can be an effective</text><text start="264.08" dur="3.44">part of the system that&apos;s part of the</text><text start="266.639" dur="3.361">story</text><text start="267.52" dur="3.84">but also the thing that washington said</text><text start="270.0" dur="3.12">the education and the science of</text><text start="271.36" dur="2.72">government we started cutting civics</text><text start="273.12" dur="2.48">radically</text><text start="274.08" dur="3.6">and i think it was because social</text><text start="275.6" dur="3.84">philosophers at the time like marx were</text><text start="277.68" dur="2.88">actually problematic to the dominant</text><text start="279.44" dur="2.72">system</text><text start="280.56" dur="4.16">and i&apos;m not saying that mark&apos;s got the</text><text start="282.16" dur="4.4">right ideas i&apos;m saying the idea of okay</text><text start="284.72" dur="5.12">we have a system</text><text start="286.56" dur="5.52">where let&apos;s have the only people</text><text start="289.84" dur="3.6">who really think about social philosophy</text><text start="292.08"

the elites</text><text start="319.36" dur="6.08">effectively in charge of</text><text start="322.479" dur="3.561">governance they can do exactly what you</text><text start="325.44" dur="1.759">would
