dur="3.84">it&apos;s very inconvenient</text><text start="42.539" dur="6.09">yeah it&apos;s incredibly inconvenient you</text><text start="44.879" dur="6.53">know um so as you where we talk a lot on</text><text start="48.629" dur="6.36">this podcast about self development and</text><text start="51.409" dur="5.83">you help people to make sense of the</text><text start="54.989" dur="6.3">world sense-making preventing global</text><text start="57.239" dur="7.831">catastrophic risks so in light of the</text><text start="61.289" dur="7.051">way that the world is at the moment what</text><text start="65.07" dur="7.14">are your thoughts about how people can</text><text start="68.34" dur="7.47">develop themselves while still ensuring</text><text start="72.21" dur="10.17">that we have a functioning world that</text><text start="75.81" dur="9.33">isn&apos;t isn&apos;t risky we can go like a</text><text start="82.38" dur="5.43">million places with that question and so</text><text start="85.14" dur="7.59">we&apos;ll just start and see what see what</text><text start="87.81" dur="8.49">happens even the topic of personal</text><text start="92.73" dur="6.69">development what that means is pretty</text><text start="96.3" dur="5.07">ambiguous the idea of development means</text><text start="99.42" dur="3.9">that something can progress to some</text><text start="101.37" dur="5.58">stage of more refinement or more</text><text start="103.32" dur="6.45">capacity and so we know what that means</text><text start="106.95" dur="4.26">in mathematics or in playing classical</text><text start="109.77" dur="4.08">piano or weightlifting right there&apos;s</text><text start="111.21" dur="4.08">some sense of progressive development</text><text start="113.85" dur="4.5">but what does it mean for a person to</text><text start="115.29" dur="4.71">develop beyond early adulthood we also</text><text start="118.35" dur="3.95">have a very clear sense that children go</text><text start="120.0" dur="5.1">through developmental stages of</text><text start="122.3" dur="4.87">increasing their cognitive and social</text><text start="125.1" dur="4.32">and linguistic and motor and all these</text><text start="127.17" dur="3.479">types of capacities but then when does</text><text start="129.42" dur="3.12">that stop</text><text start="130.649" dur="4.191">does it have to stop there&apos;s a</text><text start="132.54" dur="4.589">development of more skills but what does</text><text start="134.84" dur="5.59">becoming a more developed human being</text><text start="137.129" dur="5.491">fundamentally mean is a philosophic is</text><text start="140.43" dur="6.0">spiritual religious existential question</text><text start="142.62" dur="6.77">and to the question of what is a</text><text start="146.43" dur="7.979">meaningful human life is underneath that</text><text start="149.39" dur="8.89">and then how do I effectively develop</text><text start="154.409" dur="10.231">myself align with what is most</text><text start="158.28" dur="10.23">meaningful and when I&apos;m asking what is a</text><text start="164.64" dur="5.61">meaningful human life there&apos;s not just</text><text start="168.51" dur="3.24">my own experience but how do I relate to</text><text start="170.25" dur="4.5">the whole of life how does the</text><text start="171.75" dur="4.59">meaningfulness of life relate to both</text><text start="174.75" dur="3.09">what I experience and also what I</text><text start="176.34" dur="6.149">contribute to the experience of others</text><text start="177.84" dur="6.989">and so when we think about the current</text><text start="182.489" dur="4.5">world situation does the world situation</text><text start="184.829" dur="3.78">were in create a context for what kinds</text><text start="186.989" dur="4.981">of human development are relevant within</text><text start="188.609" dur="7.831">the general parameters of some universal</text><text start="191.97" dur="6.44">truths and it certainly does because</text><text start="196.44" dur="4.53">what the world needs if we want to</text><text start="198.41" dur="4.84">really effectively serve to protect</text><text start="200.97" dur="4.169">against unnecessary harm and to increase</text><text start="203.25" dur="3.54">the quality of life it needs different</text><text start="205.139" dur="5.94">skills than it needed a thousand years</text><text start="206.79" dur="7.14">ago and it needs different it actually</text><text start="211.079" dur="6.481">needs totally different kinds of minds</text><text start="213.93" dur="5.13">and sense-making in many ways and then</text><text start="217.56" dur="3.209">some aspects of it are obviously going</text><text start="219.06" dur="3.66">to be the same across lots of contexts</text><text start="220.769" dur="6.56">like the refinement of our clarity and</text><text start="222.72" dur="8.879">our own motivation and our own emotional</text><text start="227.329" dur="5.891">resilience and things like that I think</text><text start="231.599" dur="4.441">the motivation is an interesting one to</text><text start="233.22" dur="5.159">start on which is as soon as you have a</text><text start="236.04" dur="5.039">concept of human development and there&apos;s</text><text start="238.379" dur="4.86">some concept of more developed and you</text><text start="241.079" dur="4.691">can conceptually understand that to try</text><text start="243.239" dur="6.811">and orient yourself</text><text start="245.77" dur="6.39">then there becomes an inherent</text><text start="250.05" dur="4.39">comparison with other people of are</text><text start="252.16" dur="6.51">they&apos;ve comprehensively more developed</text><text start="254.44" dur="6.03">human than I am and or am i more than</text><text start="258.67" dur="3.36">they are and is my thinking that I&apos;m</text><text start="260.47" dur="2.61">more than they are some sign of ego</text><text start="262.03" dur="5.88">which is actually a sign of low</text><text start="263.08" dur="8.76">development in some particular way and</text><text start="267.91" dur="5.91">it&apos;s easy to cognitively understand what</text><text start="271.84" dur="5.43">some higher stage of development would</text><text start="273.82" dur="8.04">Express like and be able to act it</text><text start="277.27" dur="7.08">without it actually being real and so as</text><text start="281.86" dur="4.89">soon as there&apos;s you know you read David</text><text start="284.35" dur="5.01">it--and you have the an authentic man is</text><text start="286.75" dur="4.2">such and such or embodied woman is such</text><text start="289.36" dur="3.54">and such or whatever well you can just</text><text start="290.95" dur="5.39">start acting that and having it be</text><text start="292.9" dur="3.44">totally not real and having</text><text start="297.12" dur="7.019">a bunch of personal development</text><text start="299.21" dur="8.2">mimicking for basically status seeking</text><text start="304.139" dur="5.721">and what&apos;s underneath that the status</text><text start="307.41" dur="5.34">seeking impulse which is usually</text><text start="309.86" dur="4.33">fundamental insecurities is actually not</text><text start="312.75" dur="3.09">healing itself which would the real</text><text start="314.19" dur="3.479">personal development would be it&apos;s</text><text start="315.84" dur="3.75">actually doubling down on itself in</text><text start="317.669" dur="3.871">building up a presentation package and</text><text start="319.59" dur="3.48">whether it&apos;s I&apos;m rich or I&apos;m buff or M</text><text start="321.54" dur="5.64">enlightened just depends on the</text><text start="323.07" dur="7.19">subculture you&apos;re appealing to that is a</text><text start="327.18" dur="7.109">very hard red pill to swallow and I</text><text start="330.26" dur="7.09">couldn&apos;t agree more the there&apos;s a quote</text><text start="334.289" dur="4.651">from member John who says that character</text><text start="337.35" dur="4.47">will always beat strategy</text><text start="338.94" dur="4.68">he&apos;s a CrossFit coach and I think what</text><text start="341.82" dur="4.08">he&apos;s talking about there is the virtue</text><text start="343.62" dur="5.34">of doing the thing because it&apos;s the</text><text start="345.9" dur="5.16">thing that you want to do from your</text><text start="348.96" dur="5.16">innermost being as opposed to doing the</text><text start="351.06" dur="5.4">thing because that&apos;s what you think you</text><text start="354.12" dur="4.14">should do based on what you&apos;ve been told</text><text start="356.46" dur="5.04">so that you can then signal that you are</text><text start="358.26" dur="8.779">a person who has these virtues it&apos;s tart</text><text start="361.5" dur="9.539">horse or horse cart when you mention</text><text start="367.039" dur="5.201">virtue signaling which will obviously</text><text start="371.039" dur="3.121">show very differently in different</text><text start="372.24" dur="4.02">cultures right I&apos;m a good Republican</text><text start="374.16" dur="4.08">versus I&apos;m a good Democrat is going to</text><text start="376.26" dur="5.219">have totally it&apos;ll be repulsive to the</text><text start="378.24" dur="5.22">people of the different tribe or</text><text start="381.479" dur="6.301">religions or different types of</text><text start="383.46" dur="5.7">aesthetics from an evolutionary biology</text><text start="387.78" dur="3.8">perspective it&apos;s mostly just mate</text><text start="389.16" dur="6.17">signaling</text><text start="391.58" dur="7.519">and so whether it&apos;s a 150 foot super</text><text start="395.33" dur="3.769">yacht or it&apos;s</text><text start="399.919" dur="4.02">you know having read all the books in a</text><text start="402.199" dur="5.041">particular space and presenting yourself</text><text start="403.939" dur="5.401">in a way that we say okay well where is</text><text start="407.24" dur="4.32">that imperative to want people to</text><text start="409.34" dur="4.049">respond to me in a particular way well</text><text start="411.56" dur="3.359">it has something to do with power</text><text start="413.389" dur="4.471">dynamics in a tribe and largely</text><text start="414.919" dur="5.701">basically mate signaling is the</text><text start="417.86" dur="5.73">evolutionary origin of it it&apos;s valuable</text><text start="420.62" dur="6.06">to just admit that and just kind of</text><text start="423.59" dur="4.34">reflect on it to say the more I can</text><text start="426.68" dur="3.209">reflect on the biological</text><text start="427.93" dur="5.049">predispositions that arise the less I&apos;m</text><text start="429.889" dur="4.68">controlled by them and I don&apos;t want to</text><text start="432.979" dur="3.601">be ashamed of a repressed they more just</text><text start="434.569" dur="4.32">automatically go with them right because</text><text start="436.58" dur="4.26">they gave rise to the capacity for</text><text start="438.889" dur="5.4">abstraction and the abstraction can give</text><text start="440.84" dur="8.4">rise to higher order interests than the</text><text start="444.289" dur="6.6">base interests so this is actually a</text><text start="449.24" dur="8.459">very valuable thing in personal</text><text start="450.889" dur="9.03">development is just taking the time to</text><text start="457.699" dur="3.851">very deeply earnestly inquire into your</text><text start="459.919" dur="4.93">motive</text><text start="461.55" dur="7.92">and okay I&apos;m wanting to develop in this</text><text start="464.849" dur="7.711">way why is because mostly the Y&apos;s are</text><text start="469.47" dur="7.47">actually lies right it&apos;s I believe that</text><text start="472.56" dur="6.0">when I&apos;m buff then I will dot dot dot</text><text start="476.94" dur="3.84">and it&apos;s and it&apos;s not gonna be true</text><text start="478.56" dur="8.449">right so the thing happens and then it&apos;s</text><text start="480.78" dur="9.69">just some other set of goals and and so</text><text start="487.009" dur="6.431">typically whenever someone is going</text><text start="490.47" dur="5.36">about doing some project to help the</text><text start="493.44" dur="5.25">world or develop themselves or whatever</text><text start="495.83" dur="4.329">they usually have mixed motives they</text><text start="498.69" dur="4.02">have like a dozen different motives</text><text start="500.159" dur="4.891">driving them and they&apos;re usually only</text><text start="502.71" dur="3.959">aware of half of them and they&apos;ll</text><text start="505.05" dur="6.06">usually only admit like one or two of</text><text start="506.669" dur="6.601">them and but this will affect your</text><text start="511.11" dur="4.14">results and your trustworthiness because</text><text start="513.27" dur="7.05">those motives will pull in different</text><text start="515.25" dur="6.779">ways and so let&apos;s say I&apos;m trying to</text><text start="520.32" dur="3.0">develop myself as someone who&apos;s more</text><text start="522.029" dur="3.031">capable of making a difference in the</text><text start="523.32" dur="4.74">world and so I&apos;m doing some alleviating</text><text start="525.06" dur="4.29">poverty project and the read the mission</text><text start="528.06" dur="2.94">statement of why we&apos;re doing this is</text><text start="529.35" dur="2.97">because these kids don&apos;t have shoes and</text><text start="531.0" dur="3.839">they don&apos;t have food and we need to</text><text start="532.32" dur="4.019">bring it to them and we care that might</text><text start="534.839" dur="4.921">actually be true like I might actually</text><text start="536.339" dur="5.131">care as one of the twelve or so motives</text><text start="539.76" dur="3.99">as me doing that I might also need to</text><text start="541.47" dur="4.25">make some money and this nonprofit is a</text><text start="543.75" dur="11.76">way that I can make some money I also</text><text start="545.72" dur="11.83">might want to feel successful in a</text><text start="555.51" dur="4.53">different way and this hits a certain</text><text start="557.55" dur="4.92">idea of what what will make me feel</text><text start="560.04" dur="5.93">successful and then there may be a bunch</text><text start="562.47" dur="6.27">of stuff that&apos;s unconscious like</text><text start="565.97" dur="5.739">insecurity from childhood and school and</text><text start="568.74" dur="4.71">still wanting to hear that I did a good</text><text start="571.709" dur="3.241">job that my parents didn&apos;t give me or</text><text start="573.45" dur="4.71">that they did project it on to the rest</text><text start="574.95" dur="6.21">of the world the degree to which you can</text><text start="578.16" dur="4.65">just really watch that right just watch</text><text start="581.16" dur="2.97">the things that are rising in the mind</text><text start="582.81" dur="3.0">and they&apos;ll show up when you notice</text><text start="584.13" dur="5.88">where who you&apos;re comparing yourself with</text><text start="585.81" dur="5.73">and where you feel jealousies which is</text><text start="590.01" dur="2.639">something that you think that your one</text><text start="591.54" dur="3.36">thing that they&apos;re someone else is</text><text start="592.649" dur="5.731">getting socially or whatever</text><text start="594.9" dur="6.77">and just in in reflecting then you can</text><text start="598.38" dur="3.29">ask yourself the question</text><text start="603.44" dur="5.8">so which of these seem like they&apos;re</text><text start="606.03" dur="6.66">coming from wholeness like from from the</text><text start="609.24" dur="5.01">deepest whole list version of myself I</text><text start="612.69" dur="3.03">could imagine and which of them feel</text><text start="614.25" dur="5.16">like they&apos;re more coming from insecurity</text><text start="615.72" dur="5.82">or woundedness and if I imagine myself</text><text start="619.41" dur="4.61">growing in my wholeness which of these</text><text start="621.54" dur="4.77">would deepen in which would lessen and</text><text start="624.02" dur="4.51">then of the ones that would lessen you</text><text start="626.31" dur="6.24">can just ask if this wasn&apos;t there at all</text><text start="628.53" dur="5.97">how would my life be different like the</text><text start="632.55" dur="3.81">desire that people like me or whatever</text><text start="634.5" dur="3.6">it is this wasn&apos;t there at all and that</text><text start="636.36" dur="3.69">doesn&apos;t mean to pathologize it just you</text><text start="638.1" dur="4.38">just get it inquire in that and notice</text><text start="640.05" dur="4.89">how does it move you and maybe some ways</text><text start="642.48" dur="4.8">that it moves you are fine but it&apos;s good</text><text start="644.94" dur="5.22">to at least be clear on it are those</text><text start="647.28" dur="5.55">some of the signals that people can use</text><text start="650.16" dur="4.77">to identify that because the pernicious</text><text start="652.83" dur="4.02">thing about our subconscious is that</text><text start="654.93" dur="3.56">were not conscious of it not without</text><text start="656.85" dur="5.07">doing a tremendous amount of</text><text start="658.49" dur="5.14">introspective work time in solitude and</text><text start="661.92" dur="7.35">all that sort of stuff</text><text start="663.63" dur="9.33">so are there any signals that people can</text><text start="669.27" dur="5.93">say that&apos;s that&apos;s that thing manifesting</text><text start="672.96" dur="2.24">again</text><text start="676.26" dur="7.72">yeah I mean I think a lot of people if</text><text start="681.58" dur="8.58">they just make time kind of already know</text><text start="683.98" dur="8.25">what some of the signals are say there&apos;s</text><text start="690.16" dur="3.09">a project you want to do and you want to</text><text start="692.23" dur="2.94">do it because it actually feels</text><text start="693.25" dur="7.83">intrinsically meaningful right there&apos;s a</text><text start="695.17" dur="7.74">real intrinsic motive and you think</text><text start="701.08" dur="3.27">about someone else getting credit for it</text><text start="702.91" dur="2.94">you&apos;re not getting credit for it versus</text><text start="704.35" dur="3.39">you getting credit for it you just or</text><text start="705.85" dur="4.62">even notice in the process of a</text><text start="707.74" dur="6.3">conversation where there is a credit</text><text start="710.47" dur="5.82">seeking impulse arise in you and you say</text><text start="714.04" dur="4.02">oh that impulse and the impulse to</text><text start="716.29" dur="3.21">actually serve are not the same impulse</text><text start="718.06" dur="5.219">those are two different impulses that</text><text start="719.5" dur="5.49">are both arising and they maybe they can</text><text start="723.279" dur="2.881">be made to be to sled-dogs pulling in</text><text start="724.99" dur="3.32">the same direction but they might be</text><text start="726.16" dur="4.41">sled dogs pulling in opposite directions</text><text start="728.31" dur="3.91">because sometimes the way I can serve</text><text start="730.57" dur="3.78">the project best is to let someone else</text><text start="732.22" dur="5.97">take credit so they work harder to make</text><text start="734.35" dur="5.64">the thing happen and this is why you</text><text start="738.19" dur="4.92">know if you read the daodejing</text><text start="739.99" dur="5.28">as a book of leadership almost it just</text><text start="743.11" dur="3.599">says that thing again and again the best</text><text start="745.27" dur="3.39">leader is the one that nobody even knows</text><text start="746.709" dur="3.211">is leading who doesn&apos;t want to lead

people&apos;s experience of</text><text start="1026.55" dur="4.11">life and seeing that that&apos;s meaningful</text><text start="1028.17" dur="4.92">in your desire to serve life in that way</text><text start="1030.66" dur="5.91">and it just enter the answer there is</text><text start="1033.09" dur="8.3">not really a deep philosophical inquiry</text><text start="1036.57" dur="4.82">it&apos;s more about a felt experience</text><text start="1043.11" dur="11.129">that&apos;s great and you know the first</text><text start="1050.789" dur="5.041">verse of the Tao Te Ching is that the</text><text start="1054.239" dur="3.03">knowledge that is knowable is not the</text><text start="1055.83" dur="4.64">eternal knowledge and the Dao that is</text><text start="1057.269" dur="3.201">speakable is not the eternal Dao</text><text start="1060.58" dur="6.209">which means the to translate the meaning</text><text start="1064.72" dur="4.429">or the purpose of everything that you</text><text start="1066.789" dur="7.311">can describe in words isn&apos;t really it</text><text start="1069.149" dur="4.951">because it&apos;s fundamentally transom antic</text><text start="1074.76" dur="4.45">semantics is a symbol that has a very</text><text start="1077.679" dur="3.661">finite meaning that is supposed to</text><text start="1079.21" dur="5.059">represent a certain ground right like</text><text start="1081.34" dur="4.559">the word Apple references Apple you know</text><text start="1084.269" dur="4.51">but when I&apos;m talking about</text><text start="1085.899" dur="4.89">meaningfulness of reality there is no</text><text start="1088.779" dur="6.331">word that can actually hold the ground</text><text start="1090.789" dur="6.711">of everything and so there can be though</text><text start="1095.11" dur="5.809">a certain kind of felt sense of</text><text start="1097.5" dur="3.419">connectedness with it</text><text start="1101.48" dur="4.11">now we can also think about it more and</text><text start="1103.669" dur="3.661">come up with better answers and it&apos;s</text><text start="1105.59" dur="3.059">actually nice when we do both of these</text><text start="1107.33" dur="3.27">and there&apos;s a confluence of the</text><text start="1108.649" dur="4.02">deepening of our own felt connection and</text><text start="1110.6" dur="4.76">the deepening of the clarity of how we</text><text start="1112.669" dur="2.691">understand it</text><text start="1120.46" dur="9.339">so some people go to landmark and it</text><text start="1124.7" dur="9.12">starts with well I don&apos;t want to say</text><text start="1129.799" dur="8.311">what landmark says there there are some</text><text start="1133.82" dur="7.38">systems that will say reality is</text><text start="1138.11" dur="4.439">fundamentally meaningless and that&apos;s</text><text start="1141.2" dur="4.31">empowering and beautiful because you get</text><text start="1142.549" dur="6.841">to create the meaning there isn&apos;t some a</text><text start="1145.51" dur="5.83">priori God that said this is how you win</text><text start="1149.39" dur="3.87">the race at the end and you either get</text><text start="1151.34" dur="3.99">it right or you get it wrong by some you</text><text start="1153.26" dur="7.76">know predefined definition that can feel</text><text start="1155.33" dur="9.06">empowering there&apos;s actually some kind of</text><text start="1161.02" dur="5.26">metaphysics smuggled in there which is</text><text start="1164.39" dur="4.919">to say you get to create the meaning is</text><text start="1166.28" dur="4.769">still actually holding some concept of</text><text start="1169.309" dur="4.5">meaningfulness and the value on your own</text><text start="1171.049" dur="4.201">creativity right so there it&apos;s not</text><text start="1173.809" dur="3.901">actually doing the deeper inquiry to say</text><text start="1175.25" dur="4.98">well why do I value choice why do I</text><text start="1177.71" dur="8.04">value creativity and what is the basis</text><text start="1180.23" dur="7.47">for meaningfulness my own assessment so</text><text start="1185.75" dur="14.88">again those are just in prima facia held</text><text start="1187.7" dur="14.609">as meaningful so science is a process of</text><text start="1200.63" dur="6.419">trying to come to understand the</text><text start="1202.309" dur="7.261">objective world in a way that goes</text><text start="1207.049" dur="4.801">beyond my own subjective sense of what</text><text start="1209.57" dur="5.609">it is which means beyond my conditioning</text><text start="1211.85" dur="5.76">and my bias right and so I might think</text><text start="1215.179" dur="5.011">this sound travels faster than light at</text><text start="1217.61" dur="4.29">room temperature and air so I set up an</text><text start="1220.19" dur="3.84">experiment and measure it and I find out</text><text start="1221.9" dur="4.59">that it just doesn&apos;t and then I can do</text><text start="1224.03" dur="3.84">that a hundred times or a million times</text><text start="1226.49" dur="5.64">and other people can do it we can use</text><text start="1227.87" dur="6.0">different apparatus and there is a the</text><text start="1232.13" dur="3.15">measure ability and the repeatability</text><text start="1233.87" dur="5.939">gives us a certain sense of the</text><text start="1235.28" dur="6.3">objectivity of it right well so science</text><text start="1239.809" dur="5.131">has done a very good job of giving us a</text><text start="1241.58" dur="7.709">framework for is what is</text><text start="1244.94" dur="6.27">that is not based on what I think is it</text><text start="1249.289" dur="5.52">doesn&apos;t it hasn&apos;t given us the same</text><text start="1251.21" dur="7.889">basis for what ought to be and there&apos;s</text><text start="1254.809" dur="6.69">this classic division between science</text><text start="1259.099" dur="4.95">and ethics or science and existentialism</text><text start="1261.499" dur="4.29">called the is aught distinction science</text><text start="1264.049" dur="4.2">can say what is it can&apos;t say what aught</text><text start="1265.789" dur="5.181">because the process of science is a</text><text start="1268.249" dur="2.721">process of</text><text start="1271.81" dur="5.45">observing and measuring observable</text><text start="1274.87" dur="5.28">things which are inherently third-person</text><text start="1277.26"

and</text><text start="1287.29" dur="5.19">so it pertains to the domain of the</text><text start="1290.68" dur="4.239">things that are measurable and</text><text start="1292.48" dur="5.75">repeatable</text><text start="1294.919" dur="5.021">our experience isn&apos;t measurable its</text><text start="1298.23" dur="3.12">feelable its first person not third</text><text

is measurable because we can</text><text start="1305.669" dur="2.941">measure brain waves it&apos;s not measuring</text><text start="1307.049" dur="3.24">the experience that&apos;s measuring a brain</text><text start="1308.61" dur="4.819">state that happens to correlate with</text><text start="1310.289" dur="6.24">your felt experience but someone who</text><text start="1313.429" dur="6.161">studies the neuroscience of EEG s who&apos;s</text><text start="1316.529" dur="4.89">looking at the brain pattern of a Zen</text><text start="1319.59" dur="4.06">meditators can look at that and has no</text><text start="1321.419" dur="5.501">idea what the experience is like</text><text start="1323.65" dur="5.22">and so the fact that there might be some</text><text start="1326.92" dur="3.3">neural correlates to experience doesn&apos;t</text><text start="1328.87" dur="2.58">mean you&apos;re measuring the experience it</text><text start="1330.22" dur="2.31">means there&apos;s some neural correlate</text><text start="1331.45" dur="2.82">right but that&apos;s still the domain of</text><text start="1332.53" dur="5.46">third person which is fundamentally</text><text start="1334.27" dur="6.18">never first person</text><text start="1337.99" dur="6.21">so first person is outside of the domain</text><text start="1340.45" dur="6.54">of science formally this is important</text><text start="1344.2" dur="5.55">because it says science is not a method</text><text start="1346.99" dur="4.919">of knowing all of reality two method of</text><text start="1349.75" dur="3.779">knowing parts of reality and there&apos;s</text><text start="1351.909" dur="6.15">parts of reality that are rigorously</text><text start="1353.529" dur="6.421">outside of the methods of science but we</text><text start="1358.059" dur="3.691">want something like we had with science</text><text start="1359.95" dur="5.4">which was a better process of knowing</text><text start="1361.75" dur="5.76">and so are there better processes of</text><text start="1365.35" dur="4.17">knowing about the nature of first-person</text><text start="1367.51" dur="3.24">and the nature of the

the</text><text start="2713.85" dur="8.25">upper bound to what that can achieve is</text><text start="2716.55" dur="9.44">a body isn&apos;t just 70 or 90 trillion</text><text start="2722.1"
