business with world</text><text start="13.469" dur="11.101">leading experts hey everybody welcome to</text><text start="22.949" dur="3.0">another episode of venture stories by</text><text start="24.57" dur="2.19">village global I&apos;m here today with a</text><text start="25.949" dur="2.941">very special guest</text><text start="26.76" dur="4.41">Daniel schlotkin Berger Daniel is a</text><text start="28.89" dur="4.8">civilization designer interested in</text><text start="31.17" dur="4.11">social architecture and if you listen to</text><text start="33.69" dur="5.189">the episodes of jordan green hall and</text><text start="35.28" dur="5.88">jim rut you will love this episode then</text><text start="38.879" dur="5.131">welcome to the podcast thanks for having</text><text start="41.16" dur="6.09">and good to be here I want you to sort</text><text start="44.01" dur="4.47">of give people a bit more of who you are</text><text start="47.25" dur="3.989">and what you spend your time thinking</text><text start="48.48" dur="5.07">about so I want to ask a couple of</text><text start="51.239" dur="4.59">variations of a similar question and you</text><text start="53.55" dur="4.89">can answer whichever one you feel most</text><text start="55.829" dur="5.131">inspired to jump off from the first</text><text start="58.44" dur="4.38">variation of it is woody how did you</text><text start="60.96" dur="4.199">sort of when you define think about the</text><text start="62.82" dur="3.81">work that you do what sort of threads it</text><text start="65.159" dur="4.801">together what sort of the underlying</text><text start="66.63" dur="5.07">thread that you just keep pulling or an</text><text start="69.96" dur="3.24">another very that&apos;s looking back and</text><text start="71.7" dur="3.18">another variation of the question is</text><text start="73.2" dur="3.57">looking forward what are the current</text><text start="74.88" dur="4.129">questions that you are most wrestling</text><text start="76.77" dur="4.95">with you are spending your most time on</text><text start="79.009" dur="4.93">trying to trying to figure out and hope</text><text start="81.72" dur="3.689">that you know many years from now when</text><text start="83.939" dur="2.79">you were retrospectively looking back at</text><text start="85.409" dur="3.721">the the work that you&apos;ve done</text><text start="86.729" dur="4.801">hope you&apos;ve you know taken a stab at or</text><text start="89.13" dur="6.48">or made a dent in in in terms of your</text><text start="91.53" dur="6.87">contribution sure I think one way of</text><text start="95.61" dur="8.299">talking about the central thread is how</text><text start="98.4" dur="10.71">do we best help improve humanities</text><text start="103.909" dur="7.03">wisdom the way that we individually and</text><text start="109.11" dur="4.5">as various groups and all the way up to</text><text start="110.939" dur="4.561">collectively make sense of what is</text><text start="113.61" dur="4.98">important and meaningful what&apos;s going on</text><text start="115.5" dur="4.409">what the what a good design our strategy</text><text start="118.59" dur="4.29">to serve what&apos;s meaningful without</text><text start="119.909" dur="4.771">causing other problems is and how do we</text><text start="122.88" dur="4.769">make choices and coordinate joyce&apos;s</text><text start="124.68" dur="6.809">effectively towards a better world of</text><text start="127.649" dur="5.521">the initiative world and so basically</text><text start="131.489" dur="4.021">all of the</text><text start="133.17" dur="4.44">sources of unnecessary suffering and</text><text start="135.51" dur="4.77">particularly human induced unnecessary</text><text start="137.61" dur="5.73">suffering kind of all or intolerable to</text><text start="140.28" dur="5.57">me have always been and there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="143.34" dur="5.61">them right everything from the animal</text><text start="145.85" dur="7.2">rights species extinction factory farm</text><text start="148.95" dur="6.39">stuff to environmental devastation to</text><text start="153.05" dur="4.45">untoward that could have been solved for</text><text start="155.34" dur="5.39">other reasons that have economic</text><text start="157.5" dur="5.58">incentives and whatever to to the</text><text start="160.73" dur="3.91">escalation of those with increasing</text><text start="163.08" dur="3.72">population and technology and</text><text start="164.64" dur="4.17">globalization and fragility that looks</text><text start="166.8" dur="6.84">like catastrophic and existential risks</text><text start="168.81" dur="7.02">and given that they there are so many</text><text start="173.64" dur="4.5">that they&apos;re really unsolvable at the</text><text start="175.83" dur="4.65">level of each particular instance I have</text><text start="178.14" dur="3.87">been interested in not just how are they</text><text start="180.48" dur="3.539">interconnected but what is underneath</text><text start="182.01" dur="3.63">and driving why humans are behaving in</text><text start="184.019" dur="4.981">ways that generate those problems and</text><text start="185.64" dur="5.04">that don&apos;t solve them and so you know</text><text start="189.0" dur="4.98">you use the term civilization design</text><text start="190.68" dur="5.88">which is if we look at say species</text><text start="193.98" dur="5.039">extinction species extinction whether</text><text start="196.56" dur="4.769">we&apos;re talking about the decrease in</text><text start="199.019" dur="4.351">whale populations or cutting down of</text><text start="201.329" dur="5.431">old-growth forests or whatever and</text><text start="203.37" dur="5.1">whether we killed the theme for the</text><text start="206.76" dur="3.3">direct commoditization of it or we</text><text start="208.47" dur="3.329">killed the habitat land it was because</text><text start="210.06" dur="4.38">nature was worth more dead than alive so</text><text start="211.799" dur="4.321">we had a perverse incentive situation we</text><text start="214.44" dur="5.22">can see a lot of situations where war is</text><text start="216.12" dur="5.369">great for GDP and not war would be bad</text><text start="219.66" dur="4.2">for GDP we&apos;re sick people are better for</text><text start="221.489" dur="5.461">GDP where addiction is better for GDP</text><text start="223.86" dur="6.39">where and GDP as a whole in an aggregate</text><text start="226.95" dur="5.25">or particular groups and so we start to</text><text start="230.25" dur="3.329">look at Oh underneath lots of problems</text><text start="232.2" dur="3.629">in the world is perverse incentive</text><text start="233.579" dur="4.081">economic but also political etc so</text><text start="235.829" dur="4.5">issues associated with differential</text><text start="237.66" dur="4.38">power and the ability for some agent to</text><text start="240.329" dur="3.961">get ahead at the expense of other agents</text><text start="242.04" dur="3.72">or the Commons and then everybody</text><text start="244.29" dur="3.21">playing those types of games up</text><text start="245.76" dur="3.84">ratcheting their capacity to get ahead</text><text start="247.5" dur="3.81">at the cost of more expense being</text><text start="249.6" dur="3.419">externalized and you&apos;re not just talking</text><text start="251.31" dur="3.149">about short term versus long term GDP</text><text start="253.019" dur="4.141">you&apos;re talking about this fundamental</text><text start="254.459" dur="4.141">misalignment at times between what&apos;s</text><text start="257.16" dur="4.379">best for long term b2b or what&apos;s best</text><text start="258.6" dur="5.73">for long term you know civilization well</text><text start="261.539" dur="5.281">interestingly what is best for long term</text><text start="264.33" dur="6.12">consideration and what&apos;s best for others</text><text start="266.82" dur="5.4">often times correspond because I might</text><text start="270.45" dur="3.69">have a situation where what seems like</text><text start="272.22" dur="4.53">the rational best choice for me in the</text><text start="274.14" dur="4.5">short term that ends up damaging the</text><text start="276.75" dur="3.42">Commons or others also damages my</text><text start="278.64" dur="3.54">possibility space in the long term</text><text start="280.17" dur="5.7">because now I live on a ecologically</text><text start="282.18" dur="6.57">devastated planet or now I&apos;ve engendered</text><text start="285.87" dur="4.65">more enmity from the other groups that I</text><text start="288.75" dur="4.95">won the battle but have not won the war</text><text start="290.52" dur="4.89">and I deployed the asymmetric technology</text><text start="293.7" dur="4.71">now they reverse engineered and are</text><text start="295.41" dur="5.22">gonna deploy it back so we have these</text><text start="298.41" dur="4.26">situations where every agent doing the</text><text start="300.63" dur="4.14">thing that seems like the rational best</text><text start="302.67" dur="5.49">choice in the short term just focusing</text><text start="304.77" dur="4.89">on them creates the worst possibility</text><text start="308.16" dur="3.33">space for the whole over the long term</text><text start="309.66" dur="3.51">so this is an example of the like</text><text start="311.49" dur="3.21">coordination failures that are</text><text start="313.17" dur="3.84">underneath most of the problems in the</text><text start="314.7" dur="4.38">world I don&apos;t want to cut all of the</text><text start="317.01" dur="4.02">trees down and I don&apos;t need to but if I</text><text start="319.08" dur="4.41">don&apos;t the other guy&apos;s going to so me not</text><text start="321.03" dur="3.72">doing it doesn&apos;t leave a forest and then</text><text start="323.49" dur="3.36">he&apos;s gonna use his increased economic</text><text start="324.75" dur="3.66">power to beat me in some other important</text><text start="326.85" dur="4.11">ways so now we actually race to cut it</text><text start="328.41" dur="4.41">down as fast as possible or do we see</text><text start="330.96" dur="3.51">tragedy of the Commons type scenarios or</text><text start="332.82" dur="4.02">we have to race to build the AI weapons</text><text start="334.47" dur="4.47">before the other guy so arms races</text><text start="336.84" dur="5.4">tragedy of the Commons are examples of</text><text start="338.94" dur="5.37">multipolar traps where no one is</text><text start="342.24" dur="3.63">maliciously doing the bad thing and yet</text><text start="344.31" dur="3.45">everyone&apos;s racing to do the disruptive</text><text start="345.87" dur="4.8">things I think they start codecs called</text><text start="347.76" dur="5.85">this Moloch yes the meditations on</text><text start="350.67" dur="4.23">Moloch is required reading yeah and so</text><text start="353.61" dur="3.63">you know you asked me before we started</text><text start="354.9" dur="3.99">talking how I discovered your work and I</text><text start="357.24" dur="3.12">mentioned I would crypto Rabideau would</text><text start="358.89" dur="3.63">let me do the gaming rathole and I</text><text start="360.36" dur="4.44">discovered you know a few years ago sort</text><text start="362.52" dur="4.14">of this literature around progress and</text><text start="364.8" dur="4.08">and Tyler Cowen and his book stubborn</text><text start="366.66" dur="4.61">attachments and how you know improving</text><text start="368.88" dur="5.34">economic growth and GDP and</text><text start="371.27" dur="4.66">technological progress was the you know</text><text start="374.22" dur="3.69">highly correlated with so many things</text><text start="375.93" dur="4.89">that we we care about you know in firma</text><text start="377.91" dur="5.49">tality healthcare I mean so so many</text><text start="380.82" dur="4.53">great things about the world and you</text><text start="383.4" dur="4.35">know I read things like you know</text><text start="385.35" dur="3.96">Geoffrey West scale where it said you</text><text start="387.75" dur="3.96">know says that economic growth is</text><text start="389.31" dur="4.14">inherently unsustainable you try to</text><text start="391.71" dur="3.54">innovate your way through it but you</text><text start="393.45" dur="3.9">know that you&apos;ll reach some limits but</text><text start="395.25" dur="5.29">then I read things like Andrew McAfee&apos;s</text><text start="397.35" dur="5.68">more from West&apos;s where it says hey</text><text start="400.54" dur="4.44">you know we&apos;ve now decoupled resource</text><text start="403.03" dur="4.29">consumption or resource usage from</text><text start="404.98" dur="4.2">consumption and I don&apos;t know who to</text><text start="407.32" dur="4.17">believe right now that no to believe but</text><text start="409.18" dur="3.93">who&apos;s right which do we get to innovate</text><text start="411.49" dur="3.93">through it is the only way out is</text><text start="413.11" dur="4.53">through or do you have to sub you know</text><text start="415.42" dur="3.99">have this radical Reformation of how we</text><text start="417.64" dur="4.92">how we run our economy more Charles</text><text start="419.41" dur="5.58">Eisenstein stuff and so that&apos;s my</text><text start="422.56" dur="4.56">question to you then how do you think</text><text start="424.99" dur="4.52">about that yeah so let&apos;s talk about</text><text start="427.12" dur="6.6">limits of growth and upper bounds and</text><text start="429.51" dur="7.93">that kind of question so obviously the</text><text start="433.72" dur="5.64">growth of the materials economy and the</text><text start="437.44" dur="5.43">domain of atoms is different than in the</text><text start="439.36" dur="5.52">domain of bits and we would be silly to</text><text start="442.87" dur="3.18">not acknowledge that fundamental</text><text start="444.88" dur="3.45">difference and there&apos;s a third</text><text start="446.05" dur="4.29">difference in terms of the physics of</text><text start="448.33" dur="3.66">the materials economy the domain of</text><text start="450.34" dur="3.48">atoms the domain of energy and the</text><text start="451.99" dur="3.42">domain of bits all have fundamentally</text><text start="453.82" dur="3.21">different scarcities and different</text><text start="455.41" dur="2.88">thermodynamics Associated different</text><text start="457.03" dur="3.68">conservation laws so we have two</text><text start="458.29" dur="5.91">different accounting for them we have a</text><text start="460.71" dur="6.97">finite amount of atoms of various types</text><text start="464.2" dur="6.06">and of course via better mining</text><text start="467.68" dur="3.84">technologies whatever and turning the</text><text start="470.26" dur="2.7">atoms and the molecules for better</text><text start="471.52" dur="3.18">chemistry type technologies we can</text><text start="472.96" dur="3.48">modulate that to some degree but we also</text><text start="474.7" dur="3.03">have upper bounds on that it&apos;s also</text><text start="476.44" dur="2.76">important to realize that it&apos;s not just</text><text start="477.73" dur="2.91">getting the atoms that&apos;s what do we do</text><text start="479.2" dur="5.1">with them after the fact which is the</text><text start="480.64" dur="5.52">waste management so for the most part so</text><text start="484.3" dur="4.53">far humanity&apos;s had a linear materials</text><text start="486.16" dur="4.68">economy where we take resources out of</text><text start="488.83" dur="4.77">the earth in a way that are not renewing</text><text start="490.84" dur="5.79">themselves which is a ultimately causing</text><text start="493.6" dur="5.34">net depletion and then we use them for</text><text start="496.63" dur="3.84">some time a period of time and then we</text><text start="498.94" dur="3.12">put them back into the earth in a way</text><text start="500.47" dur="3.84">that they can&apos;t actually be reabsorbed</text><text start="502.06" dur="5.28">properly so toxicity net accumulation</text><text start="504.31" dur="5.34">the depletion and accumulation in the</text><text start="507.34" dur="4.71">ecosystem where the ecosystem before</text><text start="509.65" dur="5.4">humans doing a materials economy had</text><text start="512.05" dur="4.679">closed-loop process as the the animals</text><text start="515.05" dur="4.14">the plants the fungus is that everything</text><text start="516.729" dur="4.321">in an ecosystem are made of the same</text><text start="519.19" dur="4.74">atomic ingredients and can be fully</text><text start="521.05" dur="4.47">recycled and so anything dies and it</text><text start="523.93" dur="3.3">becomes food for new things and the food</text><text start="525.52" dur="3.57">for new things doesn&apos;t try to figure out</text><text start="527.23" dur="3.21">how to mine and get like savings</text><text start="529.09" dur="3.09">accounts in very effective ways because</text><text start="530.44" dur="3.3">they don&apos;t have to Lin evasion so you</text><text start="532.18" dur="2.28">get these kind of clothes we process as</text><text start="533.74" dur="2.33">this issue</text><text start="534.46" dur="4.89">part of the antifragility of how</text><text start="536.07" dur="4.9">Ecology&apos;s work so obviously we have to</text><text start="539.35" dur="3.9">move from a linear materials economy to</text><text start="540.97" dur="4.29">a closed-loop economy that&apos;s pretty</text><text start="543.25" dur="3.99">straightforward where we take</text><text start="545.26" dur="4.28">responsibility for closed-loop on the</text><text start="547.24" dur="4.47">atomic cycles so we aren&apos;t producing</text><text start="549.54" dur="5.11">accumulation on one side or depletion on</text><text start="551.71" dur="4.5">the other now we can keep cycling them</text><text start="554.65" dur="3.75">so we don&apos;t have a situation that once</text><text start="556.21" dur="3.69">we&apos;ve used it it&apos;s gone right but we do</text><text start="558.4" dur="4.02">have a situation where we start moving</text><text start="559.9" dur="5.19">from increased growth of the number of</text><text start="562.42" dur="5.28">atoms in measuring growth or progress in</text><text start="565.09" dur="4.47">terms of the number of atoms to that the</text><text start="567.7" dur="4.71">atoms are being put into continuously</text><text start="569.56" dur="4.86">more interesting forms the forms are</text><text start="572.41" dur="5.19">defined by design that is stored in a</text><text start="574.42" dur="5.31">pattern of bits and obviously the bits</text><text start="577.6" dur="5.1">don&apos;t have a similar type of fundamental</text><text start="579.73" dur="4.32">limit to them than the atoms do so atoms</text><text start="582.7" dur="4.44">we have to think about closed-loop</text><text start="584.05" dur="6.87">accounting on now to be able to process</text><text start="587.14" dur="6.96">the old stuff into new stuff atomically</text><text start="590.92" dur="6.84">takes energy energy has a different kind</text><text start="594.1" dur="6.09">of conservation to it which is that we</text><text start="597.76" dur="4.11">get a finite amount of energy bandwidth</text><text start="600.19" dur="3.66">every day we can use it more efficiently</text><text start="601.87" dur="4.47">solar and you know other types of things</text><text start="603.85" dur="4.56">but we don&apos;t have an indefinite amount</text><text start="606.34" dur="3.51">of energy so we have to be cycling the</text><text start="608.41" dur="2.88">atoms within a limited energetic</text><text start="609.85" dur="3.66">bandwidth and we have basically</text><text start="611.29" dur="5.4">unlimited amount of bit pattern limited</text><text start="613.51" dur="5.07">only by the energy and atom needs of the</text><text start="616.69" dur="5.04">computational substrate but then the</text><text start="618.58" dur="6.41">bits are only useful in so far as they</text><text start="621.73" dur="5.76">can actually be put into form and or</text><text start="624.99" dur="4.15">there is limited human attention to be</text><text start="627.49" dur="4.17">able to engage them as types of software</text><text start="629.14" dur="5.04">and so human attention becomes another</text><text start="631.66" dur="6.18">fundamental scarcity that is part of</text><text start="634.18" dur="6.99">this equation and so when people look at</text><text start="637.84" dur="5.22">things like the fundamentally non-rival</text><text start="641.17" dur="4.53">risk nature of software</text><text start="643.06" dur="4.77">you can&apos;t abstract that to the domain of</text><text start="645.7" dur="3.27">energy or atoms right like you really</text><text start="647.83" dur="3.39">have to think about these in the</text><text start="648.97"

no</text><text start="825.98" dur="5.88">self-correcting nature of a market there</text><text start="827.689" dur="6.45">also when you think about fundamental</text><text start="831.86"

dur="5.081">then some of the companies will succeed</text><text start="865.009" dur="4.41">in to that survival selection and some</text><text start="867.29" dur="3.57">won&apos;t and then a couple

dur="5.04">the whole in the near term in the long</text><text start="1299.98" dur="6.24">term and what we&apos;re actually asking is</text><text start="1303.52" dur="4.649">how do we remove choice and make a</text><text start="1306.22" dur="5.1">system that predisposes everyone&apos;s</text><text start="1308.169" dur="5.64">choice in a particular way and as long</text><text start="1311.32"

the</text><text start="1329.53" dur="4.499">more tangible in a moment but I think</text><text start="1332.649" dur="4.2">you&apos;ll find</text><text start="1334.029" dur="5.52">that if you try to define meaningfulness</text><text start="1336.849" dur="4.83">like the meaningfulness of existence of</text><text start="1339.549" dur="4.98">life you won&apos;t be able to find any</text><text

so insofar as we are we would</text><text start="1351.309" dur="4.41">seek to make a system that actually</text><text start="1353.369" dur="5.17">compels people&apos;s choice to be a</text><text

start="1373.869" dur="5.16">to look at a bunch of metrics not just</text><text start="1376.929" dur="3.48">GDP but i&apos;m gonna look at a bunch of</text><text start="1379.029" dur="3.09">things that

actually</text><text start="1590.83" dur="5.67">matter that are not measurable they&apos;re</text><text start="1594.04" dur="4.68">not quantifiable there are kinds of</text><text start="1596.5"

see that very</text><text start="1663.22" dur="5.67">fundamental to something just like the</text><text start="1666.19" dur="5.07">idea of currency is conditioning choice</text><text start="1668.89" dur="4.35">in a way that is not what we would call</text><text start="1671.26" dur="4.23">being a steward of good choice that if</text><text start="1673.24" dur="4.14">we look at wisdom from any tradition any</text><text start="1675.49" dur="3.63">kind of good thinking on what wisdom is</text><text start="1677.38" dur="4.32">it would have people make choices that</text><text start="1679.12" dur="5.82">are not fully based on the type of</text><text start="1681.7" dur="6.66">metric accounting so if someone has a</text><text start="1684.94" dur="4.98">fiduciary responsibility to utilize</text><text start="1688.36" dur="3.45">their resources and they have now</text><text start="1689.92" dur="4.08">quantified the value of other people&apos;s</text><text start="1691.81" dur="4.05">lives as human resources in terms of</text><text start="1694.0" dur="4.14">their hours and what they get paid and</text><text start="1695.86" dur="5.16">whatever we&apos;ve quantified you know all</text><text start="1698.14" dur="6.66">of those types of resources and they</text><text start="1701.02" dur="5.49">have to maximize shareholder returns as</text><text start="1704.8" dur="5.94">part of a fiduciary responsibility they</text><text start="1706.51" dur="6.33">will be obligated to destroy real value</text><text start="1710.74" dur="3.99">in service of the types of

dur="6.6">this is just one of a lot of examples of</text><text start="1720.61" dur="7.47">why you can&apos;t leave choice to a system</text><text start="1724.06" dur="5.73">the and yet why it was also very hard to</text><text start="1728.08" dur="4.35">develop humans it would make choice</text><text start="1729.79" dur="4.2">outside of what Moloc or the paperclip</text><text start="1732.43" dur="2.999">Maximizer of the system Orion</text><text start="1733.99" dur="3.36">yeah there&apos;s a version of this in</text><text start="1735.429" dur="4.051">Silicon Valley which is you know

can&apos;t really</text><text start="1746.77" dur="4.44">measure it and so there&apos;s this conundrum</text><text start="1748.75" dur="4.61">there do you try to find better ways to</text><text start="1751.21" dur="4.469">measure the things that are unmeasurable</text><text start="1753.36" dur="4.66">hoping that you&apos;ll then prioritize it</text><text start="1755.679" dur="3.63">and not corrupt it in the process do you</text><text start="1758.02" dur="2.7">just acknowledge that there are certain</text><text start="1759.309" dur="2.85">things that you&apos;ll never be able to</text><text start="1760.72" dur="4.14">measure and you need to find ways to</text><text start="1762.159" dur="4.921">prioritize it or do you get rid of all</text><text start="1764.86" dur="4.41">metrics altogether and yet that seems</text><text start="1767.08" dur="4.17">exactly these all seem like a perfect</text><text start="1769.27" dur="4.289">solution of course you don&apos;t get rid of</text><text start="1771.25" dur="4.23">all metrics but you have a choice making</text><text start="1773.559" dur="4.35">process that is informed by but not</text><text start="1775.48" dur="5.579">determined by the metrics because there</text><text start="1777.909" dur="5.311">will be a general intelligence capacity</text><text start="1781.059" dur="3.451">to look at all the metrics and say there</text><text start="1783.22" dur="4.079">are things that matter that are not</text><text start="1784.51" dur="5.01">being captured here adequately and I can</text><text start="1787.299" dur="3.961">understand qualified things that aren&apos;t</text><text start="1789.52" dur="3.12">quantified I can understand some</text><text start="1791.26" dur="2.85">quantified things that I just paid</text><text start="1792.64" dur="5.13">attention to that aren&apos;t on my dashboard</text><text start="1794.11" dur="6.48">of metrics to look at I can understand</text><text start="1797.77" dur="4.379">that my simplified algorithm is probably</text><text start="1800.59" dur="4.14">actually really wrong that&apos;s paying</text><text start="1802.149" dur="5.551">attention to how I did an economic model</text><text start="1804.73" dur="6.15">or whatever it is and so the ability to</text><text start="1807.7" dur="4.26">hold responsibility for choice and this</text><text start="1810.88" dur="3.09">is one of the other things is that</text><text start="1811.96" dur="5.13">people actually get out of ethical</text><text start="1813.97" dur="6.48">responsibility even to their their own</text><text start="1817.09" dur="6.42">self by creating a decision-making</text><text start="1820.45" dur="5.219">system that they have to follow when</text><text start="1823.51" dur="3.99">that says troops were being tried in the</text><text start="1825.669" dur="3.87">hague after world war ii and they were</text><text start="1827.5" dur="3.57">being asked about war crimes they were</text><text start="1829.539" dur="3.931">all asked did you believe in everything</text><text start="1831.07" dur="4.079">that you did and 90% of them said no we</text><text start="1833.47" dur="2.88">actually like we started too and then we</text><text start="1835.149" dur="2.76">didn&apos;t believe in it and then they were</text><text start="1836.35" dur="3.0">asked did you try and stop and all of</text><text start="1837.909" dur="3.24">them said no we didn&apos;t try and stop and</text><text start="1839.35" dur="3.209">then when asked why they quoted the</text><text

moment that you say fiduciary</text><text start="1846.22" dur="4.829">responsibility or company policy or this</text><text start="1849.19" dur="4.469">is what I gotta do to you know compete</text><text start="1851.049" dur="5.13">with the market you can be a Nazi right</text><text start="1853.659" dur="4.02">you can actually remove all ethical</text><text start="1856.179" dur="4.651">culpability by saying you don&apos;t have a</text><text start="1857.679" dur="5.25">choice so the question was how do we</text><text start="1860.83" dur="3.959">develop good stewards of

dur="3.12">we could go deeper into this but in a</text><text start="2632.67" dur="3.21">general sense we can think about</text><text start="2634.23" dur="3.66">evolution as an unconscious

start="2669.99" dur="5.43">and tool-making so we can think of we</text><text start="2673.95" dur="4.71">can think of evolution as a kind of</text><text start="2675.42" dur="7.32">decentralized unconscious parallel</text><text start="2678.66" dur="5.45">process but that is actually tending to</text><text start="2682.74" dur="4.08">the meta stability of the whole</text><text start="2684.11"

dur="6.87">to understand that so there is a new</text><text start="2713.7" dur="5.52">third creative process so if we say that</text><text start="2716.64" dur="5.43">evolution is unconscious tending

dur="4.26">and tool-making is conscious creation of</text><text start="2725.82" dur="3.57">parts then there has to be a new process</text><text start="2727.92" dur="4.38">that is the conscious

dur="5.34">regulating their capacity but breaking</text><text start="2737.04" dur="4.71">the power symmetry that is where the</text><text start="2739.77" dur="3.72">meta stability comes and not thinking of</text><text start="2741.75" dur="4.2">the long-term of the whole and it when</text><text start="2743.49" dur="5.07">anyone deploys more asymmetrical power</text><text start="2745.95" dur="4.56">power everyone then ends up reverse</text><text start="2748.56" dur="3.21">engineering it also deploying it you get</text><text start="2750.51" dur="2.7">this exponential curve of

dur="4.47">ends so as soon as we can affect the</text><text start="2758.49" dur="3.9">whole that significantly there has to be</text><text start="2760.5" dur="2.88">conscious governance of how that occurs</text><text start="2762.39" dur="4.2">which is where there has to be</text><text start="2763.38" dur="6.39">large-scale sense-making and large scale</text><text start="2766.59"

curious we</text><text start="3117.03" dur="3.9">unpack that a little bit wouldn&apos;t be</text><text start="3119.61" dur="3.03">where it comes from or why it&apos;s false</text><text start="3120.93" dur="3.66">and then mention if we think about</text><text start="3122.64" dur="4.83">science is one tool in the toolkit is</text><text start="3124.59" dur="4.02">there what&apos;s another important tool how</text><text start="3127.47" dur="3.39">do you think about that that&apos;s woke up</text><text start="3128.61" dur="4.64">broadly in terms of you good choice</text><text start="3130.86" dur="5.4">making and then maybe this is related to</text><text start="3133.25" dur="5.02">and I know this is a huge topic so it&apos;s</text><text start="3136.26" dur="3.69">a little bit of an injustice to just</text><text start="3138.27" dur="4.98">shrink it to a minute but if you could</text><text start="3139.95" dur="5.58">sort of write the crux of what you find</text><text start="3143.25" dur="3.84">really interesting about forest Landers</text><text start="3145.53" dur="7.5">work or what you think is contribution</text><text start="3147.09" dur="15.09">is I accept that&apos;s related yeah in terms</text><text start="3153.03" dur="13.98">of the need to have a ethical system</text><text start="3162.18" dur="6.75">that is commensurable that is able to</text><text start="3167.01" dur="6.35">have logical congruence with the</text><text start="3168.93" dur="6.33">philosophy of science so that the</text><text start="3173.36" dur="4.06">philosophy that gives rise to our</text><text start="3175.26" dur="4.71">ability to make more powerful choices is</text><text start="3177.42" dur="5.19">also connected to the ability to make</text><text start="3179.97" dur="5.01">better choices working towards that in a</text><text start="3182.61" dur="6.21">meaningful way is one of the areas that</text><text start="3184.98" dur="6.21">forests work has been that I think is</text><text start="3188.82" dur="4.05">most meaningful of a contribution</text><text start="3191.19" dur="5.19">there&apos;s lots of things I think a very</text><text start="3192.87" dur="5.64">meaningful contribution and so you know</text><text start="3196.38" dur="3.72">again we said the philosophy of science</text><text start="3198.51" dur="3.18">looks at the domain of the measurable</text><text start="3200.1" dur="4.41">and repeatable or we can say the domain</text><text start="3201.69" dur="4.119">of measurable repeatable specifically</text><text start="3204.51" dur="5.499">which is always going to be third</text><text start="3205.809" dur="6.871">and so there are some philosophical</text><text start="3210.009" dur="5.31">assumptions about what third-person</text><text start="3212.68" dur="4.289">means what first-person means and what</text><text start="3215.319" dur="4.111">the relationship between first and third</text><text start="3216.969" dur="4.59">person are or reifying what we mean by</text><text start="3219.43" dur="3.539">subjective what we mean by objective and</text><text start="3221.559" dur="5.04">what the relationship between subjective</text><text start="3222.969" dur="6.99">and objective are that forests work</text><text start="3226.599" dur="6.531">starts at that level and the reification</text><text start="3229.959" dur="5.49">gives the basis to then be able to</text><text start="3233.13" dur="3.909">ground the philosophy of science and</text><text start="3235.449" dur="2.88">something deeper than it like well</text><text start="3237.039" dur="2.94">obviously if we&apos;re looking at the domain</text><text start="3238.329" dur="3.091">of measurable and repeatable we we have</text><text start="3239.979" dur="3.47">to start with measurable and the</text><text start="3241.42" dur="4.409">measurement always involves a measure or</text><text start="3243.449" dur="4.12">measuring some measured there&apos;s a</text><text start="3245.829" dur="3.72">triplicate relationship between the</text><text start="3247.569" dur="5.19">observed the process of observation and</text><text start="3249.549" dur="7.351">the observer and yet then what we try to</text><text start="3252.759" dur="6.0">do is take for the most part the</text><text start="3256.9" dur="4.98">measurement process and especially the</text><text start="3258.759" dur="6.98">measure for granted and create an</text><text start="3261.88" dur="6.389">ontology of measures even though the</text><text start="3265.739" dur="5.641">fundamental basis of the concept of</text><text start="3268.269" dur="5.7">measurement itself isn&apos;t even</text><text start="3271.38" dur="4.239">semantically frame abaut in a logical</text><text start="3273.969" dur="4.951">way without those three concepts being</text><text start="3275.619" dur="6.0">bound so it&apos;s very interesting if you</text><text start="3278.92" dur="4.439">look at kind of vedanta kai deal ism or</text><text start="3281.619" dur="3.33">buddhist idealism or solipsism in</text><text start="3283.359" dur="3.45">general on one side and you look at</text><text start="3284.949" dur="3.211">physicalism on the other side i would</text><text start="3286.809" dur="6.47">say that they make the exact same</text><text start="3288.16" dur="8.909">reductive mistake so physicalism says</text><text start="3293.279" dur="7.121">that objective or physical is</text><text start="3297.069" dur="6.061">fundamentally real and subjective is</text><text start="3300.4" dur="6.059">either not real like it&apos;s just an</text><text start="3303.13" dur="7.109">illusion all uh you know radical limit</text><text start="3306.459" dur="7.921">of ism or it&apos;s an epiphenomena it&apos;s a</text><text start="3310.239" dur="5.94">you know secondary and they have a very</text><text start="3314.38" dur="4.609">compelling argument for that right the</text><text start="3316.179" dur="6.12">compelling argument is it requires</text><text start="3318.989" dur="4.99">assuming a bunch of things as more</text><text start="3322.299" dur="6.51">epistemic ly grounded than I think they</text><text start="3323.979" dur="7.05">are but so BIGBANG just a bunch of</text><text start="3328.809" dur="3.69">plasma and then particles and whatever</text><text start="3331.029" dur="3.17">it doesn&apos;t seem like there&apos;s anything we</text><text start="3332.499" dur="5.0">can call consciousness and they&apos;re</text><text start="3334.199" dur="5.321">eventually planets at a certain point</text><text start="3337.499" dur="4.721">hydrological biological process</text><text start="3339.52" dur="4.47">protocells whatever it&apos;s very hard to</text><text start="3342.22" dur="3.72">think about consciousness before that so</text><text start="3343.99" dur="3.57">it seems like there was physical stuff</text><text start="3345.94" dur="3.27">before there was consciousness stuff so</text><text start="3347.56" dur="5.28">then consciousness must have emerged out</text><text start="3349.21" dur="5.22">of there and if people can describe</text><text start="3352.84" dur="3.63">their subjective experience while hooked</text><text start="3354.43" dur="3.39">up to an EEG or an fMRI and we can look</text><text start="3356.47" dur="2.7">at their brain and we can see some type</text><text start="3357.82" dur="3.06">of statistical correlation between</text><text start="3359.17" dur="3.45">patterns of brain and their subjective</text><text start="3360.88" dur="3.33">experience and we can say there&apos;s a</text><text start="3362.62" dur="3.27">correlation between subjective and</text><text start="3364.21" dur="3.87">objective but we think that the</text><text start="3365.89" dur="4.43">objective is controlled by the objective</text><text start="3368.08" dur="5.19">ie that physics is causally closed</text><text start="3370.32" dur="4.33">therefore your brain state this moment</text><text start="3373.27" dur="5.19">as the result of your brain state a</text><text start="3374.65" dur="6.89">moment ago and the particle physics that</text><text start="3378.46" dur="5.07">governs you know ion differentials of</text><text start="3381.54" dur="4.45">what&apos;s going to actually happen in the</text><text start="3383.53" dur="4.77">brain in relationship with the body in</text><text start="3385.99" dur="4.49">the environment so if there is a</text><text start="3388.3" dur="5.04">one-for-one correlation between</text><text start="3390.48" dur="4.66">described subjective States and observed</text><text start="3393.34" dur="3.33">objective States and the objective</text><text start="3395.14" dur="3.63">states are the result of scientific</text><text start="3396.67" dur="6.18">causation and this closure over that</text><text start="3398.77" dur="6.72">then subjectivity must be a a causal</text><text start="3402.85" dur="4.92">epiphenomena right like there&apos;s various</text><text start="3405.49" dur="5.58">versions of that argument and as you can</text><text start="3407.77" dur="6.21">see you know argument between Sam Harris</text><text start="3411.07" dur="6.0">and M Dan Dennett who both would</text><text start="3413.98" dur="4.68">typically think of themselves as being</text><text start="3417.07" dur="4.32">mostly informed by the philosophy of</text><text start="3418.66" dur="4.98">science come to you know Dan Dennett</text><text start="3421.39" dur="4.44">says that consciousness is not real but</text><text start="3423.64" dur="5.16">free will is and Sam says free will is</text><text start="3425.83" dur="5.58">not real but consciousness is and at the</text><text start="3428.8" dur="4.23">end of their argument Sam said something</text><text start="3431.41" dur="3.21">like it appears we have fundamentally</text><text start="3433.03" dur="3.09">different intuitions on this which is</text><text start="3434.62" dur="4.38">actually very important which meant that</text><text start="3436.12" dur="4.71">the symbol grounding was actually the</text><text start="3439.0" dur="3.6">the key thing and this is where you get</text><text start="3440.83" dur="3.83">tarce Keys theorem you know coming out</text><text start="3442.6" dur="5.07">of girdle&apos;s theorem which is that any</text><text start="3444.66" dur="4.63">formal logical system involves ideas</text><text start="3447.67" dur="4.44">that cannot be reified in that system</text><text start="3449.29" dur="4.71">and that means that there is no logical</text><text start="3452.11" dur="5.82">system that is consistent that&apos;s also</text><text start="3454.0" dur="6.12">complete and I now this comes back to I</text><text start="3457.93" dur="3.93">said there is no perfect social system</text><text start="3460.12" dur="3.54">and it comes back to why the first thing</text><text start="3461.86" dur="3.87">Lao Tzu said when he wrote this book is</text><text start="3463.66" dur="5.16">that the DAO that is nameable as eternal</text><text start="3465.73" dur="4.72">Dao is the formal system that is</text><text start="3468.82" dur="5.62">complete</text><text start="3470.45" dur="8.73">doesn&apos;t exist right okay so we can see</text><text start="3474.44" dur="6.66">how basically philosophy of science is</text><text start="3479.18" dur="3.42">and obviously I&apos;m radically</text><text start="3481.1" dur="4.98">oversimplifying to go quickly and we can</text><text start="3482.6" dur="5.76">do the nuance thing at some point so the</text><text start="3486.08" dur="3.66">question what is real philosophy of</text><text start="3488.36" dur="3.12">science says well the stuff that is</text><text start="3489.74" dur="3.3">measurable and repeatable seems to be</text><text start="3491.48" dur="3.42">pretty clearly real because we might</text><text start="3493.04" dur="3.54">think that sound is faster than light</text><text start="3494.9" dur="4.43">but we can all measure that it&apos;s not and</text><text start="3496.58" dur="5.82">it&apos;s the same every time and so the the</text><text start="3499.33" dur="4.81">congruence of objectivity and the</text><text start="3502.4" dur="3.42">repeatability of it and its independence</text><text start="3504.14" dur="4.29">to our beliefs about it seems like a</text><text start="3505.82" dur="3.96">good basis for real and then the fact</text><text start="3508.43" dur="3.06">that we can make predictions with it and</text><text start="3509.78" dur="4.56">make out of it and that works and</text><text start="3511.49" dur="6.57">whatever and so then of course you have</text><text start="3514.34" dur="5.91">an epistemology which is measuring and</text><text start="3518.06" dur="4.71">repeating and then testing and you know</text><text start="3520.25" dur="5.04">like that which is given epistemology of</text><text start="3522.77" dur="4.11">third person that is the epistemology</text><text start="3525.29" dur="3.57">that makes sense starting with the</text><text start="3526.88" dur="3.42">oncologic assumption that what is real</text><text start="3528.86" dur="4.08">is the stuff that you can assess me</text><text start="3530.3" dur="4.77">about epistemology and so then you do a</text><text start="3532.94" dur="3.96">bunch of third-person assessment and all</text><text start="3535.07" dur="3.72">you find is causation and third-person</text><text start="3536.9" dur="4.14">and so of course you end up then coming</text><text start="3538.79" dur="3.33">to what is real is third-person stuff</text><text start="3541.04" dur="3.96">because your whole process has been</text><text start="3542.12" dur="4.59">measurements on third-person stuff so</text><text start="3545.0" dur="4.17">there&apos;s an ontological assumption that</text><text start="3546.71" dur="3.48">creates an inappropriate epistemology</text><text start="3549.17" dur="3.15">that then proves the ontological</text><text start="3550.19" dur="3.54">assumption so then they don tor Buddhism</text><text start="3552.32" dur="4.08">did the exact same thing on the opposite</text><text start="3553.73" dur="4.92">side they say that subjectivity is</text><text start="3556.4" dur="6.9">fundamental and objectivity is either an</text><text start="3558.65" dur="6.57">illusion or Maya you know etc or in</text><text start="3563.3" dur="4.05">epiphenomena the structures arising</text><text start="3565.22" dur="4.26">within consciousness and they argue it</text><text start="3567.35" dur="4.05">in a very similar kind of way on the</text><text start="3569.48" dur="4.47">opposite they say well I don&apos;t really I</text><text start="3571.4" dur="4.2">can&apos;t prove that I&apos;m not dreaming or in</text><text start="3573.95" dur="3.12">a hallucination or anything else so my</text><text start="3575.6" dur="3.72">measurements might all be part of a</text><text start="3577.07" dur="4.44">dream and you and the repeatability of</text><text start="3579.32" dur="5.4">it is all part of my dream so I have</text><text start="3581.51" dur="4.92">less epistemic ground on the objective</text><text start="3584.72" dur="3.6">stuff out here than I have on the basis</text><text start="3586.43" dur="3.0">that there is an experience arising that</text><text start="3588.32" dur="2.85">I&apos;m actually experiencing something</text><text start="3589.43" dur="4.62">they&apos;ve Hart said something obviously</text><text start="3591.17" dur="6.24">very similar to this and so what I have</text><text start="3594.05" dur="5.88">the most epistemic grounding on is that</text><text start="3597.41" dur="4.77">experience is occurring but my</text><text start="3599.93" dur="3.57">perception of myself as experience or</text><text start="3602.18" dur="2.82">might be an illusion</text><text start="3603.5" dur="2.97">is a self here but it might be different</text><text start="3605.0" dur="2.97">than I think it is and there&apos;s a world</text><text start="3606.47" dur="4.77">but it might be different than I think</text><text start="3607.97" dur="5.16">it is so there is some self experiencing</text><text start="3611.24" dur="4.38">a world experience or experiencing and</text><text start="3613.13" dur="3.96">experienced that they the experienced</text><text start="3615.62" dur="4.74">and the experienced or might have</text><text start="3617.09" dur="8.13">delusion but the experience is prima</text><text start="3620.36" dur="7.14">facie occurring so what I can what is</text><text start="3625.22" dur="3.63">real is that which can be experienced as</text><text start="3627.5" dur="3.89">opposed to measured and repeated</text><text start="3628.85" dur="4.83">therefore I have an epistemology of</text><text start="3631.39" dur="4.18">inquiry and noticing the nature of</text><text start="3633.68" dur="3.72">experience and running experiments in</text><text start="3635.57" dur="2.76">there of moving attention in certain</text><text start="3637.4" dur="2.58">ways and seeing what happens with</text><text start="3638.33" dur="4.68">experience and so I get a</text><text start="3639.98" dur="5.37">phenomenological epistemology and then</text><text start="3643.01" dur="3.99">that ends up confirming see everything</text><text start="3645.35" dur="3.75">that I noticed is experience and</text><text start="3647.0" dur="4.41">everything that is objective is a riot I</text><text start="3649.1" dur="3.96">can only say even exists because I&apos;m</text><text start="3651.41" dur="2.76">experiencing it if I couldn&apos;t actually</text><text start="3653.06" dur="2.67">experience the measurement the</text><text start="3654.17" dur="2.85">measurement wouldn&apos;t have occurred this</text><text start="3655.73" dur="4.29">is the if the tree falls in the forest</text><text start="3657.02" dur="5.01">and there&apos;s no one there to hear so I</text><text start="3660.02" dur="5.22">would say that they both basically made</text><text start="3662.03" dur="5.79">an oncological that then created an</text><text start="3665.24" dur="4.41">epistemology that then confirmed the</text><text start="3667.82" dur="3.03">oncologic assumption in East is East and</text><text start="3669.65" dur="1.53">West is West and never the twain shall</text><text start="3670.85" dur="4.26">meet</text><text start="3671.18" dur="5.31">and then of course Silicon Valley and</text><text start="3675.11" dur="5.31">whatever we do this very funny thing</text><text start="3676.49" dur="5.64">like take principles of Buddhism to do a</text><text start="3680.42" dur="3.96">mindfulness practice to crush the</text><text start="3682.13" dur="6.36">competition more effectively which is a</text><text start="3684.38" dur="7.65">very funny strange hybrid of kind of the</text><text start="3688.49" dur="6.57">game theoretic versions of both but</text><text start="3692.03" dur="5.88">underneath the experience so ok</text><text start="3695.06" dur="5.34">the vedantist will walk you through a</text><text start="3697.91" dur="4.08">process and say notice the tree now</text><text start="3700.4" dur="3.42">notice that you want the tree you&apos;re the</text><text start="3701.99" dur="3.33">one noticing the tree ok so notice some</text><text start="3703.82" dur="2.79">other objects notice that you aren&apos;t</text><text start="3705.32" dur="2.55">those objects you&apos;re the one noticing</text><text start="3706.61" dur="3.57">the objects now notice your thoughts</text><text start="3707.87" dur="4.41">those thoughts are objects objects of</text><text start="3710.18" dur="3.75">attention so notice that you you can</text><text start="3712.28" dur="3.72">hold an image of the tree in your mind</text><text start="3713.93" dur="4.74">so you aren&apos;t the thoughts you are the</text><text start="3716.0" dur="4.26">witness of the thoughts and you aren&apos;t</text><text start="3718.67" dur="4.62">the emotions the sensations because</text><text start="3720.26" dur="6.3">you&apos;re witnessing them on and on and so</text><text start="3723.29" dur="5.22">all of those are not ultimately what you</text><text start="3726.56" dur="3.84">are they&apos;re changing what is unchanging</text><text start="3728.51" dur="4.35">and all of them is the witness therefore</text><text start="3730.4" dur="4.11">you know the Upanishads say again and</text><text start="3732.86" dur="4.59">again only the self is real only the</text><text start="3734.51" dur="5.3">witness is real right but they start</text><text start="3737.45" dur="5.7">with an observer observing and observed</text><text start="3739.81" dur="5.019">right I had to start with the tree I had</text><text start="3743.15" dur="3.36">to start with a bunch of objects to even</text><text start="3744.829"

dur="3.18">valuable but aren&apos;t extractable and</text><text start="5010.14" dur="3.24">exchangeable so it&apos;s very important to</text><text start="5012.0" dur="3.66">really think through those strategies</text><text start="5013.38" dur="4.47">and say is this going to be an the right</text><text start="5015.66" dur="6.11">way to do it and when you start to</text><text start="5017.85" dur="6.45">monetize one of the parts that is</text><text start="5021.77" dur="4.03">extractable and exchangeable and not all</text><text start="5024.3" dur="2.82">the other ones and you confer a lot of</text><text start="5025.8" dur="3.21">advantage in doing that then obviously</text><text start="5027.12" dur="3.75">you start to bias the entire culture</text><text start="5029.01"

important</text><text start="5045.69" dur="4.98">topic the rationalist community has this</text><text start="5047.7" dur="7.46">you know ongoing debate in certain areas</text><text start="5050.67" dur="6.78">on mistake theory versus conflict theory</text><text start="5055.16" dur="6.28">Michael Vassar turned me on to this</text><text start="5057.45" dur="6.69">thinking and there&apos;s this question of do</text><text start="5061.44" dur="4.14">we do the dumb things because of a</text><text start="5064.14" dur="2.61">mistake theory meaning there was just no</text><text start="5065.58" dur="3.96">way we could have predicted that</text><text start="5066.75" dur="5.25">externality which is too hard oh</text><text start="5069.54" dur="4.8">or conflict theory which was we didn&apos;t</text><text start="5072.0" dur="4.53">really try to predict the externality or</text><text start="5074.34" dur="6.48">the problem or we even wanted to cause</text><text start="5076.53" dur="6.36">it and while both are true one of the</text><text start="5080.82" dur="3.75">things we have to factor is that mistake</text><text start="5082.89" dur="3.66">Theory ends up being a source of</text><text start="5084.57" dur="5.7">plausible deniability for conflict</text><text start="5086.55" dur="5.79">theory so there are heaps of places</text><text start="5090.27" dur="4.23">where we are actually doing something</text><text start="5092.34" dur="4.77">that we know is going to cause harm and</text><text start="5094.5" dur="5.43">whether it&apos;s PNG not fixing their

to do good safety</text><text start="5107.4" dur="3.27">analysis either because that would have</text><text start="5108.75" dur="3.06">been expensive and then after the fact</text><text start="5110.67" dur="4.29">we say there&apos;s no way we could have</text><text start="5111.81" dur="4.65">known so we&apos;ll end up using complexity</text><text start="5114.96" dur="3.45">and mistake theory as a source of</text><text start="5116.46" dur="7.65">plausible deniability for being</text><text start="5118.41" dur="7.38">and so we have to be very careful not to</text><text

well either we do</text><text start="5129.9" dur="3.12">this or don&apos;t do this and if we don&apos;t do</text><text start="5131.7" dur="2.76">it great tragedy</text><text start="5133.02"

to</text><text start="5139.38" dur="3.96">really try to think are there better</text><text start="5140.79" dur="4.2">strategies and probably there are much</text><text start="5143.34" dur="3.06">better strategies but maybe they take</text><text start="5144.99" dur="3.84">more thinking and don&apos;t provide as much</text><text start="5146.4" dur="5.91">immediate capitalisation for

dur="4.71">Apollo projects and then Hatton projects</text><text start="5412.86" dur="4.71">we started having stupidly bloated f-35s</text><text start="5415.679" dur="5.61">it cost 1.5 trillion dollars

dur="6.089">and you can see why China has an emperor</text><text start="5428.639" dur="4.29">that doesn&apos;t have term limits and that</text><text start="5431.099" dur="3.69">basically got rid of the multipolar</text><text start="5432.929" dur="3.63">traps and created a you know kind of</text><text start="5434.789" dur="3.091">top-down control system so they can</text><text start="5436.559"

right like</text><text start="5494.52" dur="4.59">the the government should have a it&apos;s</text><text start="5497.7" dur="4.62">also important understand when you look</text><text start="5499.11" dur="4.83">at post-world War two a lot of the</text><text start="5502.32" dur="3.0">things that we attribute to market were</text><text start="5503.94" dur="2.61">actually because of government

dur="4.68">contracts to HP and IBM were government</text><text start="5511.22" dur="4.0">contracts that put the money and to be</text><text start="5513.33" dur="3.3">able to do deep R&amp;D that

dur="4.02">we get them to not be susceptible to</text><text start="6184.51" dur="3.81">groupthink better how do we get them to</text><text start="6186.91" dur="2.91">have more courage to express what they</text><text start="6188.32" dur="3.09">actually feel and believe in the</text><text start="6189.82" dur="3.87">presence of a group that is trying to</text><text start="6191.41" dur="5.28">groupthink everyone into it and then how</text><text start="6193.69" dur="4.59">do we get higher qualities of civil</text><text start="6196.69" dur="4.05">conversation where the people are</text><text start="6198.28" dur="5.37">oriented to dialectic rather than war</text><text start="6200.74" dur="4.41">and defection I think what we&apos;re seeking</text><text start="6203.65" dur="3.15">is how do we have collective</text><text start="6205.15" dur="4.8">intelligence that is really collective</text><text start="6206.8" dur="5.4">intelligence rather than kind of dumb</text><text start="6209.95" dur="5.67">mobs captured by leaders that want to be</text><text start="6212.2" dur="6.66">leaders I want to be sensitive to time</text><text start="6215.62" dur="5.13">so I want to close on on a last sort of</text><text start="6218.86" dur="3.66">couple questions that like previous ones</text><text start="6220.75" dur="3.45">are gonna seem very different maybe</text><text start="6222.52" dur="4.17">they&apos;re related feel free to take</text><text start="6224.2" dur="4.32">whichever ones appeal to you so one is</text><text start="6226.69" dur="3.69">that I just read this book the sovereign</text><text start="6228.52" dur="4.47">individual recently I have you read in</text><text start="6230.38" dur="4.59">sovereign individual the basic thesis is</text><text start="6232.99" dur="3.99">that we&apos;re going to transform through</text><text start="6234.97" dur="3.72">the 90s and we&apos;ve says we&apos;re gonna</text><text start="6236.98" dur="3.33">transform from citizens of governments</text><text start="6238.69" dur="2.85">you know we exist to serve government&apos;s</text><text start="6240.31" dur="3.0">to customers of governments where</text><text start="6241.54" dur="3.39">governments exist to serve us there any</text><text start="6243.31" dur="3.51">markets for governments the world is</text><text start="6244.93" dur="4.02">going to look you know technology up</text><text start="6246.82" dur="3.42">until now as increasingly central you</text><text start="6248.95" dur="2.73">know become more and more centralized</text><text start="6250.24" dur="3.84">it&apos;s now going to become more and more</text><text start="6251.68" dur="4.38">decentralized might look the world might</text><text start="6254.08" dur="5.04">look like the decentralized city-states</text><text start="6256.06" dur="5.34">you know and people self segmenting I&apos;m</text><text start="6259.12" dur="3.78">curious what you it you know I have you</text><text start="6261.4" dur="2.61">have a sort of if anything comes to mind</text><text start="6262.9" dur="3.75">for you when you think about that future</text><text start="6264.01" dur="4.32">another thing you&apos;ve said in a different</text><text start="6266.65" dur="2.88">episode is you are more excited about</text><text start="6268.33" dur="2.98">sort of the enlightenment of the</text><text start="6269.53" dur="4.93">feminine and if</text><text start="6271.31" dur="5.43">I&apos;m curious if you could talk a little</text><text start="6274.46" dur="4.14">about that and then lastly and this is</text><text start="6276.74" dur="4.86">in closing you said you&apos;ve been reading</text><text start="6278.6" dur="4.23">a lot about you know education or</text><text start="6281.6" dur="3.54">thinking a lot about what the future</text><text start="6282.83" dur="4.8">applications and maybe in closing any</text><text start="6285.14" dur="4.2">any any thoughts thoughts about that as</text><text start="6287.63" dur="5.85">relates to what we&apos;ve been discussing it</text><text start="6289.34" dur="6.12">comes to mind I yeah I mean I&apos;ll just</text><text start="6293.48" dur="5.07">say as a general statement</text><text start="6295.46" dur="4.35">I think central versus decentralizing</text><text start="6298.55" dur="3.03">other one of these kind of</text><text start="6299.81" dur="3.9">oversimplified narrative warfare things</text><text start="6301.58" dur="4.56">where of course there are things that</text><text start="6303.71" dur="3.39">are better when they&apos;re centralized and</text><text start="6306.14" dur="3.51">there are things that are better when</text><text start="6307.1" dur="4.74">they&apos;re decentralized and the best</text><text start="6309.65" dur="4.92">systems involve the relationship between</text><text start="6311.84" dur="5.01">those things and in a nuanced and</text><text start="6314.57" dur="4.17">contextual way because I can show</text><text start="6316.85" dur="3.72">failure modes of D central systems like</text><text start="6318.74" dur="3.12">basically why China is doing better at</text><text start="6320.57" dur="3.57">infrastructure than the u.s. right now</text><text start="6321.86" dur="3.69">actually has to do it&apos;s more centralized</text><text start="6324.14" dur="5.4">control that doesn&apos;t create multipolar</text><text start="6325.55" dur="7.05">traps but then you also see more</text><text start="6329.54" dur="4.71">corruption and control and you know less</text><text start="6332.6" dur="4.5">of certain kinds of innovation</text><text start="6334.25" dur="4.62">incentives with centralization so I</text><text start="6337.1" dur="3.89">think the conversation needs to go</text><text start="6338.87" dur="4.62">deeper than it usually does there</text><text start="6340.99" dur="4.24">similarly if you apply gibberish market</text><text start="6343.49" dur="4.92">theory to government&apos;s and say we&apos;ll</text><text start="6345.23" dur="5.79">become customers and the company serves</text><text start="6348.41" dur="4.32">the customer but we know that the</text><text start="6351.02" dur="3.09">company can actually manufacture demand</text><text start="6352.73" dur="4.23">and capture the customer when it has</text><text start="6354.11" dur="4.62">asymmetric capacities like so basically</text><text start="6356.96" dur="5.88">I would say that in the same thing with</text><text start="6358.73" dur="9.81">masculine-feminine I think most of like</text><text start="6362.84" dur="10.55">we can see the left having a feminism</text><text start="6368.54" dur="7.32">that is moved to kind of LGBTQ trans</text><text start="6373.39" dur="3.46">ideology and in a racial ideology that</text><text start="6375.86" dur="4.35">is kind of represented in</text><text start="6376.85" dur="6.09">intersectionality and then we can see a</text><text start="6380.21" dur="4.5">very strong backlash to that and alt</text><text start="6382.94" dur="4.11">right kind of thinking and so there&apos;s</text><text start="6384.71" dur="5.82">like massively charged stuff here and I</text><text start="6387.05" dur="7.32">think the general the underlying ideas</text><text start="6390.53" dur="5.91">of what is true and what is good or we</text><text start="6394.37" dur="4.29">need to go much deeper on I think the</text><text start="6396.44" dur="3.96">Kahn I think the conversation is usually</text><text start="6398.66" dur="4.26">framed in a way where I&apos;m rejecting the</text><text start="6400.4" dur="4.77">frames and would want to reconstruct the</text><text start="6402.92" dur="5.009">frames so that&apos;s why</text><text start="6405.17" dur="4.259">longer conversations totally perfect</text><text start="6407.929" dur="3.631">that&apos;s it perfect note to close on</text><text start="6409.429" dur="3.901">dinner thank you so much for coming up</text><text start="6411.56" dur="3.57">the podcast for listeners who
