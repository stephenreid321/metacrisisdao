podcast</text><text start="3.24" dur="4.71">this week&apos;s guest is Daniel schmuck dan</text><text start="5.819" dur="4.081">burger co-founder and director of</text><text start="7.95" dur="4.88">research and development at neuro hacker</text><text start="9.9" dur="6.99">collective a company that specializes in</text><text start="12.83" dur="6.55">developing things to improve cognitive</text><text start="16.89" dur="4.95">function they&apos;re their only product out</text><text start="19.38" dur="7.559">now is a nootropic called</text><text start="21.84" dur="8.37">qualia which is basically to supercharge</text><text start="26.939" dur="5.73">your brain and so when I went into this</text><text start="30.21" dur="5.52">conversation I had intended to talk all</text><text start="32.669" dur="5.611">about nootropics and ways to you know</text><text start="35.73" dur="4.649">what are some some legal medicines that</text><text start="38.28" dur="3.869">people can take to improve their their</text><text start="40.379" dur="5.371">brain function but what we actually</text><text start="42.149" dur="5.811">ended up talking about was first off how</text><text start="45.75" dur="5.699">- what would are basically the</text><text start="47.96" dur="7.599">prerequisites for someone to be meeting</text><text start="51.449" dur="7.02">before using these types of supplements</text><text start="55.559" dur="5.011">so we talked about adrenal fatigue and</text><text start="58.469" dur="4.651">how to know if you&apos;re drinking too much</text><text start="60.57" dur="5.549">caffeine we talked about sleep a little</text><text start="63.12" dur="5.31">bit about nutrition because the basic</text><text start="66.119" dur="5.101">premise is that if you don&apos;t have some</text><text start="68.43" dur="5.939">of these basic or all of these basics</text><text start="71.22" dur="5.88">down pat then it&apos;s like putting a</text><text start="74.369" dur="5.43">turbocharger and I&apos;m using his wording</text><text start="77.1" dur="7.08">here a turbocharger in a car without an</text><text start="79.799" dur="7.081">engine so putting a turbocharger in a</text><text start="84.18" dur="4.229">car without an engine what means that</text><text start="86.88" dur="3.9">the car will go nowhere but if you have</text><text start="88.409" dur="4.441">an engine without a turbocharger then</text><text start="90.78" dur="4.14">your car will still move so we talked</text><text start="92.85" dur="4.35">about the engine portion of the equation</text><text start="94.92" dur="5.339">on this one and then we&apos;re going to do a</text><text start="97.2" dur="5.34">follow-up soon Daniel is an incredibly</text><text start="100.259" dur="4.591">intelligent guy and I learned a ton from</text><text start="102.54" dur="5.43">this one and I know you will too enjoy</text><text start="104.85" dur="5.879">the show what&apos;s up everyone this is Mike</text><text start="107.97" dur="5.88">cashew I&apos;m here with Daniel &apos;shmock</text><text start="110.729" dur="5.551">timber ger co-founder and director of Rd</text><text start="113.85" dur="4.769">at neuro hacker collectives Daniel I</text><text start="116.28" dur="4.14">know you&apos;re an incredibly busy guy thank</text><text start="118.619" dur="4.14">you so much for making some time to do</text><text start="120.42" dur="4.35">this with me man I&apos;m very excited happy</text><text start="122.759" dur="5.161">to be here with you this is fun awesome</text><text start="124.77" dur="4.829">so we you know before before the show</text><text start="127.92" dur="5.459">started just now we were talking about</text><text start="129.599" dur="7.14">my personal experience with cats</text><text start="133.379" dur="5.851">and the fact that I&apos;ve been taking way</text><text start="136.739" dur="4.89">too much caffeine and I got off</text><text start="139.23" dur="4.86">completely for a couple weeks ago and as</text><text start="141.629" dur="4.92">we got into conversation about it it</text><text start="144.09" dur="3.69">sounds like I may need to take quite a</text><text start="146.549" dur="3.181">bit more time off</text><text start="147.78" dur="3.989">and so I thought it might be an</text><text start="149.73" dur="4.5">interesting place to start because a lot</text><text start="151.769" dur="4.351">of my listeners I know are caffeine</text><text start="154.23" dur="4.86">addicts right there&apos;s there&apos;s even a</text><text start="156.12" dur="4.649">company in the CrossFit space called and</text><text start="159.09" dur="4.14">weightlifting space called caffeine and</text><text start="160.769" dur="5.461">kilos and it&apos;s very you know</text><text start="163.23" dur="5.97">romanticized and people just love their</text><text start="166.23" dur="5.61">coffee and so I think this this would be</text><text start="169.2" dur="4.619">a really useful conversation for us to</text><text start="171.84" dur="4.739">kind of start out with for people to</text><text start="173.819" dur="4.021">know if you know they if they might need</text><text start="176.579" dur="5.181">to do the same thing that I&apos;m about to</text><text start="177.84" dur="7.549">do so what is what are the signs that</text><text start="181.76" dur="8.819">someone is taking too much caffeine</text><text start="185.389" dur="7.831">mm-hmm so step back a little bit and</text><text start="190.579" dur="6.16">recognize that the caffeine is a</text><text start="193.22" dur="5.5">psychoactive chemical compound right we</text><text start="196.739" dur="5.131">can say it&apos;s a psychoactive drug and</text><text start="198.72" dur="6.629">it&apos;s one of humanity&apos;s favorite ones up</text><text start="201.87" dur="6.949">there with alcohol and cannabis etc for</text><text start="205.349" dur="8.97">a very long time from tea and coffee and</text><text start="208.819" dur="8.88">you know many sources and I think it&apos;s a</text><text start="214.319" dur="6.84">beautiful molecule and can actually have</text><text start="217.699" dur="5.5">life extension and life enhancing</text><text start="221.159" dur="3.66">properties used rightly and like any</text><text start="223.199" dur="3.271">tool and especially the more powerful</text><text start="224.819" dur="8.16">tool can also have life damaging</text><text start="226.47" dur="8.849">properties used improperly and it&apos;s</text><text start="232.979" dur="4.801">pretty easy to misuse caffeine the</text><text start="235.319" dur="4.801">easiest way to misuse caffeine is to use</text><text start="237.78" dur="7.019">it to deal with tiredness from not</text><text start="240.12" dur="6.39">resting enough so if someone is not</text><text start="244.799" dur="6.09">sleeping enough or they&apos;re not sleeping</text><text start="246.51" dur="6.479">well and the way they notice that is</text><text start="250.889" dur="4.05">that they&apos;re either tired in the morning</text><text start="252.989" dur="3.451">when they wake up say to in long they</text><text start="254.939" dur="4.501">don&apos;t feel fully rested or they get</text><text start="256.44" dur="6.32">tired in the afternoon their answer to</text><text start="259.44" dur="5.969">it rather than to rest is to stimulate</text><text start="262.76" dur="4.02">that&apos;s how adrenal fatigue and burnout</text><text start="265.409" dur="5.241">happens</text><text start="266.78" dur="6.15">and so we kind of paradoxically caffeine</text><text start="270.65" dur="6.29">is best used when people are already</text><text start="272.93" dur="7.65">energized and they are then using it for</text><text start="276.94" dur="5.62">enhancement of metabolic activity in an</text><text start="280.58" dur="6.84">already healthy system that can handle</text><text start="282.56" dur="8.28">the stimulus as opposed to in a under</text><text start="287.42" dur="5.1">rested under you know operating system</text><text start="290.84" dur="3.39">that can&apos;t really handle the stimulus</text><text start="292.52" dur="3.84">without damage so that&apos;s the biggest</text><text start="294.23" dur="5.7">thing and there are so many people who</text><text start="296.36" dur="6.26">use caffeine as a like as if it is a</text><text start="299.93" dur="5.85">replacement for adequate or good sleep</text><text start="302.62" dur="5.92">or good rest in other ways and that&apos;s</text><text start="305.78" dur="3.389">that is a very fast way to make it very</text><text start="308.54" dur="3.69">bad for you</text><text start="309.169" dur="5.821">right so what you&apos;re kind of suggesting</text><text start="312.23" dur="5.64">it sounds like is that one of the</text><text start="314.99" dur="5.25">biggest benefits of caffeine is more to</text><text start="317.87" dur="3.81">do with the metabolism rather than to do</text><text start="320.24" dur="4.14">with boosting your energy and</text><text start="321.68" dur="6.11">stimulating you in that sort of way is</text><text start="324.38" dur="6.03">that is that what I&apos;m hearing when even</text><text start="327.79" dur="3.879">regarding the kind of stimulant</text><text start="330.41" dur="3.54">properties the central nervous system</text><text start="331.669" dur="4.201">stimulant properties the way it inhibits</text><text start="333.95" dur="4.83">adenosine the way that it has a</text><text start="335.87" dur="5.85">dopaminergic effect those still work</text><text start="338.78" dur="5.16">much better on a well-rested system that</text><text start="341.72" dur="3.87">can handle being stimulated without</text><text start="343.94" dur="3.84">being damaged right because if a system</text><text start="345.59" dur="4.26">is getting tired it means the body is</text><text start="347.78" dur="3.57">endogenously down regulating rather than</text><text start="349.85" dur="3.87">up regulating because it wants to be an</text><text start="351.35" dur="5.28">arrest and repair point place rather</text><text start="353.72" dur="5.58">than in a you know fully on and utilized</text><text start="356.63" dur="4.38">place so when the body needs to be an</text><text start="359.3" dur="4.05">arrest and repair place and we stimulate</text><text start="361.01" dur="5.33">it to be in a non place that is at the</text><text start="363.35" dur="6.48">cost of the integrity of the system</text><text start="366.34" dur="7.6">gotcha so that&apos;s the first big thing</text><text start="369.83" dur="6.33">with regard to caffeine is it&apos;s really</text><text start="373.94" dur="4.59">critical that caffeine is not being used</text><text start="376.16" dur="4.86">because it&apos;s needed it&apos;s being used when</text><text start="378.53" dur="5.37">it&apos;s not needed as an enhancement to the</text><text start="381.02" dur="4.34">system gods raden that&apos;s not just</text><text start="383.9" dur="4.32">caffeine that&apos;s if someone&apos;s using</text><text start="385.36" dur="6.19">nicotine so using theobromine if they&apos;re</text><text start="388.22" dur="6.93">using any kind of stimulant</text><text start="391.55" dur="7.619">it&apos;s important to eat that in mind so</text><text start="395.15" dur="4.96">before we go into how to identify if</text><text start="399.169" dur="2.951">someone is you know</text><text start="400.11" dur="4.59">taking too much of caffeine or any</text><text start="402.12" dur="4.98">stimulant why is it even important like</text><text start="404.7" dur="6.83">you know what what are the the dangers</text><text start="407.1" dur="4.43">to someone&apos;s performance and even health</text><text start="412.19" dur="7.93">yeah so many things if if you look at a</text><text start="416.82" dur="5.19">dynasty inhibition if and to adenosine</text><text start="420.12" dur="4.11">is a neuro chemical that helps bring on</text><text start="422.01" dur="5.4">the sleep impulse and so caffeine</text><text start="424.23" dur="4.77">inhibits that molecule if you&apos;re trying</text><text start="427.41" dur="3.96">to inhibit it when it&apos;s coming on strong</text><text start="429.0" dur="4.98">because it needs to come on then you&apos;ll</text><text start="431.37" dur="4.71">end up getting imbalances in your</text><text start="433.98" dur="3.81">adenosine cycle and in your circadian</text><text start="436.08" dur="3.33">cycles which will look like not getting</text><text start="437.79" dur="3.75">as good a quality sleep in not getting</text><text start="439.41" dur="4.08">it&apos;s not repaired during your sleep it</text><text start="441.54" dur="3.45">can then look like resistance to</text><text start="443.49" dur="5.13">adenosine inhibition and so you&apos;ll</text><text start="444.99" dur="6.18">notice that by having less of an effect</text><text start="448.62" dur="4.77">from coffee where you can take coffee or</text><text start="451.17" dur="4.26">any source of caffeine and still fall</text><text start="453.39" dur="4.83">asleep afterwards that means that your</text><text start="455.43" dur="5.99">ability to inhibit the adenosine cycle</text><text start="458.22" dur="7.59">is you know it&apos;s bitten down regulated</text><text start="461.42" dur="8.44">and then specifically adrenal fatigue</text><text start="465.81" dur="6.9">and adrenal burnout happens largely when</text><text start="469.86" dur="4.5">you continue to stress a system that has</text><text start="472.71" dur="3.54">been stressed and now needs to repair</text><text start="474.36" dur="4.95">before we give it adequate repair and</text><text start="476.25" dur="5.88">when you understand all of the roles of</text><text start="479.31" dur="4.83">the renal glands have in converting</text><text start="482.13" dur="4.05">neurologic impulse to endocrine impulse</text><text start="484.14" dur="8.91">you know it&apos;s involved in fat metabolism</text><text start="486.18" dur="9.27">and muscle repair and lean body muscle</text><text start="493.05" dur="4.65">mass it&apos;s involved in everything from</text><text start="495.45" dur="3.93">genetic transcription to the regulation</text><text start="497.7" dur="5.33">of the rest of the endocrine system to</text><text start="499.38" dur="6.24">immune function to bone density and so</text><text start="503.03" dur="4.57">over stimulating and over taxing your</text><text start="505.62" dur="4.95">adrenal system is definitely not</text><text start="507.6" dur="5.55">something somebody wants to do got it so</text><text start="510.57" dur="4.35">how how what are some signs were some</text><text start="513.15" dur="3.27">other signs that people can look for</text><text start="514.92" dur="6.6">where some tests they can give</text><text start="516.42" dur="7.77">themselves yeah one of the common ones</text><text start="521.52" dur="5.04">is that the stimulating effect that</text><text start="524.19" dur="4.62">caffeine had early in someone&apos;s use it</text><text start="526.56" dur="5.49">doesn&apos;t have anymore and that&apos;s the sign</text><text start="528.81" dur="5.29">of desensitization down regulation so</text><text start="532.05" dur="4.8">they used to</text><text start="534.1" dur="5.76">eight ounces of coffee and feel</text><text start="536.85" dur="6.4">increased wakefulness now they have to</text><text start="539.86" dur="7.62">drink more coffee to still notice a</text><text start="543.25" dur="5.43">smaller effect if you used to not be</text><text start="547.48" dur="2.64">able to fall asleep on coffee and now</text><text start="548.68" dur="3.95">you can fall asleep on it if you need</text><text start="550.12" dur="5.1">more than you used to need if you are</text><text start="552.63" dur="4.389">having a sense of needing it or needing</text><text start="555.22" dur="5.16">it more times in the course of a day</text><text start="557.019" dur="5.49">later into the day if you&apos;re noticing</text><text start="560.38" dur="5.189">the effects less these are all signs of</text><text start="562.509" dur="5.52">desensitization down-regulation so one</text><text start="565.569" dur="6.901">of the key things with pretty much</text><text start="568.029" dur="6.331">anything is in terms of anything that</text><text start="572.47" dur="6.539">we&apos;re taking in other than like water</text><text start="574.36" dur="6.839">and air is cycling and so just like with</text><text start="579.009" dur="4.231">workouts you need to have cycles between</text><text start="581.199" dur="3.901">stressing the muscles and then letting</text><text start="583.24" dur="3.42">them rest and repair and you want to</text><text start="585.1" dur="2.609">kind of cycle between different workouts</text><text start="586.66" dur="3.69">because if you keep doing the same</text><text start="587.709" dur="4.711">workout you start to desensitize to that</text><text start="590.35" dur="3.539">particular stimulus and you will get</text><text start="592.42" dur="5.339">less from it than if you cycle it -</text><text start="593.889" dur="5.64">another way of stressing muscle and if</text><text start="597.759" dur="3.18">you think of it from a evolutionary</text><text start="599.529" dur="2.49">point of view in terms of chemistry</text><text start="600.939" dur="2.791">coming into the body</text><text start="602.019" dur="3.901">pretty much other than water there was</text><text start="603.73" dur="5.31">no food source that was always available</text><text start="605.92" dur="5.49">all year round and so our body was</text><text start="609.04" dur="4.68">consistently getting different kinds of</text><text start="611.41" dur="5.33">chemical input and then regulating in a</text><text start="613.72" dur="6.66">hunter-gatherer kind of environment so</text><text start="616.74" dur="5.92">rotating our foods and rotating our</text><text start="620.38" dur="3.509">supplements and etc is valuable and</text><text start="622.66" dur="2.64">different ones need to rotate on</text><text start="623.889" dur="6.091">different cycles there are some things</text><text start="625.3" dur="6.63">that down regulate quickly like say some</text><text start="629.98" dur="4.589">this isn&apos;t a supplement but you know</text><text start="631.93" dur="7.139">from a from a kind of neuro hacking</text><text start="634.569" dur="6.75">point of view if someone does MDMA they</text><text start="639.069" dur="5.311">don&apos;t have to do that many times before</text><text start="641.319" dur="5.161">their system will start to acclimate to</text><text start="644.38" dur="4.379">it down regulate and then have pretty</text><text start="646.48" dur="5.669">bad symptomology if they stop doing in</text><text start="648.759" dur="5.64">so someone really shouldn&apos;t do that more</text><text start="652.149" dur="4.05">than and it&apos;s going to depend on their</text><text start="654.399" dur="2.851">individual physiology some people might</text><text start="656.199" dur="2.971">be able do it a couple times a month</text><text start="657.25" dur="4.709">some people only once every several</text><text start="659.17" dur="6.09">months so the cycle there has to be</text><text start="661.959" dur="5.851">relatively little on lots of off whereas</text><text start="665.26" dur="4.98">say someone</text><text start="667.81" dur="4.65">is taking resistant starch as a</text><text start="670.24" dur="3.87">prebiotic they can take that most of the</text><text start="672.46" dur="3.84">time but pretty much anything should be</text><text start="674.11" dur="5.25">cycled off now and again with regard to</text><text start="676.3" dur="5.85">caffeine it&apos;s it&apos;s actually a molecule</text><text start="679.36" dur="4.919">that people habituate to and then get a</text><text start="682.15" dur="5.01">low level of addiction or dependence</text><text start="684.279" dur="4.591">quite quickly which is the the signal of</text><text start="687.16" dur="6.48">that is getting headaches when you come</text><text start="688.87" dur="7.17">off of it and so letting people stay in</text><text start="693.64" dur="4.41">an on cycle longer so that they&apos;re not</text><text start="696.04" dur="4.26">dealing would say you know headaches</text><text start="698.05" dur="5.01">every week is a cycling off you know on</text><text start="700.3" dur="4.38">the weekend the general recommendation I</text><text start="703.06" dur="3.99">get to most people is if they want to</text><text start="704.68" dur="4.62">use caffeine regularly as opposed to</text><text start="707.05" dur="3.72">just now and again which i think is fine</text><text start="709.3" dur="5.28">to do if you&apos;re sleeping enough and not</text><text start="710.77" dur="6.42">overusing it is give or take one week</text><text start="714.58" dur="6.72">every quarter you come off of it and the</text><text start="717.19" dur="5.839">first couple days suck you can take a</text><text

dur="5.7">neuro hacking the company you own is</text><text start="1071.62" dur="5.7">called neuro hacker collective and I</text><text start="1074.44" dur="5.31">think everyone out there has heard

dur="5.671">myths surrounding the word so first off</text><text start="1085.33" dur="7.74">can you just describe briefly what neuro</text><text start="1088.48" dur="7.14">hacking is so we&apos;ll describe the way</text><text start="1093.07" dur="6.95">that we think of it and kind of how we</text><text start="1095.62" dur="4.4">define it so neural hacking for us is</text><text start="1101.58"

dur="4.74">effects and down regulation of something</text><text start="1170.14" dur="4.5">meaningful long-term but how do we do it</text><text start="1172.15" dur="4.08">in a way that is sustainable</text><text start="1174.64" dur="4.11">regenerative and we&apos;re actually more</text><text start="1176.23" dur="5.1">focused on up regulating regulatory</text><text start="1178.75"

dur="6.63">little bit further sure so let&apos;s say</text><text start="1193.33" dur="4.86">we&apos;re going to talk about stimulants</text><text start="1195.13" dur="5.76">again stimulants are tools of neural</text><text start="1198.19" dur="4.229">hacking but most of them most of them</text><text start="1200.89" dur="3.359">don&apos;t fit it to what</text><text start="1202.419" dur="5.25">would consider good neural hacking tools</text><text start="1204.249" dur="6.39">so let&apos;s say we take adderall there are</text><text start="1207.669" dur="4.47">outside of its medical application there</text><text start="1210.639" dur="5.22">are many people who take adderall or</text><text start="1212.139" dur="7.081">other kinds of smart drugs stimulants to</text><text start="1215.859"

because they&apos;re</text><text start="1222.879" dur="5.341">having a hard time focusing adequately</text><text start="1224.529" dur="5.97">and this is a helping them so adderall</text><text start="1228.22" dur="4.919">is primarily working on your dopamine</text><text start="1230.499" dur="4.68">system it&apos;s a presynaptic dopamine</text><text start="1233.139" dur="4.29">agonist so

start="1622.519" dur="5.9">minimum not damaging it love it I&apos;ve got</text><text start="1626.24" dur="5.789">a two-part question for you next so</text><text start="1628.419" dur="6.64">first off before before we get deeper</text><text start="1632.029" dur="5.25">into optimizing brain function what are</text><text start="1635.059" dur="4.08">what are some of the prerequisites that</text><text start="1637.279" dur="5.22">people should be doing consistently</text><text start="1639.139" dur="7.561">before considering some of these neuro</text><text start="1642.499" dur="7.471">hacking supplementation these ways of</text><text start="1646.7" dur="6.299">supplementing and if they are not</text><text start="1649.97" dur="5.99">meeting those prerequisites are things</text><text start="1652.999" dur="4.89">like nootropics neuro hacking</text><text start="1655.96" dur="6.48">supplementation it are they even</text><text start="1657.889" dur="4.551">beneficial mm-hmm</text><text start="1663.519" dur="7.211">and so with those prerequisites I&apos;m</text><text start="1667.49" dur="6.779">talking I&apos;m talking nutrition and</text><text start="1670.73" dur="5.159">lifestyle mainly sure it&apos;s a nuanced</text><text start="1674.269" dur="5.221">question so I&apos;m going to answer it a</text><text start="1675.889" dur="6.091">couple ways this the first part is I</text><text start="1679.49" dur="3.99">would say to the degree that someone can</text><text start="1681.98" dur="5.189">have the foundational aspects of</text><text start="1683.48" dur="5.699">lifestyle be with it it&apos;s not first and</text><text start="1687.169" dur="4.98">then any kind of enhancement be what</text><text start="1689.179" dur="6.931">they built off that foundation that&apos;s a</text><text start="1692.149" dur="6.811">good rule of thumb and so if someone for</text><text start="1696.11" dur="5.61">instance isn&apos;t sleeping well either they</text><text start="1698.96" dur="5.699">aren&apos;t getting dropping into deep Delta</text><text start="1701.72" dur="3.419">sleep or they aren&apos;t getting enough</text><text start="1704.659" dur="6.541">sleep</text><text start="1705.139" dur="9.691">then a the starts taking immune support</text><text start="1711.2" dur="6.03">of herbs well most of the immune repair</text><text start="1714.83" dur="3.99">only happens at night when sleeping and</text><text start="1717.23" dur="3.63">sharing Delta sleep if you&apos;re not</text><text start="1718.82" dur="4.17">getting enough Delta sleep those are</text><text start="1720.86" dur="3.509">just not going to do that much if you&apos;re</text><text start="1722.99" dur="5.309">taking things that are going to support</text><text start="1724.369" dur="7.5">a tissue synthesis most of the tissue</text><text start="1728.299" dur="4.86">repair happens during Delta sleep if</text><text start="1731.869" dur="4.111">you&apos;re taking the topics that are going</text><text start="1733.159" dur="4.921">to support things like memory memory</text><text start="1735.98" dur="2.61">consolidation happens during Delta sleep</text><text start="1738.08" dur="2.28">and</text><text start="1738.59" dur="5.459">some aspects happen during SATA sleep</text><text start="1740.36" dur="5.4">and so you&apos;re going to get a kind of</text><text start="1744.049" dur="2.76">tiny fraction of anything that you&apos;re</text><text start="1745.76" dur="2.58">taking that&apos;s going to help your</text><text start="1746.809" dur="3.381">regenerative capacity if you&apos;re not</text><text start="1748.34" dur="4.829">doing the foundational thing that is</text><text start="1750.19" dur="5.44">where regeneration occurs we can also</text><text start="1753.169" dur="3.721">look at diet and say alright say I&apos;m</text><text start="1755.63" dur="4.26">going to take some supplements and I</text><text start="1756.89" dur="7.019">take even if I take a handful of pills a</text><text start="1759.89" dur="6.57">day I&apos;m still talking about a relatively</text><text start="1763.909" dur="3.87">tiny amount of grams in comparison to</text><text start="1766.46" dur="4.98">the total amount of food I eat per day</text><text start="1767.779" dur="7.65">and all of that food is chemistry that</text><text start="1771.44" dur="6.479">is not just macros that are competing my</text><text start="1775.429" dur="4.441">body fat muscle composition but they are</text><text start="1777.919" dur="3.451">all of the microbes that are affecting</text><text start="1779.87" dur="2.88">what my brain is made out of what my</text><text start="1781.37" dur="3.08">hormones are made out of what all my</text><text start="1782.75" dur="5.76">tissues are made out of themselves and</text><text start="1784.45" dur="8.589">so all of that food is either medicine</text><text start="1788.51" dur="7.649">or toxicity or somewhere on that</text><text start="1793.039" dur="5.61">spectrum and so if somebody is taking in</text><text start="1796.159" dur="5.25">food that is not providing adequate</text><text start="1798.649" dur="5.341">nutrition and especially if it&apos;s</text><text start="1801.409" dur="5.791">providing toxicity and then they&apos;re</text><text start="1803.99" dur="4.89">going to try and just override that by</text><text start="1807.2" dur="2.969">taking supplements it&apos;s kind of like</text><text start="1808.88" dur="3.63">taking caffeine instead of sleeping</text><text start="1810.169" dur="4.291">right it&apos;s just so the reason that the</text><text start="1812.51" dur="6.779">word supplement is used as it means in</text><text start="1814.46" dur="7.949">addition to right so if you think about</text><text start="1819.289" dur="4.831">maybe I think most people in your</text><text start="1822.409" dur="4.051">podcast will pray be familiar with this</text><text start="1824.12" dur="5.01">if you think about the way that like a</text><text start="1826.46" dur="5.04">turbocharger or supercharger added to an</text><text start="1829.13" dur="4.76">engine moves more oxygen through the</text><text start="1831.5" dur="4.289">engine so you can get more combustion a</text><text start="1833.89" dur="4.57">turbocharger without an engine doesn&apos;t</text><text

you think of the engine</text><text start="1843.5" dur="5.01">as lifestyle and you think about all the</text><text start="1846.59" dur="3.959">kind of hacking as like adding a badass</text><text start="1848.51" dur="4.019">turbocharger there&apos;s no question it can</text><text start="1850.549" dur="3.75">make you go a lot faster but it has to</text><text start="1852.529" dur="5.671">be on

your</text><text start="2109.33" dur="4.02">tongue but it takes a minute to find it</text><text start="2110.92" dur="5.16">that&apos;s a pretty classic sign of sleep</text><text start="2113.35" dur="6.45">debt and that shouldn&apos;t be that&apos;s not</text><text start="2116.08" dur="5.34">just like aging or being human or having</text><text start="2119.8" dur="3.92">a high IQ that&apos;s actually a sign that</text><text start="2121.42" dur="4.98">your brain is not functioning that well</text><text start="2123.72" dur="5.8">and it can be from different reasons but</text><text start="2126.4" dur="5.31">it&apos;s most commonly asleep that if you</text><text start="2129.52" dur="5.61">just completely [ __ ] forgot where you</text><text start="2131.71" dur="5.28">parked or where you put your keys or</text><text start="2135.13" dur="3.87">your phone or what you were doing last</text><text start="2136.99" dur="2.93">or you know something like that</text><text

not normal</text><text start="2144.569" dur="4.711">that&apos;s actually a sign of dysfunction</text><text start="2146.9" dur="4.209">and the most common reason for it is</text><text start="2149.28" dur="5.13">sleep now it can be for other reasons it</text><text start="2151.109" dur="5.341">can be new nutrition deficiency it can</text><text start="2154.41" dur="5.61">be stress overload it can be exposure to</text><text start="2156.45" dur="5.099">toxins neurotoxins mold etc but sleeps</text><text start="2160.02" dur="4.319">the most common one and sleep helps with</text><text start="2161.549" dur="3.871">all those other things so one of the</text><text start="2164.339" dur="3.601">interesting things though is that as</text><text start="2165.42" dur="5.159">someone is moving into sleep debt at</text><text start="2167.94" dur="3.99">first they notice it and they go oh I&apos;m</text><text start="2170.579" dur="2.911">a little bit tired if they had been</text><text start="2171.93" dur="4.649">sleeping well and then they&apos;re like oh</text><text start="2173.49" dur="5.579">I&apos;m getting more tired but as someone</text><text start="2176.579" dur="4.171">gets deeper into sleep debt they stop</text><text start="2179.069" dur="4.861">recognizing that they&apos;re getting deeper</text><text start="2180.75" dur="5.16">into sleep debt and so there is actually</text><text start="2183.93" dur="5.1">a mismatch between someone&apos;s own</text><text start="2185.91" dur="5.22">self-assessment of how much sleep debt</text><text start="2189.03" dur="4.11">is there and how much like that&apos;s</text><text start="2191.13" dur="3.63">actually there it&apos;s very much like drunk</text><text start="2193.14" dur="3.24">people who can&apos;t recognize how drunk</text><text start="2194.76" dur="4.89">they are because their brain is Mis</text><text start="2196.38" dur="5.699">assessing it the tired brain is Mis</text><text start="2199.65" dur="4.35">assessing this also from just an</text><text start="2202.079" dur="4.04">evolutionary adaptation right like think</text><text start="2204.0" dur="4.2">about mothers who have an infant baby</text><text start="2206.119" dur="3.94">they&apos;re just not going to get enough</text><text start="2208.2" dur="3.75">sleep for a while right unless unless</text><text start="2210.059" dur="4.05">they just have one of those magical</text><text start="2211.95" dur="3.75">babies that sleeps all night long and</text><text start="2214.109" dur="3.901">they have a husband that does a lot</text><text start="2215.7" dur="3.389">maybe a nanny in a community they&apos;re</text><text start="2218.01" dur="3.839">going to go through a period of sleep</text><text start="2219.089" dur="4.411">that and so to be aware of how much they</text><text start="2221.849" dur="3.301">were in sleep that would just suck so</text><text start="2223.5" dur="3.359">they just kind of be there&apos;s this</text><text start="2225.15" dur="4.89">evolutionary adaptation to be less aware</text><text start="2226.859" dur="5.76">of it but the problem of course is that</text><text start="2230.04" dur="5.97">we can then exploit that lack of</text><text start="2232.619" dur="5.641">awareness to keep going and so most</text><text start="2236.01" dur="4.92">people will have a situation where</text><text start="2238.26" dur="4.38">they&apos;re like say only operating at</text><text start="2240.93" dur="3.179">seventy percent of capacity but they</text><text start="2242.64" dur="3.39">only but they think they&apos;re operating at</text><text start="2244.109" dur="3.75">ninety percent of capacity and that miss</text><text start="2246.03" dur="6.029">assessment is actually the court with</text><text start="2247.859" dur="5.97">the cause of a lot of problems so when</text><text start="2252.059" dur="3.721">you were asking about foundations I</text><text start="2253.829" dur="7.77">really do put sleep in its own category</text><text start="2255.78" dur="8.1">and then next I&apos;m going to put nutrition</text><text start="2261.599" dur="5.911">and what people are taking in their</text><text start="2263.88" dur="5.34">mouth I&apos;m going to put movement I want</text><text start="2267.51" dur="5.099">you know exercise will be a subset of</text><text start="2269.22" dur="3.96">that and I&apos;ll put the relationship to</text><text start="2272.609" dur="2.311">stress</text><text start="2273.18" dur="3.51">which is going to have to do with the</text><text start="2274.92" dur="3.3">relationships in their life the nature</text><text start="2276.69" dur="3.389">of their work the way they create</text><text start="2278.22" dur="4.02">meaning how they&apos;ve processed old trauma</text><text start="2280.079" dur="3.96">whether they give themselves time to</text><text start="2282.24" dur="4.68">meditate journal etc do things to</text><text start="2284.039" dur="5.52">process it now then we can put other</text><text start="2286.92" dur="4.379">categories like someone&apos;s home</text><text start="2289.559" dur="3.72">environment that&apos;s kind of a big deal if</text><text start="2291.299" dur="3.211">they live in a house that say has mold</text><text start="2293.279" dur="3.421">in it or they live in an environment</text><text start="2294.51" dur="3.809">that&apos;s actually dangerous so they&apos;re</text><text start="2296.7" dur="3.57">stressed out all the time or dealing</text><text start="2298.319" dur="4.341">with physical stressors or they&apos;re</text><text start="2300.27" dur="4.5">around people who are either</text><text start="2302.66" dur="3.369">particularly negative or have lifestyle</text><text start="2304.77" dur="3.839">habits that influence them in the wrong</text><text start="2306.029" dur="5.01">direction so environment people and</text><text start="2308.609" dur="4.891">physical environment can really kind of</text><text start="2311.039" dur="4.5">be are you another foundational category</text><text start="2313.5" dur="3.72">tell you what let&apos;s let&apos;s stop it right</text><text start="2315.539" dur="3.75">there I want to pull on a couple of</text><text start="2317.22" dur="4.879">those categories and yeah and I&apos;m</text><text start="2319.289" dur="5.901">realizing that we could have a four-hour</text><text start="2322.099" dur="5.081">conversation and not not get through</text><text start="2325.19" dur="3.369">everything I wanted to get through so</text><text start="2327.18" dur="2.909">I&apos;m just going to I&apos;m just going to go</text><text start="2328.559" dur="5.52">down a couple of these different avenues</text><text start="2330.089" dur="6.391">first off the the that miss assessment</text><text start="2334.079" dur="3.571">is absolutely fascinating because one of</text><text start="2336.48" dur="3.629">the things I was going to bring up is</text><text start="2337.65" dur="4.949">that so many people they think they&apos;re</text><text start="2340.109" dur="5.791">operating at a hundred percent and when</text><text start="2342.599" dur="5.22">you you know when you suggest a couple</text><text start="2345.9" dur="6.51">things whether it be you know nutrition</text><text start="2347.819" dur="6.03">or sleep advice they they don&apos;t really</text><text start="2352.41" dur="3.23">see the point because they feel like</text><text start="2353.849" dur="5.911">they are operating at a hundred percent</text><text start="2355.64" dur="6.52">um I&apos;m curious what are are there any</text><text start="2359.76" dur="5.849">like kind of biggest bang for your buck</text><text start="2362.16" dur="9.0">type interventions or changes that you</text><text start="2365.609" dur="8.25">think most or all people should make all</text><text start="2371.16" dur="5.399">is obviously not not going to work but</text><text start="2373.859" dur="8.541">most people are deficient in and need to</text><text start="2376.559" dur="5.841">change in their diet and their diet yes</text><text start="2386.0" dur="4.18">this is a lot of things and it is there</text><text start="2388.95" dur="2.82">are some things that are true across the</text><text start="2390.18" dur="2.58">board and there&apos;s a lot of things</text><text start="2391.77" dur="2.37">they&apos;re going to be different for</text><text start="2392.76" dur="6.269">different goals and different</text><text start="2394.14" dur="7.86">physiologies you had asked me previously</text><text start="2399.029" dur="5.221">a question about a diet that focuses</text><text start="2402.0" dur="4.64">mostly only on macros and being flexible</text><text start="2404.25" dur="2.39">with it</text><text start="2407.06" dur="7.27">if someone is focused on their physique</text><text start="2411.48" dur="6.93">and so they want to make sure that they</text><text start="2414.33" dur="5.85">are you know burning more calories than</text><text start="2418.41" dur="3.27">they are consuming in a day or consuming</text><text start="2420.18" dur="3.33">just enough of their big growing muscle</text><text start="2421.68" dur="4.56">so they&apos;re really kind of macro focused</text><text start="2423.51" dur="4.68">and being more flexible with which</text><text start="2426.24" dur="3.66">macros which foods they can get their</text><text start="2428.19" dur="3.45">macros from so they can actually sustain</text><text start="2429.9" dur="7.02">that for a while we totally get why that</text><text start="2431.64" dur="6.45">diet evolved and it is grossly under</text><text start="2436.92" dur="3.89">aware of lots of things that are</text><text start="2438.09" dur="5.25">relevant other than just like short-term</text><text start="2440.81" dur="5.26">physique and flexibility of how one does</text><text start="2443.34" dur="4.89">that right right and so I mean I correct</text><text start="2446.07" dur="3.9">me if I&apos;m wrong but I think that what</text><text start="2448.23" dur="4.26">you might mean is like most people that</text><text start="2449.97" dur="6.72">follow that kind of diet are uninformed</text><text start="2452.49" dur="4.89">on the importance of micronutrients so a</text><text start="2456.69" dur="2.94">few things</text><text start="2457.38" dur="4.08">micros micronutrients is going to be the</text><text start="2459.63" dur="4.11">first thing about that diet that is also</text><text start="2461.46" dur="5.85">several other things welcome to you</text><text start="2463.74" dur="6.36">could you potentially follow that kind</text><text start="2467.31" dur="7.83">of diet but also keep in mind all of</text><text start="2470.1" dur="8.82">your micronutrients kind of okay I&apos;m</text><text start="2475.14" dur="5.34">going to keep going so macros are you</text><text start="2478.92" dur="6.93">know where you get calories from right</text><text start="2480.48" dur="7.98">protein fat carbs and someone this is</text><text start="2485.85" dur="5.22">the normal definition but someone can</text><text start="2488.46" dur="4.68">also kind of think of water and fiber as</text><text start="2491.07" dur="3.21">macros they&apos;re not caloric sources but</text><text start="2493.14" dur="5.13">they&apos;re things you need a lot of each</text><text start="2494.28" dur="5.88">day right but then your micronutrients</text><text start="2498.27" dur="5.61">are your vitamins fat soluble water</text><text start="2500.16" dur="5.28">soluble vitamins your minerals your</text><text start="2503.88" dur="4.25">macro minerals and your trace minerals</text><text start="2505.44" dur="5.37">and then all the phytochemicals and</text><text start="2508.13" dur="6.22">polyphenols and enzymes and etc that</text><text start="2510.81" dur="8.46">come from a natural diet and a wide</text><text start="2514.35" dur="7.22">variety of natural foods you could say</text><text start="2519.27" dur="5.37">well can&apos;t I just take a multivitamin</text><text start="2521.57" dur="5.11">multi-mineral and not kind of worry</text><text start="2524.64" dur="4.47">about that I would say that&apos;s better</text><text start="2526.68" dur="6.75">than not doing it and a far away from</text><text start="2529.11" dur="9.45">actually having a evolutionarily</text><text start="2533.43" dur="7.2">relevant diet because the form of</text><text start="2538.56" dur="4.62">nutrients from</text><text start="2540.63" dur="5.19">natural sources let&apos;s just say from a</text><text start="2543.18" dur="7.89">plant source it could be plant or animal</text><text start="2545.82" dur="7.71">source you&apos;ll have a plant that has a</text><text start="2551.07" dur="4.62">mineral that is bound in multiple</text><text start="2553.53" dur="4.8">different forms so you know you&apos;re not</text><text start="2555.69" dur="5.33">just going to be dealing with say salary</text><text start="2558.33" dur="5.46">you&apos;ll have you&apos;ll have sodium as a</text><text start="2561.02" dur="7.27">little bit of sodium chloride and sodium</text><text start="2563.79" dur="6.27">bicarb and sodium by phosphate and you</text><text start="2568.29" dur="4.95">know many different forms you&apos;ll have</text><text start="2570.06" dur="5.25">you take a magnesium supplement and</text><text start="2573.24" dur="4.17">maybe it&apos;s magnesium citrate the body</text><text start="2575.31" dur="4.68">has give or take 13 different forms of</text><text start="2577.41" dur="4.44">magnesium that we know of that utilizes</text><text start="2579.99" dur="4.95">and very differently in different kinds</text><text start="2581.85" dur="6.63">of tissues so magnesium for brain health</text><text start="2584.94" dur="5.43">versus magnesium for its kind of</text><text start="2588.48" dur="3.47">electrolyte properties or in muscles or</text><text start="2590.37" dur="4.44">heart or adrenals different forms</text><text start="2591.95" dur="5.41">natural foods do a better job of giving</text><text start="2594.81" dur="5.72">you a wider variety of those things also</text><text start="2597.36" dur="5.37">often times with cofactors some of which</text><text start="2600.53" dur="3.43">won&apos;t be in the multi some of which we</text><text start="2602.73" dur="5.13">don&apos;t even understand that well that</text><text start="2603.96" dur="5.52">will affect absorption and then things</text><text start="2607.86" dur="5.91">that we don&apos;t even usually think of as</text><text start="2609.48" dur="8.58">micros like all of the antioxidants and</text><text start="2613.77" dur="10.11">all the polyphenols all of the</text><text start="2618.06" dur="7.71">plant-based enzymes etc so those matter</text><text start="2623.88" dur="5.43">a lot and what we know about life</text><text start="2625.77" dur="5.55">extension right now kind of the best</text><text start="2629.31" dur="4.19">thing we still know about life extension</text><text start="2631.32" dur="5.1">we know you know quite a few things is</text><text start="2633.5" dur="5.2">caloric restriction is meaningful for</text><text start="2636.42" dur="6.12">life extension in all mammals including</text><text start="2638.7" dur="6.15">humans and but when we look at the</text><text start="2642.54" dur="3.84">people from Blue Zones who have who</text><text start="2644.85" dur="3.26">lived the oldest the areas where you</text><text start="2646.38" dur="4.44">have the most people that live over 100</text><text start="2648.11" dur="4.03">there their diets can be a little bit</text><text start="2650.82" dur="4.83">different but one of the commonalities</text><text start="2652.14" dur="5.79">is that there they are in general taking</text><text start="2655.65" dur="5.13">in less calories than we are there in</text><text start="2657.93" dur="5.01">slight caloric deficit but they&apos;re</text><text start="2660.78" dur="5.4">taking their calories from micronutrient</text><text start="2662.94" dur="5.28">rich sources so their diet is lower in</text><text start="2666.18" dur="6.99">macronutrients higher and micronutrients</text><text start="2668.22" dur="5.79">which means they you know are in caloric</text><text start="2673.17" dur="3.63">restriction</text><text start="2674.01" dur="5.97">being a nutrient restriction interesting</text><text start="2676.8" dur="9.27">got it which is the exact opposite of</text><text start="2679.98" dur="11.91">empty carbs right so this is why getting</text><text start="2686.07" dur="9.87">food from organic biodynamic local</text><text start="2691.89" dur="7.71">seasonal rotating whole food etc sources</text><text start="2695.94" dur="8.58">actually makes a big difference as all</text><text start="2699.6" dur="7.59">of those other compounds now that&apos;s one</text><text start="2704.52" dur="6.18">thing right is that actually getting the</text><text start="2707.19" dur="6.48">good things from food love it macros is</text><text start="2710.7" dur="5.22">really important one on the other side</text><text start="2713.67" dur="4.83">not getting bad things from food is also</text><text start="2715.92" dur="5.58">really important and not getting bad</text><text start="2718.5" dur="6.9">things from food means inflammatory</text><text start="2721.5" dur="5.43">compounds so if and this is going to be</text><text start="2725.4" dur="4.38">a little bit the same for everyone and a</text><text start="2726.93" dur="5.55">little bit different most people will</text><text start="2729.78" dur="4.079">have inflammatory reactions or have a</text><text start="2732.48" dur="3.389">probability of having inflammatory</text><text start="2733.859" dur="6.621">reactions from a lot of common things so</text><text start="2735.869" dur="8.161">pasteurized dairy hybridized grains</text><text start="2740.48" dur="5.65">excessive sugar etc those are all going</text><text start="2744.03" dur="4.7">to be probably inflammatory for most</text><text start="2746.13" dur="5.31">people and you&apos;re not just talking about</text><text start="2748.73" dur="5.44">inflammation in the joint you&apos;re talking</text><text start="2751.44" dur="5.179">about internal inflammation throughout</text><text start="2754.17" dur="6.689">like systemic throughout the body right</text><text start="2756.619" dur="6.641">yes starting in the gut and then having</text><text start="2760.859" dur="6.721">systemic effects that originate in the</text><text start="2763.26" dur="7.89">gut and other are there is there</text><text start="2767.58" dur="8.52">anything any kind of identifying markers</text><text start="2771.15" dur="9.17">that people can look for it yeah yeah</text><text start="2776.1" dur="4.22">rather than than just going to a lab</text><text start="2781.4" dur="5.53">uh-oh I thought you were asking lab</text><text start="2784.05" dur="9.569">markers that&apos;s okay too yeah yeah the</text><text start="2786.93" dur="9.6">easiest the easiest first so

start="3102.41" dur="6.27">and then go meet them and see if you</text><text start="3103.67" dur="8.369">resonate done so originally I wanted to</text><text start="3108.68" dur="5.49">really dive into

dur="11.49">thought on sleep so I mean a classic</text><text start="3205.67" dur="9.419">example is people who are in the you</text><text start="3212.329" dur="4.111">know more raw food and more vegan and</text><text start="3215.089" dur="3.361">more kind of calorie restriction</text><text start="3216.44" dur="6.78">direction and then people who are in the</text><text start="3218.45" dur="7.8">more ketogenic diet primal diet paleo</text><text start="3223.22" dur="6.51">direction they both reference a lot of</text><text start="3226.25" dur="5.4">well done science right and there are</text><text

peoples</text><text start="3242.0" dur="8.279">genetics for different peoples</text><text start="3243.559" dur="8.581">physiology how they approach it etc so I</text><text start="3250.279" dur="6.171">would say there are general rules of</text><text start="3252.14" dur="8.28">thumb to say one should eat closer to</text><text start="3256.45" dur="6.73">the living ecosystem is a generally good</text><text start="3260.42" dur="6.179">rule of thumb meaning the more processed</text><text start="3263.18" dur="6.06">and packaged hybridized sprayed etc</text><text start="3266.599" dur="4.531">something is the worse it is in general</text><text start="3269.24" dur="5.01">it&apos;s not an absolute truth but it&apos;s a</text><text start="3271.13" dur="6.0">general truth and closer to things that</text><text start="3274.25" dur="4.92">have been what our bodies evolved to eat</text><text start="3277.13" dur="5.61">over very long periods of time and</text><text start="3279.17" dur="5.01">particularly also with less pesticides</text><text start="3282.74" dur="4.349">and herbicides and things that are</text><text start="3284.18" dur="5.01">designed to kill life on them and the</text><text start="3287.089" dur="4.111">more they come from healthy soils rather</text><text start="3289.19" dur="4.47">than pretty demineralized soils and the</text><text start="3291.2" dur="5.25">fresher they are versus they&apos;ve been out</text><text start="3293.66" dur="4.649">of the ground for pretty long time these</text><text start="3296.45" dur="7.28">are all

the</text><text start="3306.259" dur="3.961">board whether you&apos;re eating meats or not</text><text start="3308.299" dur="3.96">or these ones are not or nitrates or not</text><text start="3310.22" dur="5.46">like kind of dial that and second dial</text><text start="3312.259" dur="4.5">in this general approach to things that</text><text start="3315.68" dur="4.02">would have been part of a living</text><text start="3316.759" dur="4.77">ecosystem first and I would say then the</text><text start="3319.7" dur="5.369">next good rule of thumb is paying</text><text start="3321.529" dur="5.58">attention to how you feel as pretty</text><text start="3325.069" dur="3.331">closely as you eat different things so</text><text start="3327.109" dur="5.97">pay attention right after</text><text start="3328.4" dur="5.969">miel do you have a sense of over</text><text start="3333.079" dur="2.76">fullness in your belly like you&apos;re</text><text start="3334.369" dur="3.48">having a hard time digesting it do you</text><text start="3335.839" dur="4.801">have GI symptoms afterwards you get</text><text start="3337.849" dur="5.101">tired after eating in do you get

dur="3.869">afterwards the more you can do kind of a</text><text start="3347.779" dur="5.101">really attentive quantified self</text><text start="3349.819" dur="5.191">assessment just even spend a few weeks</text><text start="3352.88" dur="2.939">and journal what you&apos;re eating and then</text><text start="3355.01" dur="3.809">journal how you&apos;re feeling in</text><text start="3355.819" dur="4.5">association and dial it in the</text><text start="3358.819" dur="5.55">combination of the general rule of thumb</text><text start="3360.319" dur="6.061">of eating evolutionarily relevant foods</text><text start="3364.369" dur="3.841">and paying attention to which ones feel</text><text start="3366.38" dur="4.8">good for you that would be foundational</text><text start="3368.21" dur="6.72">then study specific diets on top of that</text><text start="3371.18" dur="5.639">and then do actual functional medicine</text><text start="3374.93" dur="4.169">where you look at your nutrient levels</text><text start="3376.819" dur="4.77">and your you know food allergies etc on</text><text start="3379.099" dur="5.311">top of that in terms of resources to go</text><text

there are generalized</text><text start="3527.71" dur="5.07">principles and then there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="3529.51" dur="7.08">room for adaptation like what someone</text><text start="3532.78" dur="7.11">should eat if they are training heavily</text><text start="3536.59" dur="4.83">versus not and training for powerlifting</text><text start="3539.89" dur="4.44">versus ultramarathons</text><text start="3541.42" dur="5.16">and you know based on their genetics and</text><text start="3544.33" dur="3.54">age and what kind of medical conditions</text><text start="3546.58" dur="5.36">they have that&apos;s all going to just be so</text><text start="3547.87" dur="8.58">so different one thing I will also say</text><text start="3551.94" dur="8.94">is be the idea that someone should not</text><text start="3556.45" dur="6.48">do kind of more advanced neuro hacking</text><text start="3560.88" dur="3.88">biohacking things if they don&apos;t have the</text><text start="3562.93" dur="3.36">foundations down this is not totally</text><text start="3564.76" dur="3.06">correct I wanted to take that</text><text start="3566.29" dur="5.37">perspective first because I wanted to</text><text start="3567.82" dur="6.45">emphasize foundations but say we look at</text><text start="3571.66" dur="5.76">either use of no tropics or you said EEG</text><text start="3574.27" dur="8.04">neurofeedback or different kinds of</text><text start="3577.42" dur="7.17">sleep tech sometimes even if someone&apos;s</text><text start="3582.31" dur="4.58">foundations are screwed they&apos;re screwed</text><text start="3584.59" dur="4.26">enough that the person&apos;s behavioral</text><text start="3586.89" dur="3.64">chemistry is out of whack enough that</text><text start="3588.85" dur="3.03">they just can&apos;t fix it it can&apos;t actually</text><text start="3590.53" dur="4.41">get themselves to eat better exercise</text><text start="3591.88" dur="4.11">well you know sleep well regularly</text><text start="3594.94" dur="3.09">enough</text><text start="3595.99" dur="5.07">and sometimes those interventions</text><text start="3598.03" dur="5.07">actually help the person enough that not</text><text start="3601.06" dur="3.75">only do they get the benefit of that</text><text start="3603.1" dur="3.87">intervention but it helps them get the</text><text start="3604.81" dur="4.74">Foundation&apos;s down better to change their</text><text start="3606.97" dur="5.43">behavior right absolutely so like one of</text><text start="3609.55" dur="5.7">the things that you know we have found</text><text start="3612.4" dur="7.469">with you know with quality and</text><text start="3615.25" dur="6.75">nootropics is if people are having</text><text start="3619.869" dur="3.931">issues with sleep if their underslept or</text><text start="3622.0" dur="4.35">if they have kind of overuse stimulants</text><text start="3623.8" dur="4.98">they might need to fix that first</text><text start="3626.35" dur="6.6">but otherwise if say their diet is poor</text><text start="3628.78" dur="10.02">or their exercises poor it&apos;s been very</text><text start="3632.95" dur="7.62">common that people will start I mean not</text><text start="3638.8" dur="3.54">all know perfectly the same quality</text><text start="3640.57" dur="4.35">specifically has a lot that balances</text><text start="3642.34" dur="5.82">that dopamine opioid access so it&apos;s</text><text start="3644.92" dur="6.93">actually helping work on the chemistry</text><text start="3648.16" dur="6.18">systems of motivation and behavior</text><text start="3651.85" dur="4.8">themselves we&apos;ve had a lot of people who</text><text start="3654.34" dur="4.62">just couldn&apos;t get themselves to be</text><text start="3656.65" dur="5.4">regular with exercise and diet they got</text><text start="3658.96" dur="5.01">on that and then they actually were so</text><text start="3662.05" dur="4.08">the general rule of thumb is someone</text><text start="3663.97" dur="3.66">does want to be focused on Foundations</text><text start="3666.13" dur="3.96">but if they&apos;re having a really hard time</text><text start="3667.63" dur="5.22">focusing with foundations finding tools</text><text start="3670.09" dur="4.44">that can not support them to keep not</text><text start="3672.85" dur="3.39">doing foundations and things that they</text><text start="3674.53" dur="3.329">can just augment it but things that can</text><text start="3676.24" dur="3.119">actually help them with the behavioral</text><text start="3677.859" dur="5.161">dynamics of doing the foundation will</text><text start="3679.359" dur="5.941">work that can be super useful that&apos;s a</text><text start="3683.02" dur="6.66">great perspective I love that even if it</text><text start="3685.3" dur="7.29">even if it is a placebo that gets them</text><text start="3689.68" dur="4.62">to change the behavior then the</text><text start="3692.59" dur="3.57">important part is that they are changing</text><text start="3694.3" dur="3.96">their behavior which oftentimes is the</text><text start="3696.16" dur="6.449">most important piece so the fact that</text><text start="3698.26" dur="6.15">what you guys do is so holistic and you</text><text start="3702.609" dur="3.601">know has such a long term effects is</text><text start="3704.41" dur="4.89">just that much better I love it</text><text start="3706.21" dur="5.88">yeah and you know sometimes sometimes</text><text start="3709.3" dur="4.91">therapy actually can the right kinds of</text><text start="3712.09" dur="6.3">therapy can really help someone change</text><text start="3714.21" dur="8.17">patterns underneath their behavior and</text><text start="3718.39" dur="7.44">like neurofeedback can help neuro</text><text start="3722.38" dur="5.28">regulatory patterns that can make a huge</text><text start="3725.83" dur="3.9">difference to just someone state of</text><text start="3727.66" dur="4.199">health and well-being overall stress</text><text start="3729.73" dur="4.35">assessing but also then how people react</text><text start="3731.859" dur="6.421">to stress and go into addictive patterns</text><text start="3734.08" dur="5.789">so we can say both sides means they get</text><text start="3738.28" dur="3.48">foundations first and then two advanced</text><text start="3739.869" dur="3.99">techniques we can also say if the</text><text start="3741.76" dur="3.84">advanced techniques can help you be able</text><text start="3743.859" dur="3.121">to do a better job of foundations that</text><text start="3745.6" dur="2.58">you&apos;ve had this new year&apos;s goals every</text><text start="3746.98" dur="2.85">year and not actually been able to</text><text start="3748.18" dur="3.6">stabilize don&apos;t keep trying and failing</text><text start="3749.83" dur="4.59">it the same thing see if additional</text><text start="3751.78" dur="7.35">tools can support you right I love that</text><text start="3754.42" dur="6.63">so look I am really dying to continue</text><text start="3759.13" dur="4.83">this conversation we&apos;ve opened so many</text><text start="3761.05" dur="5.19">doors but we&apos;re going to have to save</text><text start="3763.96" dur="3.87">some of it for the next time what what</text><text start="3766.24" dur="3.06">do you have what do you want to leave</text><text start="3767.83" dur="9.99">these listeners with or do you have an</text><text start="3769.3" dur="10.62">ask of them I enjoyed the time with you</text><text start="3777.82" dur="6.12">and I&apos;m looking forward to the next time</text><text start="3779.92" dur="5.73">and if this was interesting and people</text><text start="3783.94" dur="3.27">have questions on other topics my ass</text><text start="3785.65" dur="3.15">would be they just tell you what they&apos;re</text><text start="3787.21" dur="5.25">interested in that we talk about next</text><text start="3788.8" dur="8.96">time and other than that my ask would be</text><text start="3792.46" dur="8.64">that they take more responsibility for</text><text start="3797.76" dur="6.16">their own health and well-being in life</text><text start="3801.1" dur="4.5">and they did previously and that means</text><text start="3803.92" dur="3.21">study more so they can actually</text><text start="3805.6" dur="4.019">understand how to support themselves</text><text start="3807.13" dur="4.229">because that will put them not just in</text><text start="3809.619" dur="3.601">the best position for their own health</text><text start="3811.359" dur="3.151">but also in the best position to help</text><text start="3813.22" dur="3.899">other people and be an asset in the</text><text start="3814.51" dur="4.41">world that&apos;s phenomenal well I&apos;m</text><text start="3817.119" dur="6.091">definitely inspired I&apos;m going to make a</text><text start="3818.92" dur="6.3">few behavioural changes and then do some</text><text start="3823.21" dur="5.79">more self experimentation with quality</text><text start="3825.22" dur="5.73">myself and then once that is taking</text><text start="3829.0" dur="4.77">place then we&apos;ll then we&apos;ll follow up</text><text start="3830.95" dur="4.5">again done good conversation thank you</text><text start="3833.77" dur="2.72">so much Daniel this has been phenomenal</text><text start="3835.45"
