it&apos;s not just a weird</text><text start="156.38" dur="5.22">fetish topic and it&apos;s not just purely</text><text start="159.56" dur="5.91">there is some risk and we want to</text><text

dur="3.481">the guiding basis for how we utilize</text><text start="183.739" dur="2.611">that technological power well and make</text><text start="185.69" dur="2.4">good choices</text><text start="186.35" dur="3.48">in the presence of that we&apos;ve always had</text><text start="188.09" dur="4.71">a sense that human nature is a certain</text><text start="189.83" dur="6.03">thing fix can genetically or at whatever</text><text start="192.8" dur="5.31">level fix and then we&apos;re looking at good</text><text start="195.86" dur="3.39">behavior you know within that framework</text><text

and were optimized for it</text><text start="216.59" dur="6.119">we could work to chip our brains into a</text><text start="219.98" dur="4.68">eyes that could take us even further in</text><text start="222.709" dur="5.461">that direction of being able to win</text><text start="224.66" dur="5.49">those games we could engineer aggression</text><text start="228.17" dur="3.36">out of ourselves completely and so then</text><text start="230.15" dur="4.77">we start to say like wow those are</text><text start="231.53" dur="6.96">really different realities what do we</text><text start="234.92" dur="6.12">want well we want to win the game why do</text><text start="238.49" dur="3.96">we want to win there&apos;s an assumed game</text><text start="241.04" dur="3.419">that we&apos;re playing against whomever</text><text start="242.45" dur="3.21">right that some ways some in group is</text><text start="244.459" dur="3.78">playing against them out group and</text><text start="245.66" dur="5.01">whether it&apos;s US versus Russia versus</text><text start="248.239" dur="4.141">China or it&apos;s you know whatever in-group</text><text start="250.67" dur="3.0">out-group dynamic we say well what</text><text start="252.38" dur="3.15">happens when you keep playing that</text><text start="253.67" dur="3.629">in-group out-group game forever</text><text start="255.53" dur="4.44">well those games have always caused harm</text><text start="257.299" dur="4.891">they have a narrow set of metrics that</text><text start="259.97" dur="5.25">define a win and everything outside of</text><text start="262.19" dur="4.41">those metrics is externality so when</text><text start="265.22" dur="3.54">we&apos;re playing a win-lose game whether</text><text start="266.6" dur="4.5">it&apos;s personal in person or team on team</text><text start="268.76" dur="5.61">and whether the team is a tribe or a</text><text start="271.1" dur="5.46">country or a company or a race or</text><text start="274.37" dur="3.78">whatever it is right the in-group</text><text start="276.56" dur="3.48">competing against an out group for some</text><text start="278.15" dur="3.75">definition of a win we&apos;re directly</text><text start="280.04" dur="4.11">seeking to harm each other right - cause</text><text start="281.9" dur="3.93">the lose to each other and we&apos;re also</text><text start="284.15" dur="3.269">indirectly causing harm to the Commons</text><text start="285.83" dur="3.74">which is we&apos;re competing for the</text><text start="287.419" dur="5.341">extraction of scarce resource we are</text><text start="289.57" dur="4.78">externalizing cost pollution whatever it</text><text start="292.76" dur="3.36">is to the Commons if we&apos;re having if</text><text start="294.35" dur="4.47">we&apos;re competing militarily there&apos;s a</text><text start="296.12" dur="4.2">harm that comes from warfare right we&apos;re</text><text start="298.82" dur="3.18">polluting the information ecology</text><text start="300.32" dur="3.09">through disinformation to be able to</text><text start="302.0" dur="3.78">maintain the strategic competitive</text><text start="303.41" dur="5.61">advantage of some information we have so</text><text start="305.78" dur="7.44">all the risk games necessarily cause</text><text start="309.02" dur="7.2">harm so if you keep increasing your harm</text><text start="313.22" dur="4.71">causing capacity with technology and</text><text start="316.22" dur="2.759">technology that makes better technology</text><text start="317.93" dur="4.01">it makes better technology so</text><text start="318.979" dur="6.301">exponentially exponential harm causing</text><text start="321.94" dur="5.14">eventually taps out right eventually it</text><text start="325.28" dur="4.32">exceeds the capacity of the playing</text><text start="327.08" dur="5.339">field to handle and the level of harm is</text><text start="329.6" dur="4.26">no longer viable and it&apos;s an important</text><text start="332.419" dur="4.581">thing to think about that when we think</text><text start="333.86" dur="5.82">about the risks of weaponized drones or</text><text start="337.0" dur="4.419">CRISPR bio warfare or any of the like</text><text start="339.68" dur="3.0">really dreadful things that are very new</text><text start="341.419" dur="1.741">technologies that we could never do</text><text start="342.68" dur="2.84">before</text><text start="343.16" dur="4.62">they&apos;re not really different in</text><text start="345.52" dur="4.269">fundamental type than the things that</text><text start="347.78" dur="3.509">have always sucked like when we first</text><text start="349.789" dur="3.391">came out with catapults versus not</text><text start="351.289" dur="4.471">having those or cannons or whatever it</text><text start="353.18" dur="4.28">is they&apos;re just a lot more powerful of</text><text start="355.76" dur="5.01">the things that have always sucked and</text><text start="357.46" dur="5.41">but it&apos;s important to get that we have</text><text start="360.77" dur="4.11">been murdering other people in mass and</text><text start="362.87" dur="2.88">this thing called war is a reasonable</text><text start="364.88" dur="2.67">way to do</text><text start="365.75" dur="3.09">with a difference were to get ahead for</text><text start="367.55" dur="3.27">a long time for the whole history of the</text><text start="368.84" dur="4.5">thing we call civilization and we have</text><text start="370.82" dur="3.87">been Unruh new ibly you know plants out</text><text start="373.34" dur="2.76">of the ground in terms of agriculture</text><text start="374.69" dur="3.36">cutting trees or whatever in ways that</text><text start="376.1" dur="4.05">lead to desertification for thousands of</text><text start="378.05" dur="3.87">years all the early civilizations that</text><text start="380.15" dur="3.81">don&apos;t exist anymore don&apos;t exist anymore</text><text start="381.92" dur="4.14">because they actually led to their own</text><text start="383.96" dur="4.74">self-determination really critical ways</text><text start="386.06" dur="5.73">so it&apos;s not like war an environmental</text><text start="388.7" dur="7.83">destruction and etc is a new topic it</text><text start="391.79" dur="6.87">just if a Mayans fell or the Byzantine</text><text start="396.53" dur="3.9">or the Mesopotamian or the Roman even</text><text start="398.66" dur="3.39">the Roman Empire fell wasn&apos;t everything</text><text start="400.43" dur="4.739">there was a lot but it wasn&apos;t everything</text><text start="402.05" dur="6.42">but when you have the

dur="6.259">catastrophic for people and so yet that</text><text start="453.08" dur="5.61">rival risk games have always caused</text><text start="455.919" dur="5.441">behaviors of humans that have sucked but</text><text start="458.69" dur="5.039">exponential stock is existential as an</text><text start="461.36" dur="5.309">important way of thinking of it and that</text><text start="463.729" dur="4.621">means that we have to be different than</text><text start="466.669" dur="3.81">we have ever been in the history of the</text><text start="468.35" dur="3.51">thing we call civilization to simply not</text><text start="470.479" dur="3.391">extinct ourselves because the way we</text><text start="471.86" dur="4.17">have always been has been a smaller</text><text start="473.87" dur="4.26">scale of the same thing at this scale is</text><text start="476.03" dur="3.57">now extinction airing that&apos;s a big deal</text><text start="478.13" dur="3.09">because it means that the solutions</text><text start="479.6" dur="3.33">we&apos;re looking for do not look like</text><text start="481.22" dur="3.449">previous best practices because those</text><text start="482.93" dur="4.17">were practices at how to win win lose</text><text start="484.669" dur="4.531">games we&apos;re winning at win lose games is</text><text start="487.1" dur="3.6">now the Omni lose-lose generator right</text><text start="489.2" dur="3.75">it is now the thing that we can&apos;t keep</text><text start="490.7" dur="4.41">doing so we don&apos;t like to think this</text><text start="492.95" dur="3.81">deeply about things we like to take</text><text start="495.11" dur="3.26">whatever things have been like the good</text><text start="496.76" dur="3.65">best practices and figure</text><text start="498.37" dur="4.799">how to like iterate a tiny bit and run</text><text start="500.41" dur="4.95">with those things except the entire tool</text><text start="503.169" dur="4.411">set of best practices we have are</text><text start="505.36" dur="4.26">actually why we&apos;re at the brink of a</text><text start="507.58" dur="3.66">gazillion different X risk scenarios</text><text start="509.62" dur="4.82">that are the result of using those tool</text><text start="511.24" dur="6.179">sets and so words like capitalism and</text><text start="514.44" dur="4.33">science and technology and democracy are</text><text start="517.419" dur="3.06">like our favorite words because they</text><text start="518.77" dur="4.22">give us a lot of redshift they did they</text><text start="520.479" dur="5.131">also created a heap of problems and</text><text start="522.99" dur="4.72">problems are now catastrophic in scale</text><text start="525.61" dur="3.479">where the solutions need to be new stuff</text><text start="527.71" dur="3.03">now people freaked out because if you</text><text start="529.089" dur="2.911">say something other than capitalism they</text><text start="530.74" dur="2.34">think that you mean communism and you</text><text start="532.0" dur="2.55">want to take their stuff and have the</text><text start="533.08" dur="3.0">state force everyone to do shitty jobs</text><text start="534.55" dur="3.18">and if you say something of the</text><text start="536.08" dur="3.449">democracy again it&apos;s assumed that it&apos;s</text><text start="537.73" dur="3.18">gonna be like some kind of fascists</text><text start="539.529" dur="3.151">terrible thing and something other than</text><text start="540.91" dur="4.47">science means I could rest with religion</text><text start="542.68" dur="4.95">no I want to be very clear that I&apos;m not</text><text start="545.38" dur="3.77">proposing systems that suck

dur="4.68">deeper level of what we would actually</text><text start="553.51" dur="5.16">call innovation and novelty then have</text><text start="556.75" dur="4.38">been on the table so far so for instance</text><text start="558.67" dur="4.859">democracy you know when Churchill said</text><text start="561.13" dur="3.78">democracy is the single worst form of</text><text start="563.529" dur="3.541">governance ever created</text><text start="564.91" dur="4.22">save for all the other forms he was</text><text start="567.07" dur="4.019">saying something very very deep which is</text><text start="569.13" dur="3.76">democracy is the best form of government</text><text start="571.089" dur="3.811">we&apos;ve ever created and it&apos;s</text><text start="572.89" dur="4.47">terrible but all the other ones are even</text><text start="574.9" dur="5.61">worse because the idea of government or</text><text start="577.36" dur="4.5">governance is this really tricky thing</text><text start="580.51" dur="4.05">where we&apos;re trying to get lots of</text><text start="581.86" dur="4.56">different humans to cooperate or agree</text><text start="584.56" dur="4.08">or make choices together and like we</text><text start="586.42" dur="4.05">just suck at that and he was admitting</text><text start="588.64" dur="4.41">something very important and true and</text><text

dur="4.11">and so the reason I bring this up is</text><text start="1004.11" dur="4.89">because like democracy was great</text><text start="1005.91" dur="7.47">compared to just like a terrible

last</text><text start="1031.65" dur="3.929">so the thing that we call capitalism we</text><text start="1034.11" dur="4.199">all know the positive story there that</text><text start="1035.579" dur="4.441">it in cents people being self</text><text start="1038.309" dur="3.63">responsible and being industrious and</text><text start="1040.02" dur="3.78">seeking to bring better products

dur="3.87">that that story right there&apos;s some truth</text><text start="1055.98" dur="3.27">to it like there was some twisted</text><text start="1057.87" dur="3.09">democracy story and it

dur="4.47">enough the nature of what these types of</text><text start="1078.36" dur="3.69">structures are if I have a bunch of</text><text start="1080.16" dur="4.41">money it means I have concentrated</text><text start="1082.05" dur="4.29">choice making capacity because I can now</text><text start="1084.57" dur="4.02">want to make a choice that I can extend</text><text start="1086.34" dur="4.32">through a bunch of employees right I can</text><text start="1088.59" dur="3.81">have a bunch of them working aligned</text><text start="1090.66" dur="4.17">with my sense making on my behalf

dur="6.209">build something that extends my actuator</text><text start="1098.16" dur="6.3">capacity and so we recognize Oh a system</text><text start="1102.929" dur="3.541">that ends up determining

start="2375.65" dur="5.07">predate the environment so we modelled</text><text start="2379.16" dur="2.7">ourselves as apex predators right there</text><text start="2380.72" dur="2.73">was an easy thing to do we look around</text><text start="2381.86" dur="4.62">at nature and we were like we&apos;re kind of</text><text start="2383.45" dur="4.74">more like lions than gazelles we look a</text><text start="2386.48" dur="3.66">lot like chimpanzees they&apos;re kind of</text><text start="2388.19" dur="3.57">badass hunter apex predator they</text><text start="2390.14" dur="3.66">coordinate etcetera so we&apos;re like that</text><text start="2391.76" dur="4.14">cruel to the apex predator thing so we</text><text start="2393.8" dur="4.14">both want to see where we can get in the</text><text start="2395.9" dur="4.5">dominance hierarchies and we get add the</text><text start="2397.94" dur="4.53">prestige hierarchy but how we do within</text><text start="2400.4" dur="4.35">our tribe but in our tribe as a whole</text><text start="2402.47" dur="3.93">our species as a whole relative to the</text><text start="2404.75" dur="3.96">other species is ins kind of apex</text><text start="2406.4" dur="4.05">position there&apos;s a reason why we cannot</text><text start="2408.71" dur="2.4">think that way anymore and again we felt</text><text start="2410.45" dur="2.43">this way forever</text><text start="2411.11" dur="3.06">and we cannot take this way anymore when</text><text start="2412.88" dur="2.85">I say we thought this way forever I</text><text start="2414.17" dur="3.09">don&apos;t mean every indigenous tribe talk</text><text start="2415.73" dur="3.78">this way because they didn&apos;t write they</text><text start="2417.26" dur="4.38">had a web of life and were merely a</text><text start="2419.51" dur="3.6">strand and it types of thoughts but the</text><text start="2421.64" dur="2.7">ones that thought this way became more</text><text start="2423.11" dur="3.93">apex predators and killed those other</text><text start="2424.34" dur="4.83">people and so it was effective to try</text><text start="2427.04" dur="3.9">and do this apex predator thing up till</text><text start="2429.17" dur="3.12">now but now it also destroys everything</text><text start="2430.94" dur="3.63">so again the thing that has been</text><text start="2432.29" dur="4.14">adaptive is now anti adaptive which is</text><text start="2434.57" dur="3.36">why the thoughts that have made us win</text><text start="2436.43" dur="5.22">or the thoughts that make us extinct now</text><text start="2437.93" dur="7.95">and so if I take any pix predator how</text><text start="2441.65" dur="6.0">its ability to be a predator its ability</text><text start="2445.88" dur="3.15">to kill other things and compete with</text><text start="2447.65" dur="4.35">the other predators for who&apos;s most</text><text start="2449.03" dur="5.73">badass is pretty fixed and it&apos;s pretty</text><text start="2452.0" dur="5.58">symmetrically bound with its environment</text><text start="2454.76" dur="4.65">so lions can&apos;t get better at killing</text><text start="2457.58" dur="4.8">faster than gazelles get better at</text><text start="2459.41" dur="5.1">running and so they Co evolved where the</text><text start="2462.38" dur="3.6">lion slowly get a little bit better at</text><text start="2464.51" dur="2.85">some things and the gazelles also get</text><text start="2465.98" dur="3.45">better at other things because if the</text><text start="2467.36" dur="3.45">Lions just rapidly got way better they&apos;d</text><text start="2469.43" dur="3.09">kill all the gazelles and then debase</text><text start="2470.81" dur="3.48">their own capacity to keep living and</text><text start="2472.52" dur="3.81">then they&apos;d be extinct if great white</text><text start="2474.29" dur="3.33">could make mile-long drift nets and just</text><text start="2476.33" dur="3.36">take all the fish out of the</text><text start="2477.62" dur="4.17">ocean and reproduce at an exponential</text><text start="2479.69" dur="3.72">rate like they would have already self</text><text start="2481.79" dur="3.6">induced extinction but they can&apos;t all</text><text start="2483.41" dur="4.2">the years the great rice never got a</text><text start="2485.39" dur="4.35">driftnet but we have drift nets and we</text><text start="2487.61" dur="4.34">have nuclear weapons and we have D nines</text><text start="2489.74" dur="5.22">and we have the ability to</text><text start="2491.95" dur="7.07">technologically extend our predatory</text><text start="2494.96" dur="6.58">capacity and to do so in a way that</text><text start="2499.02" dur="4.57">exponential and that makes us completely</text><text start="2501.54" dur="4.27">asymmetric with the environment that we</text><text start="2503.59" dur="4.11">depend on so again I come back to the</text><text start="2505.81" dur="4.32">lion and they say all right the most</text><text start="2507.7" dur="5.58">badass lion the most badass gorilla is</text><text start="2510.13" dur="4.11">not like 10x more badass than the next</text><text start="2513.28" dur="4.77">most badass grow up</text><text start="2514.24" dur="5.4">it&apos;s like marginally better right like</text><text start="2518.05" dur="2.97">marginally can win in a fight and only</text><text start="2519.64" dur="3.39">for a pretty short period of time before</text><text start="2521.02" dur="5.85">the next guy takes it but then you look</text><text start="2523.03" dur="5.67">at like a Putin or a Trump and you say</text><text start="2526.87" dur="3.96">how much military capacity does that one</text><text start="2528.7" dur="3.69">person have to bear if they wanted to or</text><text start="2530.83" dur="4.2">economic capacity compared to say a</text><text start="2532.39" dur="4.71">homeless guy you look at the spread and</text><text start="2535.03" dur="3.69">you&apos;re like oh this is a very different</text><text start="2537.1" dur="4.44">distribution of power than any other</text><text start="2538.72" dur="5.55">species has other species did not have a</text><text start="2541.54" dur="5.82">million x power dynamics within the same</text><text start="2544.27" dur="5.64">species or a billion X that like it was</text><text start="2547.36" dur="4.23">freaking tremendous or that much more</text><text start="2549.91" dur="4.2">power relative to their environment so</text><text start="2551.59" dur="4.89">if the Lions could get technologically</text><text start="2554.11" dur="4.41">more advanced in their predation faster</text><text start="2556.48" dur="3.99">than gazelles could it would debase the</text><text start="2558.52" dur="3.75">stability of the entire ecosystem the</text><text start="2560.47" dur="3.81">thing to realize is like if a cancer</text><text start="2562.27" dur="3.24">cell starts replicating in a way that&apos;s</text><text start="2564.28" dur="2.82">good for it it&apos;s actually getting more</text><text start="2565.51" dur="4.08">sugar and replicating faster inside the</text><text start="2567.1" dur="4.17">body if it keeps doing that it kills its</text><text start="2569.59" dur="4.05">host and kills itself it is ultimately</text><text start="2571.27" dur="4.59">suicidal its own short-term success is</text><text start="2573.64" dur="4.35">suicidal viruses that kill people too</text><text start="2575.86" dur="3.54">quickly don&apos;t propagate for very long</text><text start="2577.99" dur="2.85">because they kill their hosts they don&apos;t</text><text start="2579.4" dur="3.66">get a

start="2584.47" dur="3.18">longer period of time to get a chance to</text><text start="2585.73" dur="3.36">propagate so if there was a species that</text><text start="2587.65" dur="2.82">was so good at hunting that it killed</text><text start="2589.09" dur="3.78">everything in its environment then it</text><text start="2590.47" dur="4.62">would go extinct so it&apos;s not the most</text><text

dur="4.49">yeah this whole idea of survival of the</text><text start="2621.73" dur="5.49">fittest is kind of challenged with this</text><text start="2623.43" dur="5.53">concept because at no point are

dur="3.02">infinitely</text><text start="2631.95" dur="4.17">like it has to go through that phase</text><text start="2634.11" dur="5.13">shift yeah survival of the fittest was</text><text start="2636.12" dur="6.72">something that had a local truth but was</text><text start="2639.24" dur="4.62">not the only global phenomena that was</text><text start="2642.84" dur="3.12">operating because there was also a</text><text start="2643.86" dur="4.2">tremendous amount of cooperation it was</text><text start="2645.96" dur="3.57">happening in cooperation within members</text><text

again it was like</text><text start="2653.67" dur="3.78">almost the idea of competition it&apos;s a</text><text start="2655.92" dur="3.45">hyper normal stimuli it was like an</text><text

rights to rebel with fittest</text><text start="2685.01" dur="5.23">so there is this hyper normal stimuli</text><text start="2687.9" dur="5.19">that made us actually miss emphasized</text><text

dur="5.46">the way we have been applying that</text><text start="2702.45" dur="5.52">thinking which is that some individual</text><text start="2705.03" dur="5.16">agents or some in groups

that</text><text start="2721.47" dur="5.04">has always been true I&apos;m not criticising</text><text start="2724.98" dur="5.34">that that was always true and even</text><text start="2726.51" dur="7.02">necessary because if one tribe killed</text><text start="2730.32" dur="4.71">another tribe and their life got better</text><text start="2733.53" dur="2.97">because now the other tribe

so</text><text start="2928.249" dur="3.33">the first one is this topic we&apos;ve been</text><text start="2930.23" dur="4.129">talking about and we talked about</text><text start="2931.579"

start="2980.569" dur="4.74">and deploying those technologies or we</text><text start="2983.599" dur="5.071">self-terminate so this is the first</text><text start="2985.309" dur="5.93">design criteria is that we have to</text><text start="2988.67" dur="5.339">create rigorously anti rival risk</text><text start="2991.239" dur="6.52">environments it doesn&apos;t end up being all</text><text start="2994.009" dur="8.161">of it I&apos;ll do two generator functions</text><text start="2997.759" dur="7.86">that&apos;s one and that is what we see in</text><text start="3002.17" dur="6.839">terms

biosphere collapse stuff</text><text start="3018.309" dur="4.71">is also related to tech getting bigger</text><text start="3020.799" dur="3.841">right as we&apos;re fishing out more fish as</text><text start="3023.019" dur="3.181">we&apos;re getting more co2 it also relates</text><text start="3024.64" dur="3.929">that but it&apos;s a slightly different thing</text><text start="3026.2" dur="5.19">that we look at here which is whether</text><text start="3028.569" dur="3.841">we&apos;re talking about co2 in the air or</text><text start="3031.39" dur="4.35">mercury</text><text

don&apos;t need to solve the</text><text start="3053.05" dur="3.75">dead zones issue or the co2 issue or</text><text start="3055.45" dur="3.03">that we have to solve all of those</text><text

dur="6.36">the fish species extinction biodiversity</text><text start="3071.47" dur="6.57">loss peak nitrogen peak oil etc those</text><text start="3074.83" dur="5.82">are all where we are using something in</text><text start="3078.04" dur="3.99">a way that depletes it then it gets</text><text start="3080.65" dur="2.67">turned into trash or pollution on the</text><text start="3082.03" dur="4.41">other side were to accumulate somewhere</text><text start="3083.32" dur="5.97">so we can define toxicity formally as</text><text start="3086.44" dur="5.79">depletion or accumulation because of an</text><text start="3089.29" dur="5.67">open loop in a network diagram and if</text><text start="3092.23" dur="4.71">the loop was closed the things wouldn&apos;t</text><text start="3094.96" dur="3.3">accumulate they would go back to the</text><text start="3096.94" dur="3.18">source of where we would get something</text><text start="3098.26" dur="4.08">from so it wouldn&apos;t have to deplete and</text><text start="3100.12" dur="3.81">we noticed that when we see any kind of</text><text start="3102.34" dur="3.75">natural system we go to an ecosystem</text><text start="3103.93" dur="4.29">whether it&apos;s of coral reef or a forest</text><text start="3106.09" dur="4.62">or whatever won&apos;t go to forest there is</text><text start="3108.22" dur="5.09">no trash the body of

start="3116.02" dur="3.54">processes don&apos;t matter what it is</text><text start="3117.34" dur="3.66">anything you can think about that is</text><text start="3119.56" dur="3.3">part of that

dur="4.32">comprehensive loop closure one of the</text><text start="3138.82" dur="4.23">things we noticed about the human design</text><text start="3140.62" dur="4.2">systems is open loops everywhere
