there&apos;s</text><text start="3.81" dur="4.619">some more examples that are important so</text><text start="6.299" dur="3.001">we talked about weaponizing transparency</text><text start="8.429" dur="4.83">and then we talked about weaponizing</text><text start="9.3" dur="7.38">kindness I have seen so people can</text><text start="13.259" dur="5.85">weaponize their own vulnerability where</text><text start="16.68" dur="3.99">it&apos;s like I watched after bren√© Brown</text><text start="19.109" dur="4.68">came out and did her stuff on</text><text start="20.67" dur="5.519">vulnerability that then I saw all these</text><text start="23.789" dur="4.591">things on Facebook of life coaches</text><text start="26.189" dur="3.84">crying in the camera with tears in their</text><text start="28.38" dur="4.289">eyes showing how vulnerable they are and</text><text start="30.029" dur="4.261">you know then if you want to learn how</text><text start="32.669" dur="4.351">to be vulnerable to their packages for</text><text start="34.29" dur="4.679">sale and like oh like that</text><text start="37.02" dur="5.49">that&apos;s like weaponizing be a virtue</text><text start="38.969" dur="5.041">signaling where the more vulnerable</text><text start="42.51" dur="3.63">thing if they were being really</text><text start="44.01" dur="3.54">vulnerable wouldn&apos;t be them crying about</text><text start="46.14" dur="3.63">this thing that they&apos;ve already resolved</text><text start="47.55" dur="3.63">and is really not actually consequential</text><text start="49.77" dur="3.42">to them which is not real vulnerability</text><text start="51.18" dur="4.35">it would be them saying I&apos;m broke right</text><text start="53.19" dur="4.549">now guys and I need to pay the bills and</text><text start="55.53" dur="4.829">I really want you to buy my package and</text><text start="57.739" dur="5.021">I think that it&apos;s beneficial for some</text><text start="60.359" dur="3.931">people and like that would be often</text><text start="62.76" dur="6.359">actual authenticity and vulnerability</text><text start="64.29" dur="6.509">which very rarely happens I have seen</text><text start="69.119" dur="7.381">like one of the worst ones is</text><text start="70.799" dur="7.11">weaponizing apology and remorse so again</text><text start="76.5" dur="9.479">associated with something like</text><text start="77.909" dur="10.951">narcissism generally if the person feels</text><text start="85.979" dur="4.651">that the person who&apos;s challenging them</text><text start="88.86" dur="5.73">or upset with them doesn&apos;t have power</text><text start="90.63" dur="6.21">and they do they will just say this is</text><text start="94.59" dur="4.77">your ego making up nonsense and though</text><text start="96.84" dur="5.04">Gaslight them but if the other person</text><text start="99.36" dur="4.2">has power and they can&apos;t do that because</text><text start="101.88" dur="3.599">it&apos;s a whole group of people calling</text><text start="103.56" dur="4.11">them out or it&apos;s a very someone with a</text><text start="105.479" dur="4.14">lot of following or whatever then the</text><text start="107.67" dur="4.83">most effective game theoretic thing for</text><text start="109.619" dur="5.28">them to do might be to start crying and</text><text start="112.5" dur="4.56">say oh my god I&apos;m so sorry this goes</text><text start="114.899" dur="3.9">back to a childhood wound of mine and</text><text start="117.06" dur="3.449">it&apos;s really vulnerable and I&apos;m working</text><text start="118.799" dur="3.57">on it and I thought I had healed this</text><text start="120.509" dur="4.381">pattern and still showing up thank you</text><text start="122.369" dur="3.841">for showing it to me I&apos;m really going to</text><text start="124.89" dur="5.369">work on it I want you guys to hold me</text><text start="126.21" dur="5.639">accountable and I have seen people do</text><text start="130.259" dur="3.431">this with tears in their eyes and a week</text><text start="131.849" dur="3.641">later do the exact same thing</text><text start="133.69" dur="4.74">powerful people weren&apos;t around to hold</text><text start="135.49" dur="6.66">them accountable and that is basically</text><text start="138.43" dur="5.94">weaponizing fake remorse and apology and</text><text start="142.15" dur="4.02">whatever so you have to so if I notice</text><text start="144.37" dur="3.57">that happen what I know is that no words</text><text start="146.17" dur="5.79">that person says will mean anything to</text><text start="147.94" dur="5.25">me so I would need to see if the that</text><text start="151.96" dur="3.15">doesn&apos;t mean that I&apos;ve closed off</text><text start="153.19" dur="4.89">redemptive possibilities it means I need</text><text start="155.11" dur="4.14">a different kind of signal so if the</text><text start="158.08" dur="3.9">person said no I&apos;ve really made a change</text><text start="159.25" dur="4.38">I&apos;d be like awesome I&apos;m gonna watch that</text><text start="161.98" dur="6.96">that bad behavior doesn&apos;t happen for</text><text start="163.63" dur="6.96">three or five years and in including</text><text start="168.94" dur="5.28">where you have to actually face</text><text start="170.59" dur="5.88">consequential things right and so again</text><text start="174.22" dur="3.87">the guy beats his wife when he&apos;s drunk</text><text start="176.47" dur="2.73">and then the next day apologized I love</text><text start="178.09" dur="2.76">you I&apos;m sorry I&apos;m never gonna drink</text><text start="179.2" dur="3.69">again and whatever right and the pattern</text><text start="180.85" dur="4.41">keeps rinse repeat it&apos;s not an apology</text><text start="182.89" dur="4.08">at the level that will actually change</text><text start="185.26" dur="5.16">the pattern therefore it is a weapon to</text><text start="186.97" dur="5.58">keep her bound to an abuse cycle so when</text><text start="190.42" dur="6.72">is an apology or remorse or</text><text start="192.55" dur="6.87">accountability real well it it&apos;s when it</text><text start="197.14" dur="5.75">is at the level of depth that will</text><text start="199.42" dur="5.76">actually change the behavior if it isn&apos;t</text><text start="202.89" dur="4.8">then whether the person thinks they mean</text><text start="205.18" dur="8.16">it in the moment or not you shouldn&apos;t</text><text start="207.69" dur="7.63">trust it right so I I can obviously give</text><text start="213.34" dur="3.84">a million examples what I&apos;m hoping is</text><text start="215.32" dur="5.28">I&apos;ve given enough examples that you can</text><text start="217.18" dur="5.25">start finding your own examples now does</text><text start="220.6" dur="3.84">this mean that anytime someone is crying</text><text start="222.43" dur="3.96">and apologizing that they are</text><text start="224.44" dur="3.42">weaponizing it not earnest now sometimes</text><text start="226.39" dur="3.599">they might really be earnest and they&apos;re</text><text start="227.86" dur="3.75">gonna shift forever or they&apos;re going to</text><text start="229.989" dur="4.101">start a process that will work with a</text><text start="231.61" dur="4.409">difficult you know difficult set of</text><text start="234.09" dur="3.85">dynamics that might involve a little bit</text><text start="236.019" dur="3.451">of relapse but earnestly is oriented in</text><text start="237.94" dur="4.26">a different direction versus they&apos;re</text><text start="239.47" dur="4.38">just doing the mia Copa they need to to</text><text start="242.2" dur="3.12">get out of accountability in the moment</text><text start="243.85" dur="2.76">and then go back to power seeking as</text><text start="245.32" dur="3.6">soon as everyone&apos;s attention is off of</text><text start="246.61" dur="4.349">them which is why three months isn&apos;t</text><text start="248.92" dur="4.2">enough right and now can some people</text><text start="250.959" dur="4.43">play a long game sure we have seen some</text><text start="253.12" dur="5.22">great political strategists</text><text start="255.389" dur="4.511">so even the principle of wait a few</text><text start="258.34" dur="4.19">years is not a perfect principle</text><text start="259.9" dur="2.63">generally fun</text><text start="267.44" dur="5.18">you</text><text start="268.2" dur="4.42">[Music]</text></transcript>
