find appealing is</text><text start="37.68" dur="5.52">it parents</text><text start="40.399" dur="5.121">meaning a very close-knit tribes of</text><text start="43.2" dur="5.44">conditioning that&apos;s the most essential</text><text start="45.52" dur="4.32">and then uh you and michael malus would</text><text start="48.64" dur="4.48">uh</text><text start="49.84" dur="5.6">happily agree that it&apos;s anarchy or the</text><text start="53.12" dur="4.56">state should be</text><text start="55.44" dur="3.759">dissolved or destroyed or burned to the</text><text start="57.68"

it</text><text start="67.04" dur="4.88">is the state</text><text start="68.0" dur="4.4">can the state be good or is the state</text><text start="71.92" dur="4.4">bad</text><text start="72.4" dur="6.079">for the condition of a beautiful world</text><text start="76.32" dur="3.92">a or b this is like an s you like tests</text><text start="78.479" dur="2.801">you like to give these uh simplified</text><text start="80.24" dur="4.559">good or bad things</text><text start="81.28" dur="5.28">um what i like the state</text><text start="84.799" dur="3.121">that we live in currently the united</text><text start="86.56" dur="3.36">states federal government to</text><text start="87.92" dur="3.28">stop existing today no i would really</text><text start="89.92" dur="3.839">not like that um</text><text start="91.2" dur="4.48">i think that would be not quite bad for</text><text start="93.759" dur="5.441">the world in a lot of ways</text><text start="95.68" dur="6.079">uh do i think that it&apos;s a</text><text start="99.2" dur="4.4">optimal social system and maximally uh</text><text start="101.759" dur="3.441">just inhumane and all those things and i</text><text start="103.6" dur="4.0">wanted to continue as is no</text><text start="105.2" dur="4.4">also not that um but i am much more</text><text start="107.6" dur="3.04">interested in it being able to evolve to</text><text start="109.6" dur="4.879">a better thing</text><text start="110.64" dur="4.799">without going through the catastrophe</text><text start="114.479" dur="3.68">phase that i think</text><text start="115.439" dur="4.561">it&apos;s just non-existence would give so</text><text start="118.159" dur="4.96">what size</text><text start="120.0" dur="5.28">of state is good in a sense like</text><text start="123.119" dur="3.6">do we should we as a human society as</text><text start="125.28" dur="3.28">this world becomes more globalized</text><text start="126.719" dur="3.361">should we be constantly striving to</text><text start="128.56" dur="4.399">reduce</text><text start="130.08" dur="4.56">the set you we can we can put on a map</text><text start="132.959" dur="5.441">like right now literally</text><text start="134.64" dur="4.72">like the the centers of power in the</text><text start="138.4" dur="3.36">world</text><text start="139.36" dur="3.68">some of them are tech companies some of</text><text start="141.76" dur="3.28">them are governments</text><text start="143.04" dur="3.52">should we be trying to as much as</text><text start="145.04" dur="3.76">possible decentralize</text><text start="146.56" dur="3.6">the power to where it&apos;s very difficult</text><text start="148.8" dur="4.719">to point on the map</text><text start="150.16" dur="6.4">the centers of power and that means</text><text start="153.519" dur="4.641">making a state however there&apos;s a bunch</text><text start="156.56" dur="2.88">of different ways to make the government</text><text start="158.16" dur="5.12">much smaller</text><text start="159.44" dur="6.96">that could be reducing</text><text start="163.28" dur="5.2">in the united states reducing the</text><text start="166.4" dur="3.119">the funding for the government all those</text><text start="168.48" dur="2.88">kinds of things their set of</text><text start="169.519" dur="4.881">responsibilities</text><text start="171.36" dur="6.08">the the set of powers it could be</text><text start="174.4" dur="6.16">i mean this is far out but making</text><text start="177.44" dur="4.159">more nations or maybe nations not in the</text><text start="180.56" dur="2.959">space that are</text><text start="181.599" dur="3.681">defined by geographic location but</text><text start="183.519" dur="3.601">rather in the space of ideas</text><text start="185.28" dur="3.599">which is what anarchy is about so</text><text start="187.12" dur="4.0">anarchy is about forming collectives</text><text start="188.879" dur="4.321">based on their set of ideas</text><text start="191.12" dur="4.56">and doing so dynamically not based on</text><text start="193.2" dur="5.52">where you were born and so on</text><text start="195.68" dur="5.12">i think we can say that the</text><text start="198.72" dur="4.0">natural state of humans if we want to</text><text start="200.8" dur="5.2">describe such a thing</text><text start="202.72" dur="6.4">was to live in tribes</text><text start="206.0" dur="4.879">that were below the dunbar number</text><text start="209.12" dur="4.24">meaning that for a few hundred thousand</text><text start="210.879" dur="4.321">years of human history</text><text start="213.36" dur="3.12">all of the groups of humans mostly</text><text start="215.2" dur="2.64">stayed under that size</text><text start="216.48" dur="3.44">and whenever we&apos;d get up to that size it</text><text start="217.84" dur="4.0">would end up cleaving and so it seems</text><text start="219.92" dur="3.599">like there&apos;s a pretty strong</text><text start="221.84" dur="3.119">but there weren&apos;t individual humans out</text><text start="223.519" dur="3.681">in the wild doing really well right so</text><text start="224.959" dur="4.721">we were a group animal but with groups</text><text start="227.2" dur="4.319">that had a specific size so we could say</text><text start="229.68" dur="3.44">in a way humans were being domesticated</text><text start="231.519" dur="3.121">by those groups they were learning how</text><text start="233.12" dur="2.16">to have certain rules to participate</text><text start="234.64" dur="2.08">with the group</text><text start="235.28" dur="3.92">without which you get kicked out but</text><text start="236.72" dur="5.04">that that&apos;s still the wild state of</text><text start="239.2" dur="3.52">people and and maybe it&apos;s useful to do</text><text start="241.76" dur="2.88">as a side</text><text start="242.72" dur="4.32">statement which i&apos;ve recently looked at</text><text start="244.64" dur="4.48">a bunch of papers around dunbar&apos;s number</text><text start="247.04" dur="3.52">where the mean is actually 150. if you</text><text start="249.12" dur="4.24">actually look at the original paper it&apos;s</text><text start="250.56" dur="5.12">a range it&apos;s really a range so it&apos;s</text><text start="253.36" dur="3.92">actually some somewhere under a thousand</text><text start="255.68" dur="3.519">so it&apos;s a range from like two to five</text><text start="257.28" dur="3.359">hundred or whatever it is but like you</text><text start="259.199" dur="4.0">could argue that the</text><text start="260.639" dur="4.241">uh i think it actually is exactly two uh</text><text start="263.199" dur="3.44">two the range is</text><text start="264.88" dur="3.92">two to five hundred and twenty something</text><text start="266.639" dur="5.361">like that and this is</text><text start="268.8" dur="4.24">the mean that&apos;s taken crudely it&apos;s not a</text><text start="272.0" dur="4.4">very good paper</text><text start="273.04" dur="6.4">the the in terms of the actual numerical</text><text start="276.4" dur="5.2">numerically speaking but it&apos;d be</text><text start="279.44" dur="4.96">interesting if there&apos;s a bunch of dunbar</text><text start="281.6" dur="4.08">numbers that could be computed for</text><text start="284.4" dur="2.239">particular environments particular</text><text start="285.68" dur="2.56">conditions so on</text><text start="286.639" dur="3.441">it is very true that they&apos;re likely to</text><text start="288.24" dur="4.0">be something small</text><text start="290.08" dur="4.24">you know under a million but it&apos;d be</text><text start="292.24" dur="4.399">interesting if we can expand that number</text><text start="294.32" dur="3.84">in interesting ways that will change the</text><text start="296.639" dur="2.721">fabric of this conversation i just want</text><text start="298.16" dur="3.52">to kind of throw that in there</text><text start="299.36" dur="3.279">i don&apos;t know the if the 150 is baked in</text><text start="301.68" dur="2.56">somehow in the heart</text><text start="302.639" dur="2.881">into the hardware we can talk about some</text><text start="304.24" dur="2.48">of the things that it probably has to do</text><text start="305.52" dur="4.239">with</text><text start="306.72" dur="4.72">up to a certain number of people</text><text start="309.759" dur="3.601">and this is going to be variable based</text><text start="311.44" dur="3.759">on the social technologies that mediate</text><text start="313.36" dur="5.839">it to some degree we can talk about that</text><text start="315.199" dur="5.601">in a minute um</text><text start="319.199" dur="3.641">up to a certain number of people</text><text start="320.8" dur="3.839">everybody can know everybody else pretty</text><text start="322.84" dur="3.0">intimately so let&apos;s go ahead and just</text><text start="324.639" dur="4.881">take 150</text><text start="325.84" dur="3.68">as a as an average number</text><text start="331.68" dur="3.28">everybody can know everyone intimately</text><text start="333.28" dur="4.72">enough that</text><text start="334.96" dur="5.04">if your actions made anyone else do</text><text start="338.0" dur="3.44">poorly it&apos;s your extended family and</text><text start="340.0" dur="2.96">you&apos;re stuck living with them</text><text start="341.44" dur="3.36">and you know who they are and there&apos;s no</text><text start="342.96" dur="3.36">anonymous people there&apos;s no just them</text><text start="344.8" dur="5.679">and over there</text><text start="346.32" dur="5.599">and that&apos;s one part of what leads to a</text><text start="350.479" dur="2.401">kind of tribal process where it&apos;s good</text><text start="351.919" dur="2.72">for the individual and good for the</text><text start="352.88" dur="4.8">whole has a coupling</text><text start="354.639" dur="4.721">also below that scale</text><text start="357.68" dur="3.92">everyone is somewhat aware of what</text><text start="359.36" dur="5.119">everybody else is doing there&apos;s not</text><text start="361.6" dur="4.48">groups that are very siloed and as a</text><text start="364.479" dur="2.961">result it&apos;s actually very hard to get</text><text start="366.08" dur="4.08">away with bad behavior</text><text start="367.44" dur="4.479">there&apos;s a forced kind of transparency</text><text start="370.16" dur="3.28">and so you don&apos;t need kind of like the</text><text start="371.919" dur="4.321">state</text><text start="373.44" dur="4.16">in in that way but lying to people</text><text start="376.24" dur="2.88">doesn&apos;t actually get you ahead</text><text start="377.6" dur="3.2">sociopathic behavior doesn&apos;t get you</text><text start="379.12" dur="4.96">ahead because it gets seen</text><text start="380.8" dur="4.56">and so there&apos;s a conditioning</text><text start="384.08" dur="2.72">environment where the</text><text start="385.36" dur="3.52">individuals behaving in a way that is</text><text start="386.8" dur="4.72">aligned with the interest of the tribe</text><text start="388.88" dur="3.28">is what gets conditioned when it gets to</text><text start="391.52" dur="3.679">be a much</text><text start="392.16" dur="5.2">larger system it becomes easier to</text><text start="395.199" dur="4.161">hide certain things from the group as a</text><text start="397.36" dur="3.44">whole as well as to be less emotionally</text><text start="399.36" dur="4.16">bound to a bunch of anonymous</text><text start="400.8" dur="3.76">people i would say there&apos;s also a</text><text start="403.52" dur="4.08">communication</text><text start="404.56" dur="4.4">protocol where up to about that number</text><text start="407.6" dur="3.439">of people</text><text start="408.96" dur="3.92">we could all sit around a tribal council</text><text start="411.039" dur="3.6">and be part of a conversation around a</text><text start="412.88" dur="3.28">really big decision do we migrate do we</text><text start="414.639" dur="2.56">not migrate do we you know some</text><text start="416.16" dur="4.08">something like that do we</text><text start="417.199" dur="3.681">get rid of this person and why why would</text><text start="420.24" dur="5.359">i want</text><text start="420.88" dur="7.28">to agree to be a part of a larger group</text><text start="425.599" dur="3.6">where everyone can&apos;t be part of that</text><text start="428.16" dur="4.24">council and so</text><text start="429.199" dur="4.241">i am going to now be subject to law that</text><text start="432.4" dur="2.32">i have no say in</text><text start="433.44" dur="2.879">if i could be part of a smaller group</text><text start="434.72" dur="3.199">that could still survive and i get a say</text><text start="436.319" dur="3.521">in the law that i&apos;m subject to so i</text><text start="437.919" dur="3.68">think the cleaving</text><text start="439.84" dur="3.52">and a way we can look at it beyond the</text><text start="441.599" dur="3.361">dunbar number two is we can look at that</text><text start="443.36" dur="3.6">a civilization has</text><text start="444.96" dur="3.679">binding energy that is holding them</text><text start="446.96" dur="3.2">together and has cleaving energy and if</text><text start="448.639" dur="3.761">the binding energy exceeds the cleaving</text><text start="450.16" dur="4.0">energy that civilization will last</text><text start="452.4" dur="3.199">and so there are things that we can do</text><text start="454.16" dur="2.879">to decrease the cleaving energy within</text><text start="455.599" dur="2.32">the society things we can do to increase</text><text start="457.039" dur="2.56">the binding energy</text><text start="457.919" dur="3.28">i think naturally we saw that had</text><text start="459.599" dur="4.641">certain characteristics up to a certain</text><text start="461.199" dur="4.801">size kind of tribalism that</text><text start="464.24" dur="3.76">ended with a few things it ended with</text><text start="466.0" dur="5.039">people having migrated enough that</text><text start="468.0" dur="4.8">when you started to get resource wars it</text><text start="471.039" dur="3.201">you couldn&apos;t just migrate away easily</text><text start="472.8" dur="2.16">and so tribal warfare became more</text><text start="474.24" dur="3.359">obligated</text><text start="474.96" dur="4.32">it involved the plow in the beginning of</text><text start="477.599" dur="3.521">real economic surplus there were so</text><text start="479.28" dur="5.28">there were a few different kind of</text><text start="481.12" dur="3.44">um forcing functions</text><text start="485.039" dur="4.16">but we&apos;re talking about what size should</text><text start="487.039" dur="2.481">it be right what size should a society</text><text start="489.199" dur="3.28">be</text><text start="489.52" dur="4.079">and i think the idea like if we think</text><text start="492.479" dur="3.361">about your body for</text><text start="493.599" dur="4.32">a moment as a self-organizing complex</text><text start="495.84" dur="4.32">system that is multi-scaled</text><text start="497.919" dur="4.641">we think about bodies of wonderland our</text><text start="500.16" dur="6.159">body is a wonderland yeah</text><text start="502.56" dur="4.639">uh you have that&apos;s a john mayer song i</text><text start="506.319" dur="3.361">apologize</text><text start="507.199" dur="4.0">but yes so uh if you think about our our</text><text start="509.68" dur="2.239">body and the billions of cells that are</text><text start="511.199" dur="3.041">in it</text><text start="511.919" dur="4.401">well you don&apos;t have like think about how</text><text start="514.24" dur="4.239">ridiculous it would be to try to have</text><text start="516.32" dur="4.8">all the tens of trillions of cells in it</text><text start="518.479" dur="5.761">with no internal organization structure</text><text start="521.12" dur="4.24">right just like a sea of protoplasm your</text><text start="524.24" dur="4.56">democracy</text><text start="525.36" dur="5.68">and so you have cells and tissues</text><text start="528.8" dur="3.92">and then you have tissues and organs and</text><text start="531.04" dur="3.12">organs and organ systems and so you have</text><text start="532.72" dur="3.52">these layers of organization</text><text start="534.16" dur="3.359">and then obviously the individual and a</text><text start="536.24" dur="5.44">tribe in a</text><text start="537.519" dur="5.681">ecosystem and each of the higher layers</text><text start="541.68" dur="3.2">are both based on the lower layers but</text><text start="543.2" dur="4.079">also influencing them</text><text start="544.88" dur="4.16">i think the future of civilization will</text><text start="547.279" dur="3.041">be similar which is there&apos;s a level of</text><text start="549.04" dur="2.08">governance that happens at the level of</text><text start="550.32" dur="3.92">the individual</text><text start="551.12" dur="4.719">my own governance of my own choice</text><text start="554.24" dur="3.039">i think there&apos;s a level that happens at</text><text start="555.839" dur="3.041">the level of a family</text><text start="557.279" dur="2.961">we&apos;re making decisions together we&apos;re</text><text start="558.88" dur="2.24">inter-influencing each other and</text><text start="560.24" dur="1.68">affecting each other taking</text><text start="561.12" dur="3.68">responsibility</text><text start="561.92" dur="4.32">for the idea of an extended family and</text><text start="564.8" dur="3.12">you can see that like for a lot of human</text><text start="566.24" dur="3.44">history we had an extended family we had</text><text start="567.92" dur="2.64">a local community a local church or</text><text start="569.68" dur="3.36">whatever it was</text><text start="570.56" dur="4.279">we had these intermediate structures</text><text start="573.04" dur="3.84">whereas right now this kind of like the</text><text start="574.839" dur="5.081">individual</text><text start="576.88" dur="5.28">producer consumer taxpayer voter and the</text><text start="579.92" dur="3.599">massive nation state global complex</text><text start="582.16" dur="3.04">and not that much in the way of</text><text start="583.519" dur="2.88">intermediate structures that we relate</text><text start="585.2" dur="2.8">with and not that much in the way of</text><text start="586.399" dur="5.921">real personal dynamics all</text><text start="588.0" dur="7.519">impersonalized made fungible and</text><text start="592.32" dur="5.92">so i think that we have to have</text><text start="595.519" dur="4.32">global governance meaning i think we</text><text start="598.24" dur="2.8">have to have governance at the scale we</text><text start="599.839" dur="3.041">affect stuff and if</text><text start="601.04" dur="3.359">if anybody is messing up the oceans that</text><text start="602.88" dur="3.36">matters for everybody so that</text><text start="604.399" dur="3.201">that can&apos;t only be national or only</text><text start="606.24" dur="2.88">local</text><text start="607.6" dur="3.04">everyone is scared of the idea of global</text><text start="609.12" dur="3.68">governance because we think about some</text><text start="610.64" dur="4.16">top-down system of imposition that now</text><text start="612.8" dur="3.52">has no checks and balances on power i&apos;m</text><text start="614.8" dur="2.56">scared of that same version so i&apos;m not</text><text start="616.32" dur="3.199">talking about that kind of global</text><text start="617.36" dur="3.52">governance</text><text start="619.519" dur="3.041">it&apos;s why i&apos;m even using the word</text><text start="620.88" dur="3.84">governance as a process rather than</text><text start="622.56" dur="5.44">government as an imposed</text><text start="624.72" dur="4.799">uh phenomena and so i think we have to</text><text start="628.0" dur="3.2">have global governance but i think we</text><text start="629.519" dur="3.201">also have to have local governance and</text><text start="631.2" dur="3.84">there has to be relationships between</text><text start="632.72" dur="3.92">them that each</text><text start="635.04" dur="3.52">where there are both checks and balances</text><text start="636.64" dur="4.0">and power flows of information</text><text start="638.56" dur="3.76">so i think governance at the level of</text><text start="640.64" dur="4.0">cities will be a bigger</text><text start="642.32" dur="3.84">deal in the future than governance at</text><text start="644.64" dur="2.08">the level of nation states because i</text><text start="646.16" dur="3.04">think</text><text start="646.72" dur="3.2">nation states are largely fictitious</text><text start="649.2" dur="3.44">things</text><text start="649.92" dur="4.4">that are defined by wars and agreements</text><text start="652.64" dur="2.639">to stop wars and like that i think</text><text start="654.32" dur="2.32">cities are</text><text start="655.279" dur="2.881">based on real things that will keep</text><text start="656.64" dur="3.439">being real where the proximity of</text><text start="658.16" dur="3.28">certain things together</text><text start="660.079" dur="3.2">the physical proximity of things</text><text start="661.44" dur="2.72">together gives increased value of those</text><text start="663.279" dur="2.881">things</text><text start="664.16" dur="4.32">so you look at like jeffrey west&apos;s work</text><text start="666.16" dur="4.32">on scale and finding that</text><text start="668.48" dur="3.68">companies and nation states and things</text><text start="670.48" dur="3.28">that have a kind of complicated</text><text start="672.16" dur="2.4">agreement structure get diminishing</text><text start="673.76" dur="2.96">return</text><text start="674.56" dur="3.76">of you of production per capita as the</text><text start="676.72" dur="3.04">total number of people increases beyond</text><text start="678.32" dur="3.28">about the tribal scale but the city</text><text start="679.76" dur="2.72">actually gets increasing productivity</text><text start="681.6" dur="2.64">per capita</text><text start="682.48" dur="3.28">but it&apos;s not designed it&apos;s kind of this</text><text start="684.24" dur="3.279">organic thing right</text><text start="685.76" dur="3.28">so there should be governance at the</text><text start="687.519" dur="3.281">level of cities because people can</text><text start="689.04" dur="4.08">sense and actually have some agency</text><text start="690.8" dur="3.92">there probably neighborhoods and smaller</text><text start="693.12" dur="3.12">scales within it and also verticals</text><text start="694.72" dur="2.96">and some of it won&apos;t be geographic it&apos;ll</text><text start="696.24" dur="2.24">be network-based right networks of</text><text start="697.68" dur="2.64">affinities</text><text start="698.48" dur="4.72">so i don&apos;t think the future is one type</text><text start="700.32" dur="5.04">of governance now what we can say</text><text start="703.2" dur="3.6">more broadly is say when we&apos;re talking</text><text start="705.36" dur="2.08">about groups of people that inter-affect</text><text start="706.8" dur="2.56">each other</text><text start="707.44" dur="3.44">the idea of a civilization is that we</text><text start="709.36" dur="3.12">can figure out how to coordinate our</text><text start="710.88" dur="3.36">choice making</text><text start="712.48" dur="4.32">to not be at war with each other and</text><text start="714.24" dur="4.0">hopefully increase total</text><text start="716.8" dur="3.36">productive capacity that&apos;s good for</text><text start="718.24" dur="3.839">everybody division of labor and</text><text start="720.16" dur="4.64">specialty so we all get</text><text start="722.079" dur="3.2">more better stuff and whatever but it&apos;s</text><text start="724.8" dur="4.24">a</text><text start="725.279" dur="3.761">it&apos;s a coordination of our choice making</text><text start="729.44" dur="3.6">i think we can look at civilizations</text><text start="731.279" dur="3.761">failing on the side</text><text start="733.04" dur="3.359">of not having enough coordination of</text><text start="735.04" dur="3.039">choice making so they fail on the side</text><text start="736.399" dur="4.0">of chaos and then they cleave and an</text><text start="738.079" dur="5.681">internal war comes about or whatever</text><text start="740.399" dur="6.0">or they can&apos;t make smart decisions and</text><text start="743.76" dur="5.759">they overuse their resources or whatever</text><text start="746.399" dur="5.361">or it can fail on the side of trying to</text><text start="749.519" dur="4.641">get order</text><text start="751.76" dur="4.0">via imposition via force and so it fails</text><text start="754.16" dur="4.72">on the side of oppression which ends up</text><text start="755.76" dur="5.36">being for a while functional</text><text start="758.88" dur="4.24">ish for the thing as a whole but</text><text start="761.12" dur="2.56">miserable for most people in it until it</text><text start="763.12" dur="2.32">fails</text><text start="763.68" dur="3.279">either because of revolt or because it</text><text start="765.44" dur="2.32">can&apos;t innovate enough or something like</text><text start="766.959" dur="2.241">that</text><text start="767.76" dur="3.12">and so there&apos;s this like toggling</text><text start="769.2" dur="4.879">between a</text><text start="770.88" dur="3.759">order via oppression and chaos and i</text><text start="774.079" dur="3.521">think the</text><text start="774.639" dur="4.64">idea of democracy not the way we&apos;ve</text><text start="777.6" dur="2.799">implemented it but the idea of it</text><text start="779.279" dur="3.041">whether we&apos;re talking about</text><text start="780.399" dur="4.801">a representative democracy or a direct</text><text start="782.32" dur="4.88">digital democracy liquid democracy</text><text start="785.2" dur="4.879">republic or whatever the idea of an open</text><text start="787.2" dur="5.759">society participatory governance</text><text start="790.079" dur="4.481">is can we have order that is emergent</text><text start="792.959" dur="4.88">rather than imposed</text><text start="794.56" dur="5.76">so that we aren&apos;t stuck with chaos and</text><text start="797.839" dur="5.281">infighting and inability to coordinate</text><text start="800.32" dur="6.4">and we&apos;re also not stuck with oppression</text><text start="803.12" dur="5.04">and what would it take to have emergent</text><text start="806.72" dur="3.04">order</text><text start="808.16" dur="3.52">this is the most kind of central</text><text start="809.76" dur="5.68">question for me these days</text><text start="811.68" dur="5.36">because if</text><text start="815.44" dur="3.04">we look at what different nation states</text><text start="817.04" dur="3.28">are doing around the world and we see</text><text start="818.48" dur="5.12">nation states that are more</text><text start="820.32" dur="4.319">authoritarian that in some ways are</text><text start="823.6" dur="2.479">actually coordinating much more</text><text start="824.639" dur="5.601">effectively</text><text start="826.079" dur="6.0">so for instance we can see that</text><text start="830.24" dur="3.599">china has built high-speed rail not just</text><text start="832.079" dur="3.44">through its country but around the world</text><text start="833.839" dur="4.0">and the us hasn&apos;t built any high-speed</text><text start="835.519" dur="4.081">rail yet you can see that it brought 300</text><text start="837.839" dur="2.401">million people out of poverty in a time</text><text start="839.6" dur="2.96">where</text><text start="840.24" dur="3.279">we&apos;ve had increasing economic inequality</text><text start="842.56" dur="4.0">happening</text><text start="843.519" dur="4.401">you can see like that</text><text start="846.56" dur="2.88">if there was a single country that could</text><text start="847.92" dur="2.88">make all of its own stuff if the global</text><text start="849.44" dur="3.199">supply chains failed</text><text start="850.8" dur="3.52">china would be the closest one to being</text><text start="852.639" dur="4.88">able to start to go closed</text><text start="854.32" dur="3.759">loop on fundamental things uh belt and</text><text start="857.519" dur="4.0">road</text><text start="858.079" dur="4.241">initiative supply chain on rare earth</text><text start="861.519" dur="2.641">metals</text><text start="862.32" dur="3.68">transistor manufacturing that was like</text><text start="864.16" dur="4.239">oh they&apos;re actually coordinating more</text><text start="866.0" dur="6.639">effectively in some important ways</text><text start="868.399" dur="8.56">in the last call it 30 years and</text><text start="872.639" dur="7.521">that&apos;s imposed order in post order and</text><text start="876.959" dur="7.281">we can see that if in the u.s</text><text start="880.16" dur="6.0">if no let&apos;s look at why real quick</text><text start="884.24" dur="3.44">we know why we created term limits so</text><text start="886.16" dur="3.119">that we wouldn&apos;t have</text><text start="887.68" dur="3.04">forever monarchs that&apos;s the thing we</text><text start="889.279" dur="2.961">were trying to get away from and that</text><text start="890.72" dur="3.28">there would be checks and balances on</text><text start="892.24" dur="4.08">power and that kind of thing</text><text start="894.0" dur="3.92">but that also has created a negative</text><text start="896.32" dur="3.12">second order effect which is nobody does</text><text start="897.92" dur="3.279">long-term planning</text><text start="899.44" dur="3.28">because somebody comes in who&apos;s got four</text><text start="901.199" dur="2.721">years they want re-elected</text><text start="902.72" dur="3.04">they don&apos;t do anything that doesn&apos;t</text><text start="903.92" dur="2.96">create a return within four years they</text><text start="905.76" dur="4.079">will end up getting them</text><text start="906.88" dur="4.319">elected re-elected and so the 30-year</text><text start="909.839" dur="2.961">industrial development to build</text><text start="911.199" dur="3.281">high-speed trains or</text><text start="912.8" dur="3.279">the new kind of fusion energy or</text><text start="914.48" dur="2.24">whatever it is just doesn&apos;t get invested</text><text start="916.079" dur="4.081">in</text><text start="916.72" dur="5.28">and then if you have left versus right</text><text start="920.16" dur="3.2">where whatever someone does for four</text><text start="922.0" dur="3.279">years then the other guy gets in and</text><text start="923.36" dur="3.52">undoes it for four years</text><text start="925.279" dur="2.961">and most of the energy goes into</text><text start="926.88" dur="3.6">campaigning against each other this</text><text start="928.24" dur="4.08">system is just dissipating as heat</text><text start="930.48" dur="3.44">right like it&apos;s just burning up as heat</text><text start="932.32" dur="3.28">and the system that has no term limits</text><text start="933.92" dur="2.32">and no internal friction in fighting</text><text start="935.6" dur="2.56">because they</text><text start="936.24" dur="3.279">got rid of those people can actually</text><text start="938.16" dur="5.84">coordinate better</text><text start="939.519" dur="5.521">but uh i would argue it has its own fail</text><text start="944.0" dur="3.36">states eventually</text><text start="945.04" dur="3.44">and dystopic properties that are not the</text><text start="947.36" dur="3.52">thing we want</text><text start="948.48" dur="3.359">so the goal is to accomplish to create a</text><text start="950.88" dur="3.44">system that does</text><text start="951.839" dur="4.161">long-term planning without the negative</text><text start="954.32" dur="4.24">effects of a monarch</text><text start="956.0" dur="5.12">or dictator that stays there for the</text><text start="958.56" dur="2.56">long term</text><text start="961.44" dur="2.319">and</text><text start="964.639" dur="7.2">accomplish that through uh not doing</text><text start="968.0" dur="7.92">the imposition of a single leader</text><text start="971.839" dur="7.44">but through uh emergent so that doesn&apos;t</text><text start="975.92" dur="4.8">that perhaps first of all the technology</text><text start="979.279" dur="3.761">in itself seems to me</text><text start="980.72" dur="3.84">maybe disagree allow for different</text><text start="983.04" dur="4.0">possibilities here</text><text start="984.56" dur="3.44">which is uh make primary the system not</text><text start="987.04" dur="6.32">the humans</text><text start="988.0" dur="9.12">so the the the basic uh the medium</text><text start="993.36" dur="7.919">on which the democracy happens like</text><text start="997.12" dur="7.6">like a platform or where people can uh</text><text start="1001.279" dur="7.12">make decisions do the choice making</text><text start="1004.72" dur="3.679">the coordination of the choice making</text><text start="1008.56" dur="3.839">where emerges some kind of order to</text><text start="1010.8" dur="2.719">where like something that applies at the</text><text start="1012.399" dur="4.24">scale of the family</text><text start="1013.519" dur="6.56">the extent family the city</text><text start="1016.639" dur="4.481">the the country the the
