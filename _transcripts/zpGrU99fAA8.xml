heavy</text><text start="10.61" dur="3.39">meat diet and loved animals and didn&apos;t</text><text start="12.65" dur="3.9">recognize those were incongruent and</text><text start="14.0" dur="4.109">then I saw a slaughter truck and I saw</text><text start="16.55" dur="3.96">animals in the most terrible conditions</text><text start="18.109" dur="4.771">and it was really horrifying for me I</text><text start="20.51" dur="3.6">was 9 ask my parents about it and they</text><text start="22.88" dur="3.18">said that&apos;s where hamburgers came from</text><text start="24.11" dur="3.6">and that was the beginning of my animal</text><text start="26.06" dur="6.449">rights journey in the last time I ate</text><text start="27.71" dur="6.45">meat and I found John Robbins book diet</text><text start="32.509" dur="4.081">for a new America and got into it and</text><text start="34.16" dur="4.319">got into pitas working but I still ate</text><text start="36.59" dur="3.539">dairy and eggs for some years wasn&apos;t oz</text><text start="38.479" dur="3.211">15 that I became vegan because in my</text><text start="40.129" dur="7.62">mind was like well I&apos;m not hurting the</text><text start="41.69" dur="7.5">animal right and but not right there&apos;s a</text><text start="47.749" dur="4.83">couple things that are important to note</text><text start="49.19" dur="6.0">here on the dairy topic first if we look</text><text start="52.579" dur="4.5">at factory farms all animals and factory</text><text start="55.19" dur="3.629">farms whether we&apos;re consuming their body</text><text start="57.079" dur="3.0">or byproducts from their body are seen</text><text start="58.819" dur="3.45">as a commodity where we&apos;re trying to</text><text start="60.079" dur="3.9">maximize the output of the sellable</text><text start="62.269" dur="3.241">commodity for the least amount of money</text><text start="63.979" dur="4.801">in which means the least amount of care</text><text start="65.51" dur="4.8">space etc and there&apos;s just really</text><text start="68.78" dur="3.06">grotesque cruelty throughout the whole</text><text start="70.31" dur="3.99">process if you want to have a look at</text><text start="71.84" dur="3.84">what dairy cows lives are like the</text><text start="74.3" dur="3.84">hormones that they&apos;re pumped full of to</text><text start="75.68" dur="4.23">produce extra milk the way their babies</text><text start="78.14" dur="5.13">are taken from them early I mean on and</text><text start="79.91" dur="5.76">on have YouTube videos on what the life</text><text start="83.27" dur="4.17">of industrial dairy looks like it&apos;s</text><text start="85.67" dur="3.84">nothing like the small farms that people</text><text start="87.44" dur="5.88">imagine but then let&apos;s even go to that</text><text start="89.51" dur="5.73">small farm model rate here&apos;s the</text><text start="93.32" dur="4.85">fundamental challenge with dairy even if</text><text start="95.24" dur="6.57">it&apos;s done as well as it can be done is</text><text start="98.17" dur="5.65">in order for a cow to be producing milk</text><text start="101.81" dur="4.08">it has to have a baby and the milk is</text><text start="103.82" dur="3.42">intended for the baby if the baby gets</text><text start="105.89" dur="3.57">to drink the milk and we aren&apos;t getting</text><text start="107.24" dur="4.89">the commodity from it that we can sell</text><text start="109.46" dur="6.3">and yet we still have to pay for the</text><text start="112.13" dur="5.1">feed to support that cow and so we take</text><text start="115.76" dur="3.0">the cows with a goat or whatever it is</text><text start="117.23" dur="3.69">away from the mom either at the very</text><text start="118.76" dur="4.17">beginning or prematurely and they get</text><text start="120.92" dur="4.08">raised on formula so that we can get the</text><text start="122.93" dur="3.63">milk and that&apos;s all of all of the</text><text start="125.0" dur="3.269">developmental problems for the baby cow</text><text start="126.56" dur="4.25">all the emotional issues you know that</text><text start="128.269" dur="5.851">would develop between the two of them</text><text start="130.81" dur="5.11">that&apos;s a fundamental unavoidable kind of</text><text start="134.12" dur="2.97">ethics issue right there and then the</text><text start="135.92" dur="2.49">second thing is that half of those</text><text start="137.09" dur="3.9">babies are going to be male cow</text><text start="138.41" dur="4.38">and that means that even if this is a</text><text start="140.99" dur="3.18">dairy where the female cows could grow</text><text start="142.79" dur="2.85">up and become part of this dairy the</text><text start="144.17" dur="3.06">male cows can&apos;t be part of this dairy</text><text start="145.64" dur="4.38">and again there&apos;s a cost to support</text><text start="147.23" dur="4.44">their life and that cost can&apos;t be</text><text start="150.02" dur="3.21">justified if there&apos;s no return on</text><text start="151.67" dur="2.67">investment there so they all get sold to</text><text start="153.23" dur="2.16">slaughter whether they&apos;re slaughtered</text><text start="154.34" dur="2.49">they&apos;re slaughtered somewhere else so</text><text start="155.39" dur="3.93">there really is no dairy without</text><text start="156.83" dur="5.1">slaughter right the fact that the milk</text><text start="159.32" dur="3.87">requires babies and that the babies you</text><text start="161.93" dur="3.15">know half are going to be male</text><text start="163.19" dur="4.08">guarantees slaughtered in the process in</text><text start="165.08" dur="3.45">the modern industrial version most of</text><text start="167.27" dur="4.29">that looks like veal and some of the</text><text start="168.53" dur="5.72">most terrible kinds of animal cruelty</text><text start="171.56" dur="5.94">but even in the kindest versions of it</text><text start="174.25" dur="7.63">slaughter is intimately tied with it and</text><text start="177.5" dur="7.89">so I don&apos;t see any way to do dairy that</text><text start="181.88" dur="5.13">doesn&apos;t support things that again have</text><text start="185.39" dur="3.27">that same fundamental ethic of you have</text><text start="187.01" dur="4.01">to make their life matter so much less</text><text start="188.66" dur="6.93">for something relatively trivial for us</text><text start="191.02" dur="7.48">when we look at eggs again commercial</text><text start="195.59" dur="4.32">egg farming is as atrocious as every</text><text start="198.5" dur="4.5">other form of commercial animal</text><text start="199.91" dur="5.01">husbandry but let&apos;s imagine that we&apos;re</text><text start="203.0" dur="3.9">talking about a local little farm and</text><text start="204.92" dur="5.04">first I do want to state that if</text><text start="206.9" dur="4.41">something says farm-fresh eggs or cage</text><text start="209.96" dur="3.33">free eggs that doesn&apos;t mean that it&apos;s</text><text start="211.31" dur="3.27">not industrial farming you can have cage</text><text start="213.29" dur="3.15">free meaning they&apos;re not in battery</text><text start="214.58" dur="5.22">cages but they&apos;re still packed into the</text><text start="216.44" dur="5.52">tiniest environment you know etc so if</text><text start="219.8" dur="3.66">you&apos;re thinking that you&apos;re doing eggs</text><text start="221.96" dur="3.0">that come from a healthy little farm</text><text start="223.46" dur="4.53">you&apos;ve really got to double-check what</text><text start="224.96" dur="4.95">the sourcing on that is if someone is in</text><text start="227.99" dur="3.33">the graduation process of eating less</text><text start="229.91" dur="3.15">animal products they&apos;re kind of having a</text><text start="231.32" dur="3.27">wake up on that and yet they don&apos;t feel</text><text start="233.06" dur="3.42">totally ready for whatever reason is</text><text start="234.59" dur="3.78">nutrition or otherwise to be a hundred</text><text start="236.48" dur="5.64">percent vegan yet eggs are the thing</text><text start="238.37" dur="5.58">that I would I would be happiest with</text><text start="242.12" dur="5.13">them to eat you know as a transitional</text><text start="243.95" dur="8.55">food eggs from a local small sustainable</text><text start="247.25" dur="7.55">kind of farm and here&apos;s kind of the</text><text start="252.5" dur="4.91">whole breakdown with regard to that if</text><text start="254.8" dur="4.42">chickens or whatever animal you&apos;re</text><text start="257.41" dur="3.13">getting eggs from but most commonly</text><text start="259.22" dur="2.55">chickens if they&apos;re allowed to have a</text><text start="260.54" dur="3.72">natural life where we&apos;re not</text><text start="261.77" dur="4.5">constraining it too much then they&apos;re</text><text start="264.26" dur="3.33">gonna be mating and those are all gonna</text><text start="266.27" dur="2.94">be fertilized and they&apos;re gonna want to</text><text start="267.59" dur="4.29">protect those eggs to not get away from</text><text start="269.21" dur="4.68">them you&apos;re gonna be taking animals too</text><text start="271.88" dur="3.54">you know would otherwise taking eggs</text><text start="273.89" dur="3.83">that would become animals otherwise and</text><text start="275.42" dur="6.63">so there&apos;s the ethic kill thing in that</text><text start="277.72" dur="6.61">and that&apos;s you know that&apos;s a an ethical</text><text start="282.05" dur="6.33">problem on the same kind of order as the</text><text start="284.33" dur="5.25">previous ones if you keep the rooster</text><text start="288.38" dur="4.56">away from the chickens then it&apos;s</text><text start="289.58" dur="5.82">unfertilized eggs and there&apos;s not a huge</text><text start="292.94" dur="3.87">kind of ethical harm to it intrinsically</text><text start="295.4" dur="4.89">but I&apos;ll tell you where kind of the</text><text start="296.81" dur="7.14">boundary issues are here we have to</text><text start="300.29" dur="5.37">constrain that animal&apos;s life where we</text><text start="303.95" dur="4.71">don&apos;t ever give it the opportunity to</text><text start="305.66" dur="5.19">mate or to interact in what would really</text><text start="308.66" dur="3.39">be a natural way for it and even if</text><text start="310.85" dur="3.3">we&apos;re doing that and what looks like a</text><text start="312.05" dur="4.35">pretty kind environment we still ask</text><text start="314.15" dur="3.87">that that would I trade places with them</text><text start="316.4" dur="3.39">kind of thing if you were kept in an</text><text start="318.02" dur="3.39">environment that where you were fed and</text><text start="319.79" dur="3.15">you were well taken care of but you were</text><text start="321.41" dur="3.21">never allowed around the opposite gender</text><text start="322.94" dur="3.54">allowed to mate like you wouldn&apos;t</text><text start="324.62" dur="4.14">consider that a good deal it would be a</text><text start="326.48" dur="4.32">better deal than a torturous one and so</text><text start="328.76" dur="4.8">anytime we relate with animals where we</text><text start="330.8" dur="4.29">are modifying what their nature is to</text><text start="333.56" dur="3.2">make them fulfill a purpose for us</text><text start="335.09" dur="4.77">there&apos;s ethical questions that come up</text><text start="336.76" dur="4.53">and honestly these even extend them to</text><text start="339.86" dur="4.38">how we relate to what we call pets</text><text start="341.29" dur="4.75">horses dogs cats when you start to get</text><text start="344.24" dur="3.51">into issues like hey if they keep</text><text start="346.04" dur="3.36">breeding and we&apos;re killing in shelters</text><text start="347.75" dur="2.79">this is a real problem but neutering</text><text start="349.4" dur="3.3">would you want to be in a position where</text><text start="350.54" dur="3.78">that had to happen and these are really</text><text start="352.7" dur="3.87">the boundary zone questions right these</text><text start="354.32" dur="3.84">are well hey is that animal getting some</text><text start="356.57" dur="3.03">enhancement in its life experience</text><text start="358.16" dur="3.09">because of us or because it&apos;s been so</text><text start="359.6" dur="3.03">domesticated and hybridized that it</text><text start="361.25" dur="2.43">couldn&apos;t live in nature anymore it&apos;s</text><text start="362.63" dur="2.52">just now just something we have to deal</text><text start="363.68" dur="3.87">with and I&apos;m gonna say these are things</text><text start="365.15" dur="4.5">to just feel into but the bottom line</text><text start="367.55" dur="4.68">here is that if you commodify an animal</text><text start="369.65" dur="5.91">where the animal or its byproducts</text><text start="372.23" dur="4.95">becomes a commodity for us then you are</text><text start="375.56" dur="4.77">going to constrain the way that it lives</text><text start="377.18" dur="4.68">alter it in ways that it doesn&apos;t like</text><text start="380.33" dur="2.82">that you wouldn&apos;t like to trade places</text><text start="381.86" dur="3.36">with and there are going to be some</text><text start="383.15" dur="3.99">ethical considerations around that so</text><text start="385.22" dur="3.93">you know this is why I choose veganism</text><text start="387.14" dur="4.08">don&apos;t need eggs if I was going to eat</text><text start="389.15" dur="3.75">some animal product it would be eggs and</text><text start="391.22" dur="4.56">I&apos;d be really cautious about where they</text><text start="392.9" dur="4.59">came from and I think one point on this</text><text start="395.78" dur="4.65">that&apos;s worth noting is that when someone</text><text start="397.49" dur="5.34">says you know what for me the ethics of</text><text start="400.43" dur="3.75">eating an egg from a small farm like I</text><text start="402.83" dur="5.4">can live with that</text><text start="404.18" dur="5.82">it&apos;s important to then hold from a small</text><text start="408.23" dur="3.51">farm and not just say oh I eat eggs</text><text start="410.0" dur="2.76">because there&apos;s one way of doing it</text><text start="411.74" dur="2.43">that&apos;s okay so that means when I&apos;m out</text><text start="412.76" dur="3.9">in the restaurant I well even though in</text><text start="414.17" dur="5.7">a restaurant it&apos;s coming from you know a</text><text start="416.66" dur="5.94">battery cage or even if you say you know</text><text start="419.87" dur="4.14">what I could hunt I&apos;m okay with that but</text><text start="422.6" dur="3.03">I&apos;m really not okay with factory farms</text><text start="424.01" dur="3.09">and really own what that means when you</text><text start="425.63" dur="3.69">go to a restaurant or a friend&apos;s house</text><text start="427.1" dur="3.84">right and what your supply and demand</text><text start="429.32" dur="3.21">means and that to where if you&apos;re gonna</text><text start="430.94" dur="3.12">draw lines that aren&apos;t all the way at</text><text start="432.53" dur="4.02">veganism make sure you really hold to</text><text start="434.06" dur="4.65">your own ethical lines what about eating</text><text start="436.55" dur="4.2">honey I think that honey is an animal</text><text start="438.71" dur="3.45">by-product that&apos;s the easiest for people</text><text start="440.75" dur="3.21">that don&apos;t eat animal products for</text><text start="442.16" dur="5.67">ethical reasons to still continue to eat</text><text start="443.96" dur="6.54">because of all the issues with these in</text><text start="447.83" dur="5.79">terms of Calm Colony Collapse and their</text><text start="450.5" dur="5.88">inability to survive currently with GMOs</text><text start="453.62" dur="4.89">and pesticides why is it still important</text><text start="456.38" dur="7.02">for people to consider how and when they</text><text start="458.51" dur="6.36">eat honey you know I think with honey</text><text start="463.4" dur="4.26">there&apos;s a few reasons why some people</text><text start="464.87" dur="4.77">might think of it differently one is the</text><text start="467.66" dur="4.05">more different another creature is than</text><text start="469.64" dur="3.63">us the harder it is for us to extend our</text><text start="471.71" dur="3.33">empathy because the harder it is for us</text><text start="473.27" dur="5.27">to recognize that it might experience</text><text start="475.04" dur="5.64">anything like we experienced and so</text><text start="478.54" dur="5.14">empathy is a process of progressive</text><text start="480.68" dur="5.07">widening to be able to recognize our</text><text start="483.68" dur="3.99">interconnectedness and our sameness with</text><text start="485.75" dur="5.43">more things right so extending all the</text><text start="487.67" dur="5.61">way down to insects insects don&apos;t</text><text start="491.18" dur="3.57">necessarily elicit the same emotional</text><text start="493.28" dur="3.69">responses and most people that mammals</text><text start="494.75" dur="4.23">do but it also doesn&apos;t mean that their</text><text start="496.97" dur="4.26">life doesn&apos;t matter and obviously we</text><text start="498.98" dur="4.11">know that for the pollinators our life</text><text start="501.23" dur="4.14">depends on their life continuing in</text><text start="503.09" dur="6.65">terms of maintaining the ecosystem and</text><text start="505.37" dur="4.37">plant life with regard to honey</text><text start="509.84" dur="5.05">the way that we relate to the bees and</text><text start="513.479" dur="2.791">the way that we relate to their hive and</text><text start="514.89" dur="3.389">the way that we gather the honey is what</text><text start="516.27" dur="5.43">really determines the ethics of it in my</text><text start="518.279" dur="6.151">eyes because I don&apos;t have an ethic</text><text start="521.7" dur="4.5">around not interacting with animal</text><text start="524.43" dur="5.07">products I mean if an animal died of</text><text start="526.2" dur="5.31">natural causes and if someone wanted to</text><text start="529.5" dur="4.2">eat it at no ethical issue whether it&apos;s</text><text start="531.51" dur="4.35">a good idea or good for them or not no</text><text start="533.7" dur="5.49">suffering was caused for doing that I</text><text start="535.86" dur="6.74">have an ethic around causing unnecessary</text><text start="539.19" dur="6.47">harm right and so in the process of</text><text start="542.6" dur="5.62">creating honey very often times there&apos;s</text><text start="545.66" dur="6.4">the animal the the bees are commodified</text><text start="548.22" dur="6.6">in a way where the colony is damaged</text><text start="552.06" dur="4.08">bees are killed there&apos;s no real respect</text><text start="554.82" dur="2.85">for their life process and that&apos;s</text><text start="556.14" dur="4.35">through how the antibiotics are pumped</text><text start="557.67" dur="4.59">into them it&apos;s through the process of</text><text start="560.49" dur="3.719">smoking them out to get them to move</text><text start="562.26" dur="4.55">from one hive to gather the honey but</text><text start="564.209" dur="5.611">there are beekeeping practices that</text><text start="566.81" dur="4.18">recognize that bees are surplus creators</text><text start="569.82" dur="2.73">they&apos;re one of the few things in nature</text><text start="570.99" dur="2.64">that creates surplus and that even if</text><text start="572.55" dur="2.279">they have more honey than they&apos;re gonna</text><text start="573.63" dur="2.85">use for a long time they just keep doing</text><text start="574.829" dur="2.82">it that&apos;s what they do and that we can</text><text start="576.48" dur="2.88">take from that surplus without really</text><text start="577.649" dur="3.871">bothering their life without harming</text><text start="579.36" dur="3.27">them if that&apos;s the beekeeping practice I</text><text start="581.52" dur="4.62">have no problem with it</text><text start="582.63" dur="5.459">and if that&apos;s really supports people to</text><text start="586.14" dur="4.11">support bees</text><text start="588.089" dur="5.341">it happens me that those practices also</text><text start="590.25" dur="5.55">go along with what will help bees resist</text><text start="593.43" dur="3.899">colony collapse disorder much of the</text><text start="595.8" dur="3.99">colony collapse disorder has to do a</text><text start="597.329" dur="4.171">very hybridized species of bees that</text><text start="599.79" dur="4.38">have less robust immune systems because</text><text start="601.5"
