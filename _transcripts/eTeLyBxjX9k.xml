on</text><text start="3.57" dur="4.019">you to say hey people can&apos;t pay</text><text start="5.879" dur="3.451">attention more than sound bites you got</text><text start="7.589" dur="3.121">to make it 5-minute junks the the word</text><text start="9.33" dur="4.679">size is too big make it for an eighth</text><text start="10.71" dur="3.9">grade level right which is saying people</text><text start="14.009" dur="3.541">are dumb</text><text start="14.61" dur="5.19">so spoon feed them stuff that dumb</text><text start="17.55" dur="3.389">people can handle which to the degree</text><text start="19.8" dur="4.95">you do that and it&apos;s successful will</text><text start="20.939" dur="6.5">keep people dumb but that&apos;s what that&apos;s</text><text start="24.75" dur="5.849">what like those are the pressures in in</text><text start="27.439" dur="6.911">anyone doing broadcast even for a</text><text start="30.599" dur="6.031">hopefully good intention right and if we</text><text start="34.35" dur="6.99">want people to actually be able to make</text><text start="36.63" dur="7.679">sense of the world well you can&apos;t do it</text><text start="41.34" dur="6.39">in very short periods of time with lots</text><text start="44.309" dur="6.27">of distraction and oversimplified like</text><text start="47.73" dur="4.86">if you if you look at anyone who</text><text start="50.579" dur="4.021">actually increased the sense making</text><text start="52.59" dur="4.05">capacity of the world you look at any</text><text start="54.6" dur="5.7">scientist or philosopher they didn&apos;t do</text><text start="56.64" dur="6.599">it in tweets and they didn&apos;t do it</text><text start="60.3" dur="6.62">radically distracted and they didn&apos;t do</text><text start="63.239" dur="8.011">it in a dumb down process right like I</text><text start="66.92" dur="8.14">have I have so many people who have</text><text start="71.25" dur="6.93">written to me saying like we want to</text><text start="75.06" dur="4.949">create a new kind of education young</text><text start="78.18" dur="6.96">people we want to create a new kind of</text><text start="80.009" dur="7.25">education that makes everybody like</text><text start="85.14" dur="4.29">Bucky fuller or Leonardo&apos;s that</text><text start="87.259" dur="3.311">conditions polymaths</text><text start="89.43" dur="4.95">and they say this because I&apos;ve written</text><text start="90.57" dur="5.43">some stuff on that topic and that they</text><text start="94.38" dur="5.58">have some sense that they could lead</text><text start="96.0" dur="9.06">that and I&apos;m like have you read Bucky&apos;s</text><text start="99.96" dur="9.299">books like well no we mostly don&apos;t read</text><text start="105.06" dur="5.97">books and have you read the references</text><text start="109.259" dur="3.811">in Bucky&apos;s books just see the amount of</text><text start="111.03" dur="4.229"> that he read and referenced to make</text><text start="113.07" dur="4.2">sense of things well and so there&apos;s a</text><text start="115.259" dur="4.5">there there&apos;s a decoupling</text><text start="117.27" dur="3.9">of the sense of the agency possible with</text><text start="119.759" dur="3.54">what it takes to do it it&apos;s you know</text><text start="121.17" dur="5.28">like that there&apos;s a saying everywhere in</text><text start="123.299" dur="4.621">almost all domains to this effect of</text><text start="126.45" dur="2.97">like everybody wants to be buff but</text><text start="127.92" dur="3.24">nobody wants to lift heavy weights or</text><text start="129.42" dur="3.79">everybody wants to win and nobody wants</text><text start="131.16" dur="7.93">to work harder there&apos;s something like</text><text start="133.21" dur="7.95">that happens here is if I want to be</text><text start="139.09" dur="5.73">able to make sense of the world well I</text><text start="141.16" dur="4.68">have to work at that and if I want to be</text><text start="144.82" dur="3.0">able to make sense of the world better</text><text start="145.84" dur="8.66">that the world better than I currently</text><text start="147.82" dur="9.26">do like attention requires being trained</text><text start="154.5" dur="4.96">just like muscles require being trained</text><text start="157.08" dur="6.49">thinking clearly requires being trained</text><text start="159.46" dur="5.7">and anytime there&apos;s a hormetic process</text><text start="163.57" dur="3.39">you know hormesis is the principle by</text><text start="165.16" dur="4.23">which you stress an adaptive system to</text><text start="166.96" dur="4.14">increase its adaptive capacity so I have</text><text start="169.39" dur="3.39">to stress a muscle to get the muscle to</text><text start="171.1" dur="4.46">grow if I&apos;m lifting an amount of weight</text><text start="172.78" dur="5.07">that&apos;s super easy the muscle there&apos;s no</text><text start="175.56" dur="3.37">input that says the muscle needs to be</text><text start="177.85" dur="2.91">bigger and there&apos;s a cost to getting</text><text start="178.93" dur="3.54">bigger right so it&apos;s only gonna go</text><text start="180.76" dur="4.02">through that cost if it&apos;s being stressed</text><text start="182.47" dur="4.2">and the same is true like if I expose</text><text start="184.78" dur="3.57">myself to more heat and more cold than</text><text start="186.67" dur="3.48">as comfortable actually gain greater</text><text start="188.35" dur="3.18">metabolic flexibility to deal with heat</text><text start="190.15" dur="3.03">and cold which means that if I stay in</text><text start="191.53" dur="2.64">an environment where I always have</text><text start="193.18" dur="3.0">heating and air conditioning I&apos;ll</text><text start="194.17" dur="3.48">actually lose metabolic flexibility you</text><text start="196.18" dur="3.27">have to stress the system to be able to</text><text start="197.65" dur="3.0">grow the system and in a particular kind</text><text start="199.45" dur="2.64">of way not all stressors are going to</text><text start="200.65" dur="4.71">grow the system but this is definitely</text><text start="202.09" dur="6.0">true cognitively which means if I keep</text><text start="205.36" dur="8.34">paying attention to hyper normal stimuli</text><text start="208.09" dur="9.78">that are moving quickly so I get the</text><text start="213.7" dur="7.47">stimuli of lots of novelty I&apos;m gonna be</text><text start="217.87" dur="5.61">decreasing my attention but if I want to</text><text start="221.17" dur="4.35">have any kind of nuanced view I have to</text><text start="223.48" dur="5.1">be able to hold multiple partial views</text><text start="225.52" dur="4.44">in working memory it&apos;s not that some</text><text start="228.58" dur="2.52">people have good memory or good</text><text start="229.96" dur="3.21">attention and other people don&apos;t</text><text start="231.1" dur="3.24">intrinsically it any more than some</text><text start="233.17" dur="3.15">people are buff and some aren&apos;t</text><text start="234.34" dur="8.16">intrinsically it&apos;s developable but it</text><text start="236.32" dur="7.89">has to actually be developed so so the</text><text start="242.5" dur="3.33">impulse to say hey make it really simple</text><text start="244.21" dur="3.15">so everybody can get it and the impulse</text><text start="245.83" dur="4.52">to say help people actually make sense</text><text start="247.36" dur="5.3">of the world well or different things</text><text start="250.35" dur="4.6">now some people will make stuff</text><text start="252.66" dur="5.35">technical seeming intentionally to</text><text start="254.95" dur="5.4">obscure it as a power game right so that</text><text start="258.01" dur="4.95">to encourage others to defer their sense</text><text start="260.35" dur="3.45">making to them I understand this complex</text><text start="262.96" dur="1.38"> you&apos;re not going to be able to</text><text start="263.8" dur="5.79">understand this</text><text start="264.34" dur="8.34">defer authority to me we will we want to</text><text start="269.59" dur="6.299">do something if we actually want to</text><text start="272.68" dur="6.39">empower people I don&apos;t want them to</text><text start="275.889" dur="5.041">defer their sense-making to me but I</text><text start="279.07" dur="2.55">also don&apos;t want them to do lazy shitty</text><text start="280.93" dur="3.54">sense-making</text><text start="281.62" dur="4.56">or defer it to anyone else which means I</text><text start="284.47" dur="3.99">want them to grow the quality of their</text><text start="286.18" dur="5.4">own sense making which means to grow the</text><text start="288.46" dur="4.86">depth of their care right anti nihilism</text><text start="291.58" dur="4.04">to grow the depth of their care to grow</text><text start="293.32" dur="4.5">the depth of their earnestness their own</text><text start="295.62" dur="4.21">self-reflexiveness to pay attention to</text><text start="297.82" dur="3.659">their biases and where their sloppiness</text><text start="299.83" dur="2.58">and thinking their own skills and</text><text start="301.479" dur="3.391">capacity want them to grow their</text><text start="302.41" dur="3.9">attention span and both the clarity of</text><text start="304.87" dur="3.06">their logic and the clarity of their</text><text start="306.31" dur="2.94">intuition and the noticing when</text><text start="307.93" dur="3.12">something&apos;s coming from intuition or</text><text start="309.25" dur="3.33">logic and how to relate those like all</text><text start="311.05" dur="2.9">of those things but that&apos;s
