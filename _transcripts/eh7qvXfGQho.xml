a</text><text start="5.91" dur="4.229">property that&apos;s actually essential to</text><text start="8.519" dur="1.95">understand the nature of the universe we</text><text start="10.139" dur="2.13">live in</text><text start="10.469" dur="3.561">and it&apos;s actually essential to</text><text start="12.269" dur="4.711">understand what it means to be human and</text><text start="14.03" dur="5.499">that is essential for understanding the</text><text start="16.98" dur="5.19">basis for meaning for ethics for</text><text start="19.529" dur="3.51">existentialism and then also what that</text><text start="22.17" dur="3.59">portends</text><text start="23.039" dur="4.5">for the future of civilization and</text><text start="25.76" dur="4.15">addressing some of the things that are</text><text start="27.539" dur="5.191">concerning and that are exciting okay so</text><text start="29.91" dur="4.169">you can consider the next 20 minutes or</text><text start="32.73" dur="5.19">however long this is as kind of an</text><text start="34.079" dur="6.841">extemporaneous rambling ode to emergence</text><text start="37.92" dur="4.979">itself right a kind of love talk about</text><text start="40.92" dur="3.959">how cool it is that universe actually</text><text start="42.899" dur="5.061">has this property and that we can</text><text start="44.879" dur="6.211">understand and participate within so</text><text start="47.96" dur="5.65">let&apos;s start by defining what is</text><text start="51.09" dur="4.14">emergence emergence means something new</text><text start="53.61" dur="3.0">arises that wasn&apos;t here before</text><text start="55.23" dur="3.809">all right we all kind of have that sense</text><text start="56.61" dur="4.71">intuitively but scientifically how the</text><text start="59.039" dur="4.801"> does that happen how do you bring</text><text start="61.32" dur="4.5">particles or planets or anything</text><text start="63.84" dur="3.599">together and all of a sudden the hole</text><text start="65.82" dur="3.44">has some properties that none of the</text><text start="67.439" dur="6.331">parts had like where do they come from</text><text start="69.26" dur="6.67">which is why in in the fields of science</text><text start="73.77" dur="4.02">that steady emergence which evolutionary</text><text start="75.93" dur="3.509">theory and biology and system science</text><text start="77.79" dur="3.99">and complexity theory study it it&apos;s</text><text start="79.439" dur="4.381">considered the closest thing to magic</text><text start="81.78" dur="4.379">that&apos;s actually a scientifically kind of</text><text start="83.82" dur="3.72">admissible term but it&apos;s still sketchy</text><text start="86.159" dur="3.801">right in terms of the really</text><text start="87.54" dur="5.46">understanding how this thing works and</text><text start="89.96" dur="6.22">because how do we get fundamentally new</text><text start="93.0" dur="5.4">things out of relationships of things</text><text start="96.18" dur="4.59">where that didn&apos;t exist before this is</text><text start="98.4" dur="6.539">this fascinating how do you have a cell</text><text start="100.77" dur="9.9">that respirate s-- made up of molecules</text><text start="104.939" dur="6.901">none of whom respirate and so it&apos;s just</text><text start="110.67" dur="3.57">really interesting when you actually</text><text start="111.84" dur="4.23">think about this right we we have a coin</text><text start="114.24" dur="3.9">a paired term does anyone know what the</text><text start="116.07" dur="6.119">term is that is key and understanding</text><text start="118.14" dur="6.15">synergy in emergence is synergy synergy</text><text start="122.189" dur="4.171">and emergence are two sides of the same</text><text start="124.29" dur="3.03">phenomena synergy means whole that&apos;s</text><text start="126.36" dur="3.45">greater than the sum of its parts</text><text start="127.32" dur="4.05">emergence is what is that greater it is</text><text start="129.81" dur="3.39">what is the new stuff that emerges out</text><text start="131.37" dur="3.63">of bringing things together</text><text start="133.2" dur="5.46">and so synergies more formally defined</text><text start="135.0" dur="5.16">as properties of whole systems that</text><text start="138.66" dur="3.24">aren&apos;t found in any of the parts taken</text><text start="140.16" dur="3.93">separately which also means that are</text><text start="141.9" dur="4.559">fundamentally unpredicted by the parts</text><text start="144.09" dur="4.16">taken separately which portends a future</text><text start="146.459" dur="3.541">that is fundamentally ontologically</text><text start="148.25" dur="4.12">unpredictable from the current state of</text><text start="150.0" dur="4.5">the future which is very different than</text><text start="152.37" dur="4.17">a mechanistic clock unfolding Newtonian</text><text start="154.5" dur="3.72">understanding of the future and yet</text><text start="156.54" dur="3.33">still actually makes sense in terms of</text><text start="158.22" dur="3.829">scientific laws super interesting right</text><text start="159.87" dur="4.649">so synergy is this property of</text><text start="162.049" dur="5.821">relationship where the whole has new</text><text start="164.519" dur="6.451">properties that the parts didn&apos;t have so</text><text start="167.87" dur="5.77">emergence is a result of synergy synergy</text><text start="170.97" dur="6.239">as a result of relationship that makes</text><text start="173.64" dur="6.99">sense and relationship is a result of</text><text start="177.209" dur="4.53">attractive forces there are some kinds</text><text start="180.63" dur="2.669">of attractive forces whether it&apos;s</text><text

it&apos;s electromagnetism</text><text start="186.84" dur="3.78">bringing subatomic particles together</text><text start="188.73" dur="4.53">into atoms or the strong force bringing</text><text start="190.62" dur="4.679">quarks together into protons each of</text><text start="193.26" dur="4.17">those are emergent properties driven by</text><text start="195.299" dur="3.601">synergy driven by relationship driven by</text><text start="197.43" dur="4.44">attraction or whether it&apos;s bringing</text><text start="198.9" dur="5.55">these people together via pheromones or</text><text

world</text><text start="206.549" dur="5.94">there&apos;s some attractive forces and so</text><text start="209.13" dur="5.579">Bucky fuller called love metaphysical</text><text start="212.489" dur="4.411">gravity in the same way that gravity and</text><text start="214.709" dur="4.201">physical forces act on physical bodies</text><text start="216.9" dur="3.989">to attract them we have medical physical</text><text start="218.91" dur="5.43">forces that act on metaphysical bodies</text><text start="220.889" dur="4.951">to drive attraction but think about so</text><text start="224.34" dur="3.899">imagine if you think about all of the</text><text start="225.84" dur="4.5">attractive forces as expressions of a</text><text start="228.239" dur="4.411">fundamental principle of universe of</text><text start="230.34" dur="4.709">allurement that there is a principle by</text><text start="232.65" dur="4.739">which separate things have reason to</text><text start="235.049" dur="4.861">come together that offers advantage that</text><text start="237.389" dur="4.141">being separate doesn&apos;t have and you</text><text start="239.91" dur="4.139">think about all of the forces as special</text><text start="241.53" dur="4.62">case applications of that imagine if</text><text start="244.049" dur="3.78">that wasn&apos;t the case imagine if we had a</text><text

start="267.06" dur="3.3">story why at the heart of the</text><text start="268.59" dur="4.23">evolutionary story is this love story</text><text start="270.36" dur="4.26">which is that it&apos;s actually a traction</text><text start="272.82" dur="4.47">driving the whole evolutionary</text><text start="274.62" dur="4.799">story right attraction driving</text><text start="277.29"

this set of phenomena together does</text><text start="290.28" dur="6.48">that make sense so then evolution in</text><text start="294.41" dur="5.259">complexity theory is defined most</text><text start="296.76" dur="4.65">generally in terms of more elegantly</text><text start="299.669" dur="3.961">ordered complexity that&apos;s actually the</text><text start="301.41" dur="3.9">best definition we have in terms of</text><text start="303.63" dur="4.17">mathematical complexity theory coming</text><text start="305.31" dur="3.84">out of Santa Fe Institute the definition</text><text start="307.8" dur="2.85">has the word elegance built right in it</text><text start="309.15" dur="3.78">because it&apos;s again one of these actually</text><text start="310.65" dur="4.56">fairly mysterious properties but it&apos;s</text><text start="312.93" dur="3.51">key to it which is bringing things</text><text start="315.21" dur="4.019">together doesn&apos;t give you emergent</text><text start="316.44" dur="5.1">properties bringing them together in a</text><text start="319.229" dur="4.5">particularly elegantly ordered way does</text><text start="321.54" dur="4.14">so think about think about all the parts</text><text start="323.729" dur="5.631">that make up a cell right you&apos;ve got all</text><text start="325.68" dur="6.93">these nonliving parts DNA and cell</text><text start="329.36" dur="5.02">nucleus structures and all the different</text><text start="332.61" dur="5.01">organelles and cytoplasm and they&apos;re all</text><text start="334.38" dur="4.92">not living and then the cell is living</text><text start="337.62" dur="3.18">but if you brought all those parts</text><text start="339.3" dur="3.06">together but you didn&apos;t arrange them as</text><text start="340.8" dur="2.97">a cell it was just a bunch of molecules</text><text start="342.36" dur="3.96">it wouldn&apos;t be that interesting right</text><text start="343.77" dur="4.17">just be Goo if you took the 50 trillion</text><text start="346.32" dur="3.09">cells that made you and you didn&apos;t</text><text start="347.94" dur="4.95">arrange them exactly this way and you</text><text start="349.41" dur="5.19">just had like 150 pounds worth of cells</text><text start="352.89" dur="2.58">it would be much less interesting even</text><text start="354.6" dur="2.819">though there&apos;d be just as much</text><text start="355.47" dur="3.33">complexity you wouldn&apos;t have an order in</text><text start="357.419" dur="2.791">the complexity where the emergent</text><text start="358.8" dur="4.38">property comes that&apos;s actually the</text><text start="360.21" dur="4.35">relationship it&apos;s not just heaps coming</text><text start="363.18" dur="2.97">together it&apos;s not just complexity it&apos;s</text><text start="364.56" dur="4.02">wholes and the difference between a hole</text><text start="366.15" dur="4.44">and a heap is order and a specific set</text><text start="368.58" dur="6.45">of patterns of order this means not</text><text start="370.59" dur="7.47">every relationship is synergistic some</text><text start="375.03" dur="5.4">relationships are entropic they actually</text><text start="378.06" dur="3.84">create the opposite direction of new</text><text start="380.43" dur="4.01">emergent properties they destroy some</text><text start="381.9" dur="7.25">properties that were already there right</text><text start="384.44" dur="4.71">almost everyone has some examples</text><text start="389.889" dur="5.11">but you bring chemicals together that</text><text start="392.27" dur="5.1">rather than self-organizing to create</text><text start="394.999" dur="4.021">higher ordered molecules with new</text><text start="397.37" dur="3.449">thermodynamic properties they have an</text><text start="399.02" dur="3.419">exothermic entropic reaction and they</text><text start="400.819" dur="5.07">drop to lower levels of organization</text><text start="402.439" dur="5.22">right this is true at all levels so it&apos;s</text><text start="405.889" dur="3.571">not just relationship it&apos;s specific</text><text start="407.659" dur="4.171">kinds of relationship that maximize</text><text start="409.46" dur="4.069">synergy this is a key thing to</text><text start="411.83" dur="4.019">understand about the nature of universe</text><text start="413.529" dur="4.36">it&apos;s also the case that if you bring the</text><text start="415.849" dur="3.391">same thing together a bunch of the same</text><text start="417.889" dur="3.3">thing you don&apos;t get very interesting</text><text start="419.24" dur="2.88">synergies you get very interesting</text><text start="421.189" dur="2.16">synergies when you bring different</text><text start="422.12" dur="3.569">things with different properties</text><text start="423.349" dur="3.81">together in the right format where then</text><text start="425.689" dur="2.82">you have the properties of each of those</text><text start="427.159" dur="2.88">things and then the properties of the</text><text start="428.509" dur="3.451">relationship between those which is the</text><text start="430.039" dur="4.891">new stuff and you get emergent so you&apos;ve</text><text start="431.96" dur="4.049">got hydrogen and you&apos;ve got oxygen which</text><text start="434.93" dur="2.4">are different things and you bring them</text><text start="436.009" dur="3.451">together and you get water in the basis</text><text start="437.33" dur="5.449">for life but neither hydrogen or oxygen</text><text start="439.46" dur="6.0">at room temperature or liquids right and</text><text start="442.779" dur="5.2">so this is a fascinating thing so we&apos;re</text><text start="445.46" dur="4.5">actually very interested in having deep</text><text start="447.979" dur="5.94">synergistic relationships with</text><text start="449.96" dur="7.379">differences that lead to fundamentally</text><text start="453.919" dur="5.851">new emerging properties so it&apos;s not just</text><text start="457.339" dur="4.05">net complexity it&apos;s ordered complexity</text><text start="459.77" dur="3.06">and it&apos;s elegantly ordered complexity</text><text start="461.389" dur="3.631">and then when you get a new property</text><text start="462.83" dur="3.649">then universe selects for that right</text><text start="465.02" dur="3.899">that new property offers some</text><text start="466.479" dur="4.21">evolutionary advantage to that system</text><text start="468.919" dur="3.81">that a system that didn&apos;t have that</text><text start="470.689" dur="3.48">wouldn&apos;t have so things can come</text><text start="472.729" dur="2.94">together all kinds of ways but the ones</text><text start="474.169" dur="3.661">that come together most synergistically</text><text start="475.669" dur="3.72">offer and confer the most advantage in</text><text start="477.83" dur="4.979">Universal exports so universe is</text><text start="479.389" dur="5.58">actually selecting for more differences</text><text start="482.809" dur="5.22">right so it&apos;s selecting for diversity</text><text start="484.969" dur="5.25">and then more synergistic combinations</text><text start="488.029" dur="4.711">across those differences that and it&apos;s</text><text start="490.219" dur="4.53">both of those more diversity and more</text><text start="492.74" dur="4.709">unification across the diversity right</text><text start="494.749" dur="5.31">more agency and more symbiosis at the</text><text start="497.449" dur="7.131">same time is what defines the arrow of</text><text start="500.059" dur="4.521">evolution does that make sense</text><text start="505.59" dur="6.91">things that are separate autonomous</text><text start="508.81" dur="5.76">agents right so like a cell you can</text><text start="512.5" dur="3.959">think of as having its own agency right</text><text start="514.57" dur="3.899">its own ability to act and its own</text><text start="516.459" dur="4.14">boundary and periphery but you bring a</text><text start="518.469" dur="4.081">bunch of cells together and this</text><text start="520.599" dur="4.141">collection of cells can reflect on</text><text start="522.55" dur="3.99">consciousness and existentialism and</text><text start="524.74" dur="3.27">have a conversation like this even</text><text start="526.54" dur="5.01">though none of those cells on their own</text><text start="528.01" dur="5.04">do that right and it&apos;s different kinds</text><text start="531.55" dur="4.02">of cells you couldn&apos;t do that with just</text><text start="533.05" dur="4.89">neurons it takes neurons and glial cells</text><text start="535.57" dur="5.28">and immune cells and stem cells etc to</text><text start="537.94" dur="4.95">all come together so more agency more</text><text start="540.85" dur="4.049">differentiation more orderly</text><text start="542.89" dur="3.81">relationship more synergy all of that</text><text start="544.899" dur="4.68">comes together and the net defining</text><text start="546.7" dur="5.49">thing is emergence how much fundamental</text><text start="549.579" dur="5.791">new advantage arises and that&apos;s what</text><text start="552.19" dur="4.62">evolution selects for and so if it</text><text start="555.37" dur="3.18">wasn&apos;t for this whole combination of</text><text start="556.81" dur="7.709">things together is this the message that</text><text start="558.55" dur="9.99">says five minutes left fascinating so so</text><text start="564.519" dur="5.551">I I&apos;ll see if we can go very quickly</text><text start="568.54" dur="5.88">through that was the first 1% of what I</text><text start="570.07" dur="6.15">hoped to discuss so I&apos;m going to just</text><text start="574.42" dur="5.46">skim over the top of a bunch of topics</text><text start="576.22" dur="8.6">and hopefully paint a distorted least of</text><text start="579.88" dur="7.5">an arc that&apos;s interesting so the</text><text start="584.82" dur="4.09">evolutionary universe story the kind of</text><text start="587.38" dur="3.18">noobest story of universe we have</text><text start="588.91" dur="3.419">emerging from the intersection of all</text><text start="590.56" dur="2.91">the

the</text><text start="613.959" dur="4.711">physical you also have the evolution of</text><text start="616.899" dur="3.511">consciousness structures themselves</text><text start="618.67" dur="3.779">right as you move from a reptilian</text><text start="620.41" dur="3.48">nervous system to the increased orderly</text><text start="622.449" dur="3.51">complexity of the mammalian and then a</text><text start="623.89" dur="3.96">neocortical and then prefrontal nervous</text><text start="625.959" dur="3.661">system you move from the kinds of</text><text start="627.85"

then</text><text start="1046.48" dur="3.03">when you get that everyone else if they</text><text start="1047.92" dur="3.75">don&apos;t self actualize universe is less</text><text start="1049.51"

just foreshadow quickly if</text><text start="1116.679" dur="5.011">we cherry pick from the huge data sets</text><text start="1119.95" dur="3.96">about where Humanity is going right now</text><text
