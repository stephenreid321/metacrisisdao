dur="4.5">evolution in in consciousness or the way</text><text start="287.37" dur="4.2">that we operate what you sense is that</text><text start="289.53" dur="6.21">leap that we need to make in terms of</text><text start="291.57" dur="6.09">how we operate you actually have to</text><text start="295.74" dur="3.48">think about it on all of those levels to</text><text start="297.66" dur="3.3">be able to make sense of it in a</text><text start="299.22" dur="3.81">meaningful way otherwise it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="300.96" dur="3.39">like asking when we are talking about</text><text start="303.03" dur="2.7">the health of a person whether that</text><text start="304.35" dur="3.12">means the health of their liver or their</text><text start="305.73" dur="2.73">kidneys or their blood it&apos;s like that</text><text start="307.47" dur="2.52">doesn&apos;t even make sense you can&apos;t</text><text start="308.46" dur="4.22">separate those things from each other so</text><text start="309.99" dur="6.99">when I think about what economics is</text><text start="312.68" dur="6.4">economics is our value system codified</text><text start="316.98" dur="3.57">as value equations that determines how</text><text start="319.08" dur="3.93">much we value one thing relative to</text><text start="320.55" dur="4.08">another thing that determines what we&apos;re</text><text start="323.01" dur="4.41">incentivized to do and what we confer</text><text start="324.63" dur="4.41">power to so if a dead whale is worth a</text><text start="327.42" dur="3.21">million dollars on a fishing boat and a</text><text start="329.04" dur="3.81">live whale in the ocean is worth nothing</text><text start="330.63" dur="3.9">that&apos;s a value system codified in a</text><text start="332.85" dur="3.56">value equation that then incentivizes</text><text start="334.53" dur="3.93">behavior but it also incentivizes</text><text start="336.41" dur="3.97">psychopathology right psychopathy</text><text start="338.46" dur="3.5">actually I have to shut empathy down</text><text start="340.38" dur="3.87">because leaving the whale in the ocean</text><text start="341.96" dur="3.459">it I hope she isn&apos;t even gonna stay in</text><text start="344.25" dur="2.64">the ocean another guy&apos;s got a hunter it</text><text start="345.419" dur="4.021">out right so I&apos;ve got a tragedy of the</text><text start="346.89" dur="3.96">Commons so I have to kind of deaden to</text><text start="349.44" dur="4.47">be able to do the thing that is</text><text start="350.85" dur="4.26">incentivized by the system or somebody</text><text start="353.91" dur="3.96">else does and I&apos;m just not effective in</text><text start="355.11" dur="4.14">the system so you can&apos;t think about the</text><text start="357.87" dur="2.88">evolution of human consciousness in the</text><text start="359.25" dur="2.88">evolution of economics differently but</text><text start="360.75" dur="2.94">if you look at the way economics then</text><text start="362.13" dur="2.46">needs to protect its own profit stream</text><text start="363.69" dur="4.29">in the way it will learn how to</text><text start="364.59" dur="4.56">influence media to control people&apos;s</text><text start="367.98" dur="3.42">sense making frameworks in the way it</text><text start="369.15" dur="3.72">will influence governance again this is</text><text start="371.4" dur="3.48">getting to consciousness or the way it</text><text start="372.87" dur="3.78">will influence legislation on the nature</text><text start="374.88" dur="5.76">of what happens in education to prepare</text><text start="376.65" dur="9.41">people for the workforce and so the</text><text start="380.64" dur="10.26">paradigm shift is basically everything</text><text start="386.06" dur="7.18">we need new systems of governance if we</text><text start="390.9" dur="4.14">just I mean we think about how much we</text><text start="393.24" dur="4.62">love the word democracy and we love the</text><text start="395.04" dur="5.28">word democracy because it&apos;s better than</text><text start="397.86" dur="3.4">tyranny and it&apos;s better than the other</text><text start="400.32" dur="2.26">like really horrible</text><text start="401.26" dur="3.54">systems that we&apos;ve experienced at any</text><text start="402.58" dur="3.93">scale but when Winston Churchill said</text><text start="404.8" dur="3.54">democracy is the single worst form of</text><text start="406.51" dur="3.9">governance ever created save for all the</text><text start="408.34" dur="4.17">other forms what he was saying that was</text><text start="410.41" dur="4.59">really insightful was that getting lots</text><text start="412.51" dur="4.14">of humans to agree on anything is just a</text><text start="415.0" dur="2.94">hard thing to do and we suck at it and</text><text start="416.65" dur="3.21">we&apos;ve never actually done a good job at</text><text start="417.94" dur="4.44">it and this is a really flawed system</text><text start="419.86" dur="3.69">now we like it because like we said it&apos;s</text><text start="422.38" dur="3.57">overcoming things that were even more</text><text start="423.55" dur="3.81">problematic if you think about democracy</text><text start="425.95" dur="3.09">for a moment and whether we&apos;re talking</text><text start="427.36" dur="3.48">representative democracy or liquid</text><text start="429.04" dur="4.14">democracy using a voting currency or</text><text start="430.84" dur="4.83">binary vote fundamentally of a process</text><text start="433.18" dur="4.2">of saying ok we can&apos;t get everybody to</text><text start="435.67" dur="4.35">agree beyond a very small number of</text><text start="437.38" dur="3.63">people Dunbar number tribe you can get</text><text start="440.02" dur="3.0">everybody degree because they can all be</text><text start="441.01" dur="2.91">in a conversation together beyond the</text><text start="443.02" dur="2.79">level of which you can have a</text><text start="443.92" dur="3.3">conversation

start="448.78" dur="3.72">of oligarchy or meritocracy but then</text><text start="451.03" dur="2.94">you&apos;re like no we want most of the</text><text start="452.5" dur="4.47">people to agree at least right that</text><text start="453.97" dur="4.59">seems like a good idea but somebody puts</text><text start="456.97" dur="2.85">forward a proposition to do something</text><text start="458.56" dur="2.73">that they think is important based on</text><text start="459.82" dur="3.93">their limited sense making that is never</text><text start="461.29" dur="4.17">everything that proposition because it</text><text start="463.75" dur="3.51">wasn&apos;t informed by comprehensive sense</text><text start="465.46" dur="3.6">making will always in the process of</text><text start="467.26" dur="4.35">benefiting something also damaged</text><text start="469.06" dur="4.44">something else and so some people love</text><text start="471.61" dur="3.63">that based on if what it&apos;s

dur="5.01">damaging is relevant to them you just</text><text start="478.48" dur="4.83">created inexorable polarization because</text><text start="481.54" dur="3.63">you made shitty propositions and then</text><text start="483.31" dur="3.33">ask people to vote yes or no by an Arri</text><text start="485.17" dur="3.48">on a shitty proposition so you notice</text><text start="486.64" dur="3.36">people actually don&apos;t all get to</text><text start="488.65" dur="3.09">contribute to the sense making of what a</text><text start="490.0" dur="3.69">good proposition would be there&apos;s no</text><text start="491.74" dur="3.48">kind of collective input there there</text><text start="493.69" dur="6.72">isn&apos;t even a generation of what would</text><text start="495.22" dur="7.5">good mean here and they so really even</text><text start="500.41" dur="4.08">their choice making is just yes or no on</text><text start="502.72" dur="4.2">a frame that was already controlled and</text><text start="504.49" dur="4.08">typically who&apos;s going to be able to even</text><text start="506.92" dur="5.04">put forward a proposition as someone who</text><text start="508.57"

dur="4.47">far there are systems of how do we</text><text start="524.31" dur="4.66">individually and collectively make sense</text><text start="526.6" dur="4.59">of what&apos;s going on make sense of what we</text><text start="528.97" dur="5.52">actually value and how those values can</text><text start="531.19" dur="3.75">be synergistically satisfied rather than</text><text start="534.49"
