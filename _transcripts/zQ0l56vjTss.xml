It&apos;s an outstanding pleasure to have you and I&apos;m  </text><text start="12.8" dur="7.44">so looking forward to our conversation today. So 
in order for the people to get to know you better,  </text><text start="21.2" dur="8.56">why don&apos;t you tell us what took you into the 
present moment in your life? what path? what  </text><text start="29.76" dur="7.52">significant emotional and cognitive events 
participated to Daniel Schmachtenberger?</text><text start="40.48" dur="4.72">Oh my goodness, that is 
such an impossible question</text><text start="49.92" dur="3.6">Because there&apos;s so many different 
ways I could answer it so I guess  </text><text start="53.52" dur="7.12">one through-line that is pretty central and is 
relevant to things I think we might discuss today.  </text><text start="62.08" dur="6.4">I was homeschooled by parents that wanted 
to kind of run an educational experiment of  </text><text start="70.0" dur="3.6">letting their kids design their 
own curriculum and this was  </text><text start="73.6" dur="4.24">similar to some of the unschooling ideas 
now but before unschooling was a thing.  </text><text start="79.52" dur="8.4">My parents interests were Buckminster Fuller and 
kind of design science and Fritjof Capra systems  </text><text start="87.92" dur="6.8">science and kind of the philosophy coming 
out of modern physics and world religions  </text><text start="94.72" dur="5.44">and spiritual traditions. And you know the 
best kind of thinking stuff coming out of the  </text><text start="100.16" dur="6.24">hippie movement time period, and so 
obviously as a kid getting to design my  </text><text start="106.4" dur="3.44">own curriculum being exposed to those things made 
a difference because no one&apos;s going to choose to  </text><text start="109.84" dur="7.28">study something they don&apos;t even know exists and 
so it&apos;s nice to have those and so I was studying  </text><text start="117.92" dur="4.08">the sciences and interested in how the 
world works, studying the philosophic  </text><text start="122.0" dur="5.84">traditions around what we&apos;re really here 
for and what is, what is meaningful and</text><text start="131.44" dur="7.04">and then in studying things like uh 
the Bucky Fuller design science work  </text><text start="138.48" dur="6.72">thinking about how do we redesign the 
technological substrate of civilization  </text><text start="145.2" dur="6.4">fundamentally those were kind of early interesting 
questions um and i got into activism very young  </text><text start="152.24" dur="4.08">that was one of the other big areas and it got 
to be home school curriculum time so i got to do  </text><text start="156.32" dur="4.48">a lot more like frontline activism stuff and 
research younger than a lot of people would  </text><text start="161.6" dur="8.16">and it it started with animal rights stuff and 
started with factory farming and then went to  </text><text start="169.76" dur="4.88">whaling and overfishing and species extinction 
and with PETA and Greenpeace and all those types  </text><text start="174.64" dur="9.2">of organizations and that was the beginning of 
kind of existential devastation for me of how much  </text><text start="184.8" dur="5.36">human induced unnecessary suffering and just 
rolling atrocity there is on the planet and then  </text><text start="190.16" dur="4.56">how can i consider my life a success while that&apos;s 
happening like there has to be something wrong  </text><text start="194.72" dur="7.12">with me that i can disconnect from that and just 
be happy to to party and so i remember the very  </text><text start="201.84" dur="4.24">first thing when i was like nine years old that 
i had this feeling around with factory farms was  </text><text start="206.72" dur="6.56">if they still exist when i die then i failed at 
anything worth living for because hey i i can&apos;t  </text><text start="213.28" dur="5.92">have a world that i feel good about where that 
exists the hard part was i kept adding things  </text><text start="219.2" dur="5.44">to that list because you know then start studying 
extreme poverty and then start studying the things  </text><text start="224.64" dur="6.88">that lead to unnecessary wars and then um and this 
was kind of like the centrally torturing thing for  </text><text start="231.52" dur="5.84">me was everybody said that these all are such 
hard issues that nobody&apos;s fixed them and so it  </text><text start="237.36" dur="3.76">would take all of my life focusing on one of them 
maybe have a little bit of a chance and that means  </text><text start="241.12" dur="6.56">ignoring all the other ones and i couldn&apos;t i just 
couldn&apos;t and fortunately the system science focus  </text><text start="247.68" dur="5.04">started to give me a sense that maybe part 
of the problem was focusing on these things  </text><text start="252.72" dur="5.52">in isolation and not what interconnected them and 
the underlying patterns that gave rise to them why  </text><text start="258.24" dur="5.28">do humans make shitty choices why are we not good 
stewards of the technological power that we have  </text><text start="264.88" dur="6.8">and uh you know so there were things that i knew i 
needed to study to be able to even think about it  </text><text start="271.68" dur="6.88">well so i i i went and did university studies and 
studied math and physics and things that i knew  </text><text start="278.56" dur="5.76">would be like important fundamental disciplines 
and philosophy and then independently studying  </text><text start="285.28" dur="6.16">economics and social systems and things like that 
and trying to look at all of the proposed systems  </text><text start="291.44" dur="4.96">for how do we make a better world looking at 
the UN SDG kind of model and looking at the  </text><text start="297.92" dur="5.6">the bildung model can we make the whole world 
like the nordic countries and looking at the uh  </text><text start="303.52" dur="6.96">anarcho-capitalists and libertarian models and 
and it didn&apos;t take that long to see how all of  </text><text start="310.48" dur="5.44">those philosophies catastrophically failed in the 
face of planetary boundaries and exponential tech  </text><text start="316.48" dur="4.16">and that they were just nowhere near deep enough 
thinking for the actual nature of the problems  </text><text start="322.24" dur="5.12">and that was a bummer because i think i hope 
i think i thought originally that there were  </text><text start="327.36" dur="5.92">adequate solutions and i could just find them and 
join them and add energy to it and so it was very  </text><text start="334.24" dur="5.84">devastating for me the first time i went 
and engaged with people at the un to see uh  </text><text start="340.96" dur="4.16">i remember the first conversation i had there 
was with a world food program director where  </text><text start="345.12" dur="4.56">they were looking at a solution to address world 
hunger which was great but their solution involved  </text><text start="349.68" dur="3.2">commercial agriculture going into areas where it 
doesn&apos;t currently exist to be able to feed the  </text><text start="352.88" dur="4.0">people in a way that doesn&apos;t depend upon shipping 
food from other countries which made sense except  </text><text start="356.88" dur="4.8">it was bringing more nitrogen-based fertilizers 
to more river deltas which will increase the  </text><text start="362.4" dur="3.36">rate of dead zones in the ocean which is 
an existential risk for the whole planet  </text><text start="365.76" dur="2.8">when i brought that up to them i&apos;m like 
okay well you&apos;re going to feed more people  </text><text start="368.56" dur="3.68">per year for a few years and then speed 
up the death of the oceans and everybody  </text><text start="373.52" dur="4.0">they&apos;re like yeah we never thought of that and 
that&apos;s a bummer but those are not the metrics  </text><text start="377.52" dur="4.64">we&apos;re tasked with we&apos;re tasked with defeating 
kids metrics i&apos;m like are you [ __ ] kidding me  </text><text start="382.16" dur="5.28">and then i saw that everywhere and i saw that most 
of the work was not only not adequate to succeed  </text><text start="387.44" dur="3.36">but it was causing other problems and other 
areas worse problems because we were defining  </text><text start="390.8" dur="5.84">the problems too narrowly and the world was more 
interconnected than that and so this just led to</text><text start="398.72" dur="5.12">having to continue to step back and say okay 
maybe we just need to do an assessment of the  </text><text start="403.84" dur="5.76">whole problem space well enough to know what 
adequate solutions would take so that was  </text><text start="410.32" dur="4.48">that was kind of the central thrust of my life 
focus and all the various areas of study were what  </text><text start="414.8" dur="5.68">do i need to understand to be able to look at that 
uh so we were mentioning economics obviously we  </text><text start="420.48" dur="5.6">can see that if i have a metric of optimizing GDP 
for a nation or GDP per capita or some metric like  </text><text start="426.08" dur="5.04">that that war is really good uh GDP goes up under 
war if that sick people that spend more money on  </text><text start="431.12" dur="3.52">medicine is good that there&apos;s a lot of perverse 
incentive that addiction is quite profitable  </text><text start="435.28" dur="4.32">and so it&apos;s like okay well that&apos;s a 
dreadful metric and yet we can see that  </text><text start="439.6" dur="6.24">underlying so many of the issues like bad 
medical systems and bad food systems and  </text><text start="446.88" dur="4.8">driving addiction from supply side through 
manufactured demand is a economic system  </text><text start="451.68" dur="4.08">that has perverse incentive writ large and 
there&apos;s something like 70 trillion dollars it  </text><text start="455.76" dur="5.28">trades hands every day and i&apos;m like if we got 70 
trillion dollars of decentralized human incentive  </text><text start="461.84" dur="3.52">almost all of which is causing harm 
along a supply chain of action somewhere</text><text start="468.16" dur="4.72">even if i had a billion dollars a day to spend 
that didn&apos;t even need to make money just pure  </text><text start="472.88" dur="4.48">non-profit and i was maximally effective with 
it and i&apos;m going against 70 trillion dollars a  </text><text start="477.36" dur="4.72">day that is harm externalizing and it&apos;s easier to 
break stuff than it is to fix it or to build it i  </text><text start="482.08" dur="5.84">can i can destroy a house much faster than i can 
build one i&apos;m so many orders of magnitude off of  </text><text start="487.92" dur="5.6">being adequate so i&apos;m like anything that does not 
change perverse incentive is not even worth doing  </text><text start="494.32" dur="4.88">so how do we change 70 trillion dollars a day 
worth of human activity to not have perverse  </text><text start="499.2" dur="3.68">incentive built in well it doesn&apos;t look like 
our current economic system it looks like  </text><text start="502.88" dur="3.84">a fundamentally new economic system so how 
do we how do we make projects that succeed  </text><text start="506.72" dur="3.84">within this economic system and externalize 
a bunch of harm was never interesting to me  </text><text start="511.28" dur="4.4">how do we make a fundamentally how do we make 
an economic system where the success of that  </text><text start="515.68" dur="4.16">economic system and the thriving of life are 
aligned with each other is a different question  </text><text start="521.12" dur="4.96">and uh so yeah then one of the things i saw 
was as i was looking at all these different  </text><text start="526.08" dur="3.44">problems and how they were looking at 
how they were interconnected to see how  </text><text start="529.52" dur="5.6">trying to solve one would move problems somewhere 
else and we&apos;d see that all over the place the you  </text><text start="535.12" dur="4.56">know example that i gave about nitrogen runoff 
is one but we can take pretty much any example  </text><text start="541.44" dur="4.96">and but then also looking at what do all the 
problems have in common as the at the level of  </text><text start="546.4" dur="4.16">generator functions and perverse incentive is one 
example but there&apos;s a number of things that are  </text><text start="550.56" dur="5.76">the underlying system dynamics and by system 
dynamics here we&apos;re not talking like healthcare  </text><text start="556.32" dur="5.92">as a system or or the judicial system as a system 
we&apos;re talking about underneath that the patterns  </text><text start="562.24" dur="8.32">of human behavior what is creating patterns of 
human behavior so i i started forecasting also  </text><text start="570.56" dur="4.16">i was trying to see are these problems are the 
problems getting better are they getting worse  </text><text start="574.72" dur="7.92">and the answer is of course both and so you can 
you can read plenty of books um Pinker and Hans  </text><text start="582.64" dur="6.24">Rosling and all those books on why everything 
is getting better and if you cherry pick the  </text><text start="588.88" dur="6.64">stats and you decontextualize them sure that&apos;s 
true but you read most any environmental metrics  </text><text start="596.24" dur="4.64">not any but so many environmental metrics 
and also catastrophic and existential risk  </text><text start="601.68" dur="3.92">and you can see how many things are getting 
not just worse but precipitously towards  </text><text start="606.96" dur="4.8">the non-viability of civilization worse and 
so when i saw that some things were getting  </text><text start="611.76" dur="3.76">better some things were getting worse i 
saw a phase of civilization destabilizing  </text><text start="616.16" dur="7.2">and that clearly we didn&apos;t just need more of the 
type of actions that we were doing more nonprofit  </text><text start="623.36" dur="6.24">projects more impact investing more UN SDG stuff 
more laws being made and more tech solutions  </text><text start="629.6" dur="5.76">because the whole body of all of that was not 
converging towards adequate because the pro  </text><text start="636.4" dur="4.24">every year we were getting more total catastrophic 
risks and higher probability on each of them  </text><text start="641.36" dur="4.24">when CRISPR comes along we have way more chance 
of all dying from bioweapons with development  </text><text start="645.6" dur="4.16">of AGI we have way more chance of dying from 
AGI-based risks with the development of drones  </text><text start="649.76" dur="3.6">and the weaponization of drones their ability 
to take out infrastructure so it&apos;s like okay the  </text><text start="653.36" dur="6.48">the total probability space of catastrophe is it 
rapidly expanding and if you look at the un world  </text><text start="660.48" dur="4.0">we haven&apos;t solved any of the SDGs they were 
called the millennium development goals before  </text><text start="664.48" dur="5.6">we didn&apos;t solve them the we never succeeded with 
this nuclear d proliferation since the un started  </text><text start="670.08" dur="4.24">we went from two countries with nukes to lots of 
countries with nukes and faster nukes and better  </text><text start="674.32" dur="6.24">nukes we haven&apos;t stopped arms races on a single 
new type of technology we have an arms race on  </text><text start="680.56" dur="6.0">drones we have an arms race on ai we have arms 
race on cyber weapons on bio weapons we haven&apos;t  </text><text start="686.56" dur="4.8">been able to deal with any of the major tragedy 
of the commons like climate change or overfishing  </text><text start="691.36" dur="7.2">so it&apos;s like all right our our problem-solving 
processes writ large are not adequate to the  </text><text start="698.56" dur="7.28">problems we face so we shouldn&apos;t have 17 SDGs 
we should have one superordinate one that is  </text><text start="707.44" dur="4.72">develop the capacity to coordinate 
effectively towards global level issues  </text><text start="713.44" dur="4.32">if we don&apos;t have that we don&apos;t get any of 
the other ones if we do get that we get all  </text><text start="717.76" dur="5.84">the other ones so how do we develop better 
coordination capacities towards global level  </text><text start="724.24" dur="10.16">issues like arms races and tragedy of the commons 
and things like that and uh yeah so that that&apos;s  </text><text start="734.4" dur="4.88">kind of been the through line is seeing all of the 
problems seeing how they&apos;re interconnected seeing  </text><text start="739.28" dur="3.92">what&apos;s underlying and driving them seeing where 
the solutions have some effectiveness but are  </text><text start="743.2" dur="6.0">inadequate and thinking about and working towards 
what what would new problem-solving processes  </text><text start="749.2" dur="3.76">adequate to the problems that we actually 
face look like and how do we bring those about</text><text start="756.0" dur="10.48">brilliant so how do we you mentioned AGI i just 
wanted to explain AGI is artificial general  </text><text start="766.48" dur="5.68">intelligence as an explanation so how do we what 
are the acupuncture points obviously there are  </text><text start="773.36" dur="6.24">enough smart people on this planet to be able 
to develop this whole system thinking and come  </text><text start="779.6" dur="8.0">up with solutions why what makes it so difficult 
for um for such people to come together and come  </text><text start="787.6" dur="5.28">up with solutions and implement them because 
obviously there are many many people who come  </text><text start="793.44" dur="4.32">you know have these solutions but they don&apos;t 
have the political power the influence the  </text><text start="797.76" dur="6.4">money whatever to uh to make them happen so 
what are the fault lines of existing systems  </text><text start="804.72" dur="9.36">and what are the possibilities we have to find 
these acupuncture points and influence them  </text><text start="814.08" dur="5.6">so that we it just to frame me uh let 
me frame this a little bit better you  </text><text start="821.44" dur="4.48">are went on record saying that we&apos;re 
currently facing world war three  </text><text start="827.52" dur="6.8">and uh it&apos;s not kinetic so we don&apos;t really see 
it we don&apos;t really we think it&apos;s peace and it&apos;s  </text><text start="834.32" dur="5.2">wonderful and we all can whatever whatever 
be blessed to buy this and that and the other  </text><text start="840.08" dur="7.2">but in reality we are deep at war with one another 
and we are on our best way toward extinction  </text><text start="847.28" dur="8.0">it&apos;s only a question of time so how do we save 
ourselves it&apos;s just a simple question for you dear</text><text start="858.96" dur="6.88">so everybody knows that the thing we call politics 
and the thing we call war or a gradient of  </text><text start="866.56" dur="5.6">basically rivalrous interests uh 
von Clausewitz famously said war  </text><text start="872.16" dur="6.72">is politics extended by other means and 
but it&apos;s it&apos;s more like the other way it&apos;s  </text><text start="878.88" dur="5.92">more like politics is how we sublimate war 
where we want different things um and yet</text><text start="887.04" dur="6.88">you know diplomatic warfare economic warfare 
cyber warfare narrative and information warfare  </text><text start="893.92" dur="5.68">population central warfare are those politics 
or those well they&apos;re outside of the domain  </text><text start="899.6" dur="6.88">of what we consider the agreed upon political 
process they&apos;re not kinetic warfare world war  </text><text start="906.48" dur="7.04">ii was kind of the end of kinetic warfare being a 
viable solution for the major powers because any  </text><text start="913.52" dur="3.76">weapons that the major powers used against each 
other to really be able to deal with it could  </text><text start="917.28" dur="5.44">escalate and we had weapons now big enough that 
you have a war that nobody wins so after that</text><text start="924.96" dur="4.56">we had to depend on proxy wars which we&apos;ve done 
a lot of we&apos;ve noticed there have been no major  </text><text start="929.52" dur="4.56">superpower wars since world war ii heaps of 
proxy wars well in order to fight a proxy war  </text><text start="934.08" dur="4.56">you again have to base it off propaganda oh they 
have weapons of mass destruction no they don&apos;t  </text><text start="938.64" dur="6.48">but you have to tell that story to be able to go 
invade and do that thing or um and that is a kind  </text><text start="945.12" dur="5.44">of non-kinetic warfare right so we fight proxy 
wars and we fight non-kinetic unconventional wars</text><text start="953.52" dur="7.04">so is it fair to say that the world is in peace 
time right now no i don&apos;t think that&apos;s fair  </text><text start="960.56" dur="5.2">to say i think we can see the total number of 
cyber attacks that are obviously not peacetime  </text><text start="965.76" dur="10.48">we can see the um increase in total numbers of 
catastrophe weapons the first real catastrophe  </text><text start="976.24" dur="4.8">weapon we had was the bomb and before that 
the major empires of the world always fought  </text><text start="981.04" dur="4.88">there were never times where they didn&apos;t fight 
that was how we dealt with our border issues uh  </text><text start="986.88" dur="4.16">world war ii was the beginning of having weapons 
so big that we couldn&apos;t fight as the solution or  </text><text start="991.04" dur="5.04">at least the major powers couldn&apos;t fight and 
so the whole world before world war ii and the  </text><text start="996.08" dur="4.32">world after fundamentally different because before 
that we weren&apos;t powerful enough to ruin everything  </text><text start="1001.52" dur="5.6">and so world war ii is the beginning of 
technologically induced catastrophic risk  </text><text start="1008.08" dur="2.8">so we had to make so we had to be able to 
do something we&apos;d never done which have the  </text><text start="1010.88" dur="4.0">superpowers not war so we had to make an entire 
new world system a globalized world system for  </text><text start="1014.88" dur="5.28">the first time ever and it bought us like 75 years 
of no superpower war there was a cold war there  </text><text start="1020.16" dur="5.92">were proxy wars or other things and that involved 
mutually assured destruction it involved a bunch  </text><text start="1026.08" dur="7.04">of NGOs right the the UN and the world bank and 
IMF and all those types of structures because  </text><text start="1033.12" dur="3.6">we realized that national governments only weren&apos;t 
enough to prevent world war and so we needed these  </text><text start="1036.72" dur="4.88">other things and a whole globalization system 
where we we became so economically interdependent  </text><text start="1041.6" dur="4.0">on each other that we had more incentive to 
do trade with each other than we did to war  </text><text start="1046.32" dur="3.68">and so we can see that the computer that 
we&apos;re talking on today the microphone the  </text><text start="1050.8" dur="5.44">all of it no country in the world can build 
right the from the mining of the materials  </text><text start="1056.24" dur="4.96">to the refinement of them to the hardware to the 
software to the satellite production that is our  </text><text start="1061.2" dur="5.52">internet is communicating over all takes six 
continent supply chains to make well when you  </text><text start="1066.72" dur="3.44">have that much interconnectedness you aren&apos;t 
oriented to blow each other up which is nice  </text><text start="1070.96" dur="4.96">but you get other problems which is you get 
radical fragility so you get a problem in  </text><text start="1075.92" dur="4.0">one area of wuhan and the whole world 
shuts down right and you get catas you  </text><text start="1079.92" dur="6.0">get cascading catastrophic failures you have to 
to stop a virus in a world that connected you  </text><text start="1085.92" dur="5.76">shut down transportation in a way where now you 
realize the flow of fertilizer and pesticides  </text><text start="1092.72" dur="5.52">that now got shut down just drove the poverty 
of the 100 million uh poorest people into much  </text><text start="1098.24" dur="4.0">worse conditions and we had locusts throughout 
northern africa and parts of the middle east  </text><text start="1102.24" dur="4.0">because not having the pesticides you can see 
like all these second and third order effects  </text><text start="1107.2" dur="6.48">also a major part of that world that globalization 
world was we will use industrialization to extract  </text><text start="1113.68" dur="5.36">resources from the earth way faster so that we 
can be so positive gdp that everybody can get  </text><text start="1119.04" dur="5.04">more without taking each other&apos;s stuff and the 
idea there is that if gdp is not high enough  </text><text start="1124.08" dur="3.68">everyone&apos;s desire to have more makes them go zero 
sum and have to take each other&apos;s stuff and so  </text><text start="1127.76" dur="4.64">the answer is there has to keep being more well 
more with a linear materials economy where you&apos;re  </text><text start="1132.4" dur="6.0">taking stuff on renewably and then turning it into 
trash on renewably you can&apos;t run an exponential  </text><text start="1139.52" dur="4.32">linear materials economy on a finite planet for 
all that long and so what we see is that that  </text><text start="1143.84" dur="6.24">Bretton Woods world that kept us from warring for 
like 75 years till now has just come to an end  </text><text start="1151.04" dur="5.04">because we reach planetary boundaries so we can&apos;t 
keep running the linear materials economy that way  </text><text start="1157.2" dur="9.52">we have enough uh fragility in the overall 
system that the types of local collapses that  </text><text start="1166.72" dur="5.04">are inevitable now create global cascading 
collapses and we can&apos;t do mutually assured  </text><text start="1171.76" dur="5.52">destruction anymore because we don&apos;t have one 
catastrophe weapon and two superpowers that have  </text><text start="1177.28" dur="4.56">it we have dozens of catastrophe weapons and many 
many actors including non-state actors including  </text><text start="1181.84" dur="4.0">people we don&apos;t even know who have it well how do 
you do a force Nash equilibrium how do you do a  </text><text start="1186.8" dur="5.52">mutation or destruct you don&apos;t all right so now 
we&apos;re in a new situation there&apos;s the whole world  </text><text start="1192.32" dur="6.4">up to world war ii there&apos;s world war two till 
now there&apos;s a new thing where you could say  </text><text start="1199.84" dur="6.0">that the orienting question that i find 
one of them i find most interesting is</text><text start="1209.52" dur="7.76">around why humans have not been very 
good stewards of power why we have been  </text><text start="1217.28" dur="5.84">shitty stewards of power which both looks 
like war environmental destruction and um  </text><text start="1224.56" dur="3.04">shitty social systems and subjugation and whatever  </text><text start="1228.48" dur="4.48">and we can see that as we&apos;ve gotten more 
technological power those same underlying  </text><text start="1233.6" dur="6.4">issues of not being good stewards of power just 
become bigger deals um and with exponential power  </text><text start="1241.28" dur="3.84">like it&apos;s really important to get that 
the ability to engineer new life forms  </text><text start="1245.76" dur="4.96">to crisp or genetically engineer new life forms 
this is not the power of an apex predator this is  </text><text start="1250.72" dur="5.44">not something that a gorilla or a polar bear or a 
orca can do this is the power of gods the ability  </text><text start="1256.16" dur="5.44">to extinct species at 13 a day the ability to 
destroy whole ecosystems to build totally new  </text><text start="1261.6" dur="4.96">environments the the anthropocene where we are 
the largest force affecting the surface of the  </text><text start="1266.56" dur="5.76">earth more than geology uh the ability to build 
artificial intelligence that has that has the  </text><text start="1272.32" dur="7.52">ability to paperclip maximize the world that this 
is the power of gods that requires something like  </text><text start="1279.84" dur="4.8">the love and wisdom of gods to guide it or it 
blows itself up so while this has always been  </text><text start="1284.64" dur="5.6">an interesting topic of how do we become better 
stewards for our power it is now a critical topic  </text><text start="1290.24" dur="3.68">because rather than just having local wars and 
local environmental destruction which we&apos;ve  </text><text start="1293.92" dur="6.24">had for the last ten thousand years exponential 
warfare blows everything up on a finite planet  </text><text start="1300.16" dur="8.4">exponential externalities in the finite planet 
so exponential tech is a forcing function for us  </text><text start="1308.56" dur="5.12">to become good stewards of the amount of power 
we have or for the human experiment to complete</text><text start="1316.56" dur="4.16">so a way of thinking about it if we take 
exponential tech and the emergence of it  </text><text start="1320.72" dur="4.56">as the center of our inquiry which i 
think is the right way to look at it</text><text start="1328.08" dur="5.28">we take a real politic view and just look at 
what is happening and what is going to happen  </text><text start="1335.28" dur="2.0">just we can say</text><text start="1339.44" dur="6.4">that world war ii was there&apos;s a bunch of other 
ways of looking at it this isn&apos;t the only way  </text><text start="1345.84" dur="5.36">but it&apos;s a useful way world war ii is a 
few competing social ideologies competing  </text><text start="1351.2" dur="5.52">over a chunk of new tech that was all made 
possible by a level of science so you&apos;ve got  </text><text start="1357.68" dur="6.0">communism you&apos;ve got fascism and you&apos;ve got 
capitalism liberal democracies something like  </text><text start="1363.68" dur="7.28">that and basically physical chemistry right atomic 
physics physical chemistry got to a place where  </text><text start="1370.96" dur="5.76">the bomb the v2 rocket the computer and chemistry 
all basically came on board at the same time  </text><text start="1377.92" dur="6.48">and germany was way further ahead than the soviets 
or the us for different reasons and we realized  </text><text start="1384.4" dur="4.0">that was existential and had to catch up and so 
the us did the manhattan project and invested  </text><text start="1388.4" dur="4.32">like crazy which was not market investment that 
was state investment the market did not build  </text><text start="1392.72" dur="5.12">the nuclear bomb right it didn&apos;t figure out 
computation so the idea that markets innovate  </text><text start="1397.84" dur="6.0">and states don&apos;t is utter gibberish because both 
germany and the us and the ussr that developed  </text><text start="1403.84" dur="4.24">all those things the apollo projects sputnik 
et cetera those were all done by states not by  </text><text start="1408.08" dur="5.92">markets and markets have never done anything 
of that scale of development before or after  </text><text start="1415.04" dur="7.76">um so we can see we can think of that as a few 
competing social ideologies for who would get the  </text><text start="1422.8" dur="4.8">new tech because whoever would get the new tech 
would rule the world and we can see that the us  </text><text start="1427.6" dur="4.64">kind of came out ahead so we get a Bretton Woods 
world rather than a soviet contracted world or  </text><text start="1432.24" dur="6.64">whatever else will the tech jump we&apos;re at right 
now the center of it this time is computation  </text><text start="1440.08" dur="4.72">computation gives exponential returns rather 
than multiplicative returns because i can make  </text><text start="1444.8" dur="3.76">a piece of software once and then sell it an 
infinite number of times with no cost of goods  </text><text start="1448.56" dur="4.8">sold and no cost to transport the bits that&apos;s 
very different anything in the domain of atoms  </text><text start="1453.36" dur="4.96">or energy i have cost of goods sold and cost 
to transport the energy of the bits or whatever  </text><text start="1459.36" dur="4.8">so computations at the center and at the very 
center of that is ai and then coming out from  </text><text start="1464.16" dur="4.96">there is the application of ai and computation 
to upgrading the computational substrates  </text><text start="1469.12" dur="5.92">quantum computing photo computing dna computing 
etc other critical computational capacities  </text><text start="1475.04" dur="6.0">crypto type stuff uh and then the application of 
that to things in the domain of atoms and energy  </text><text start="1481.04" dur="6.32">so biotech by being able to apply ai to protein 
folding nanotech because of that material science  </text><text start="1487.36" dur="7.84">is because of that robotics that are run by ai all 
those kinds of things that chunk of tech that is  </text><text start="1495.2" dur="5.2">emerging right now is orders of magnitude more 
significant than the world war ii chunk of tech</text><text start="1502.64" dur="3.92">who only those who are directing 
it will have any say in the future  </text><text start="1508.48" dur="3.6">because it is that much more powerful and 
power has been what determines the future  </text><text start="1513.12" dur="5.52">and this is the real politic assessment 
right now there are only two types of  </text><text start="1518.64" dur="4.88">groups as far as i see it that are 
trying to direct that type of tech</text><text start="1526.24" dur="3.84">authoritarian nation states and corporations</text><text start="1532.72" dur="3.84">so authoritarian nation states china 
is not the only one and i&apos;m not saying  </text><text start="1536.56" dur="3.52">even the china isn&apos;t doing things that are 
quite smart and reasonable of course they are  </text><text start="1541.84" dur="4.88">china&apos;s not leaving the development of its tech 
completely to a market that isn&apos;t aligned with  </text><text start="1546.72" dur="4.48">the long-term plan of its country it has a 
long-term plan for the country it makes sure  </text><text start="1551.2" dur="4.64">that what the market does is aligned with it so 
if a corporation starts to do something that is  </text><text start="1555.84" dur="4.64">too far outside of what would benefit it like the 
ant group started to do they bring it back in line  </text><text start="1561.36" dur="6.0">they have a huge amount of r d themselves as a 
country which so they&apos;re applying ai and attention  </text><text start="1567.36" dur="4.48">technology and iot and robotics and whatever 
to making a better country not just a military  </text><text start="1571.84" dur="7.44">not just a economy but a better nation-state right 
and so this is why they have been able to not only  </text><text start="1580.32" dur="3.52">make high-speed trains within their country but 
export them all around the world and the us hasn&apos;t  </text><text start="1583.84" dur="6.08">built one within its own country this is why they 
have something like 94 percent of the supply chain  </text><text start="1589.92" dur="6.32">on rare earth metals this is why they you 
know have the majority of lithography and um  </text><text start="1596.24" dur="6.24">like really foundational things so we can see that 
uh an authoritarian-style nation-state that can  </text><text start="1603.36" dur="5.12">because they don&apos;t have term limits they don&apos;t 
have a perverse incentive to only do [ __ ] that  </text><text start="1608.48" dur="6.0">will create returns within four years so they get 
re-elected uh so they can do long-term planning  </text><text start="1614.48" dur="4.32">because they don&apos;t have two parties fighting 
against each other they have the ability to  </text><text start="1618.8" dur="3.04">not have all their energy used 
up as internal friction and heat  </text><text start="1621.84" dur="4.0">right so they can actually do fairly decently 
coordinated long-term planning well that&apos;s just  </text><text start="1625.84" dur="5.28">a more effective system this particular point so 
you see that then in the west you see that the  </text><text start="1632.0" dur="3.36">development of the exponential tech is 
mostly not happening by the government  </text><text start="1636.0" dur="4.0">we don&apos;t have to see manhattan project type 
activities we see narrow applications in the  </text><text start="1640.0" dur="3.6">military but the military is not the government 
it&apos;s not how the state tends to the people it&apos;s  </text><text start="1643.6" dur="3.12">not a better system of democracy it&apos;s not a 
better system of educating the people it&apos;s  </text><text start="1646.72" dur="4.24">not a better system of creating a healthy 
economy where people have something like</text><text start="1653.28" dur="6.24">the possibility of upward mobility all of that&apos;s 
left to the market but the market that is doing it  </text><text start="1660.48" dur="6.24">the people who are running it aren&apos;t elected they 
don&apos;t have accountability to the people they don&apos;t  </text><text start="1666.72" dur="4.24">have jurisprudence of these kinds so you can see 
that the companies that are developing the tech  </text><text start="1670.96" dur="4.64">are becoming exponentially more powerful companies 
and they&apos;re becoming so powerful that they&apos;re more  </text><text start="1675.6" dur="3.84">powerful than countries in many ways facebook and 
google have more users than china and the us can  </text><text start="1679.44" dur="4.4">bind up people and they have more data on them 
and they have more behavioral influence over them  </text><text start="1684.4" dur="6.72">that&apos;s [ __ ] powerful right and not only is 
that not strengthening the us outside of gdp even  </text><text start="1691.12" dur="6.56">though they don&apos;t pay taxes proportionately it&apos;s 
destroying the basis of the u.s functioning right  </text><text start="1697.68" dur="6.0">those are running a business model that optimizes 
people&apos;s time on site uses ai to optimize time on  </text><text start="1703.68" dur="4.08">site which happens by appealing to people&apos;s biases 
and in-group identities and all that kind of stuff  </text><text start="1708.32" dur="3.6">which actually polarizes people against each 
other so much that anything like democracy  </text><text start="1711.92" dur="4.32">becomes impossible so we see that exponential 
tech is making exponentially powerful companies  </text><text start="1716.24" dur="7.28">and actually destroying western democracies and 
republics in the process so that converges towards  </text><text start="1723.52" dur="8.88">a new feudalism and so we have basically 
exponential tech has two attractors either  </text><text start="1733.84" dur="5.92">it causes catastrophic risk directly and so you 
just don&apos;t have civilization anymore or you get  </text><text start="1739.76" dur="5.68">shitty civilizations you have two options within 
each of those shitty civilizations look like  </text><text start="1745.44" dur="4.72">authoritarian nation states that are empowered 
with exponential tech or feudalism that&apos;s  </text><text start="1750.16" dur="5.76">empowered with exponential tech the catastrophic 
risks like two kinds exponential externalities  </text><text start="1755.92" dur="5.6">which equals destruction via planetary boundaries 
and environment and stuff uh or exponential  </text><text start="1761.52" dur="4.48">warfare which looks like different things that 
lead to escalation pathways to world war three  </text><text start="1766.0" dur="2.64">so those are the four attractors i 
would say that are out there right now  </text><text start="1769.92" dur="6.48">and they&apos;re all bad they&apos;re all dystopic 
so i&apos;m interested in a new attractor  </text><text start="1777.68" dur="4.08">and given that only those who are directing 
exponential tech will have the power to  </text><text start="1781.76" dur="5.6">have a say in the future but we want to have 
exponential tech not be used dumbly in a way that  </text><text start="1787.36" dur="5.28">causes catastrophic risk but also not create a 
type of civilization that is undesirable for the  </text><text start="1792.64" dur="6.48">majority of the people right that is not aligned 
with uh participatory governance and high civil  </text><text start="1799.12" dur="5.2">liberties and things like that then we get a very 
clear design constraint the design constraint is  </text><text start="1804.32" dur="5.36">that the number one imperative of the world of 
civilization if they are paying any damn attention  </text><text start="1810.48" dur="8.72">needs to be the development the development and 
implementation of the new emerging categories  </text><text start="1819.2" dur="8.0">of exponential technologies to making new social 
technologies to making democracy 2.0 republic 2.0  </text><text start="1827.76" dur="5.76">open societies that are both aligned with 
the kinds of values that we care about  </text><text start="1834.32" dur="4.24">they&apos;ll be different right and they should 
be different the idea that you just vote on  </text><text start="1838.56" dur="3.52">propositions or the propositions you have no 
say in and they&apos;re made by special interest  </text><text start="1842.08" dur="3.84">groups and they&apos;re all bad and if you vote 
yes it benefits one thing and hurt something  </text><text start="1845.92" dur="3.92">else which is why fifty percent vote for it and 
fifty percent don&apos;t it polarizes the population  </text><text start="1850.8" dur="4.08">that&apos;s not democracy voting is not democracy 
democracy is a way that people can participate in  </text><text start="1854.88" dur="5.2">governance that&apos;s a stupid system so will the new 
systems look like just digital voting no they&apos;ll  </text><text start="1860.08" dur="4.48">look like better ways to actually be engaged 
in the crafting of the propositions themselves  </text><text start="1865.12" dur="3.76">so we can come up with better propositions that 
don&apos;t have such unnecessary theory of trade-offs  </text><text start="1869.52" dur="5.84">and so it&apos;s not that we&apos;re trying to make exactly 
the same structure but a digital version we&apos;re  </text><text start="1875.36" dur="6.48">trying to make something that&apos;s aligned with the 
same values of uh both maximizing the integrity of  </text><text start="1881.84" dur="5.92">the commons and maximizing individual freedoms and 
creative expression and like that within that and  </text><text start="1887.76" dur="8.4">so how do we engage exponential technology to make 
new social technologies new open societies that  </text><text start="1896.72" dur="6.16">can preserve the right and advance the 
right types of civil liberties and values  </text><text start="1902.88" dur="4.0">and guide the exponential tech safely so 
that it doesn&apos;t cause catastrophic risk  </text><text start="1908.0" dur="5.68">to me that&apos;s the only imperative worth 
anything because if we don&apos;t do that the  </text><text start="1913.68" dur="4.8">other things won&apos;t matter they won&apos;t end 
up being able to happen so when you asked  </text><text start="1918.48" dur="4.0">how do we go about it that&apos;s an answer at 
a very high level but it&apos;s a starting place</text><text start="1925.28" dur="6.24">brilliant thank you so let me just summarize it 
on you know the last thing that you said i heard  </text><text start="1931.52" dur="5.68">you say that we need to develop a new attractor 
other than the ones that are currently dominating  </text><text start="1938.64" dur="8.16">and your solution or and another alternative is 
what elon musk is doing getting ready to colonize  </text><text start="1946.8" dur="8.24">mars uh because he i don&apos;t think he he hopes 
or believes that we will be able to uh develop  </text><text start="1955.04" dur="5.52">our consciousness to the point where we will be 
able to implement uh the social engineering that  </text><text start="1960.56" dur="8.96">you are just uh if not we will probably export 
the same social failures to that system so the  </text><text start="1969.52" dur="4.16">thing about the mars colony that&apos;s actually 
great it&apos;s not the mars colony itself it&apos;s  </text><text start="1973.68" dur="9.04">the thought experiment why it&apos;s a good thought 
experiment is because import is really hard and so  </text><text start="1983.36" dur="5.68">if i&apos;m trying to build a civilization on mars 
it has to do everything without import and so  </text><text start="1989.68" dur="4.24">if i&apos;m in a bubble where we&apos;re producing our own 
oxygen we&apos;re all stuck in the bubble do i want any  </text><text start="1993.92" dur="5.52">pollution at all for manufacturing none nothing 
nothing how many people can i have in prison  </text><text start="2000.72" dur="3.76">that are breathing oxygen and not doing stuff 
nobody everybody has to be meaningfully engaged  </text><text start="2004.48" dur="3.84">well how do i prevent crime completely and 
have a better process for conflict resolution  </text><text start="2009.12" dur="4.48">we have to do our own biotech in that world a 
gdp maximization is the thing that matters i  </text><text start="2013.6" dur="6.32">don&apos;t want sick people how do i prevent um you 
know health issues so how do we optimize health  </text><text start="2020.56" dur="4.08">uh how do we make sure that all the new stuff 
we need to make we can make from the old stuff  </text><text start="2024.64" dur="5.92">because we can&apos;t get new stuff easily what minimum 
set of tooling do we need to build the rest of the  </text><text start="2030.56" dur="4.4">tools and would we build the text act the same 
way that we did or would we rebuild the text  </text><text start="2034.96" dur="4.24">act differently this is what&apos;s interesting about 
it how would we do law would we import the same  </text><text start="2039.2" dur="3.6">system of law or would we do law fundamentally 
differently would we even have the values that  </text><text start="2042.8" dur="7.12">are the basis of it be rethought through 
so the mars colony is interesting for earth  </text><text start="2051.36" dur="4.0">if we take the thought experiment seriously 
enough that we start thinking about oh wow  </text><text start="2055.36" dur="4.48">we&apos;re powerful enough now that designing 
civilization from scratch is a possible thing  </text><text start="2060.8" dur="2.96">well let&apos;s design this one from scratch 
differently what would that look like</text><text start="2066.56" dur="5.92">so how do we how do we and then you know 
you may want to uh dive into the consistence  </text><text start="2072.48" dur="8.96">project which is your project which i i highly 
i&apos;m fired up about it so how do we begin to  </text><text start="2082.24" dur="6.48">design a new social technology and 
re-engineer society basically what are the  </text><text start="2090.56" dur="7.2">i think the best words or what are the the best 
levers to implement that i mean how do we begin  </text><text start="2097.76" dur="7.2">i i think just like Elon Musk is uh using his idea 
to go to mars as a means to achieve the technology  </text><text start="2104.96" dur="11.6">to shift the mind and technology and everything 
how can we do an earth shot on social engineering</text><text start="2120.8" dur="2.16">and you may want to take a tangent yeah  </text><text start="2124.48" dur="6.0">and just address because you wrote the word term 
social engineering and um that word has a very  </text><text start="2130.48" dur="6.64">negative connotation for many people um in the 
u.s very intensely and so i want to speak to that</text><text start="2143.6" dur="7.36">when we say social engineering a social 
system a society a society or a civilization  </text><text start="2152.88" dur="5.04">we can think about what essentially is 
that it&apos;s a way for a lot of people who  </text><text start="2157.92" dur="5.92">don&apos;t all know each other beyond a tribal 
scale to coordinate their actions usefully</text><text start="2167.12" dur="4.96">that&apos;s kind of fundamentally what it&apos;s about and 
tribal systems before that were different because  </text><text start="2172.08" dur="5.6">there were not that many people and everybody 
knew everybody and but if we now have a place  </text><text start="2177.68" dur="4.24">where i have to compromise my actions in 
some way for people who i don&apos;t even know  </text><text start="2182.8" dur="4.16">and we&apos;re all going to kind of get along well 
and we but how are we all going to get along  </text><text start="2186.96" dur="4.08">well and how are we going to do division of 
labor and specialization and then share the  </text><text start="2191.04" dur="4.56">stuff that we produced in a way that creates more 
kind of wealth and possibility for everybody we  </text><text start="2195.6" dur="5.28">have to have some systems of coordination so i 
think of civilization is coordination systems  </text><text start="2204.8" dur="0.96">civilizations</text><text start="2208.4" dur="5.12">fail either because they can&apos;t bring about 
the order and coordination necessary so  </text><text start="2213.52" dur="6.48">they fail in the direction of chaos or the 
way they bring about the order is imposed  </text><text start="2221.44" dur="3.92">so there&apos;s some okay here&apos;s rule of law and 
we&apos;re going to impose this rule of law by  </text><text start="2225.36" dur="4.72">force and so then it becomes increasingly 
oppressive and then it fails for those reasons  </text><text start="2230.72" dur="6.4">and so civilizations teeter between oppression 
and chaos right so we say how do we get out  </text><text start="2237.12" dur="4.0">of that how do we have something that is not 
oppression and is not chaos well we need order  </text><text start="2241.12" dur="5.2">but we want the order to not be imposed so we need 
order that&apos;s emergent how would we possibly have  </text><text start="2246.32" dur="5.12">emergent order this is the idea of a democracy 
or a republic or an open society of participatory  </text><text start="2251.44" dur="3.92">governance and you notice that they were aligned 
whenever they emerged in the world they were  </text><text start="2255.36" dur="6.88">aligned with some idea of an enlightenment of some 
kind a social enlightenment that had the idea and  </text><text start="2262.24" dur="4.0">if we look at modern democracies emerging 
out of the kind of european enlightenment  </text><text start="2267.76" dur="4.88">the key in the european enlightenment was the 
philosophy of science and the idea that we  </text><text start="2272.64" dur="5.12">could all come to do the same experiment get the 
same result and there was an inherently unifying  </text><text start="2277.76" dur="5.28">property to the nature of objective reality so 
we could make sense of the same world because  </text><text start="2283.04" dur="4.08">what we&apos;re trying to coordinate is the choices 
we make well what&apos;s the basis of our choices  </text><text start="2287.12" dur="4.96">our sense making and our meaning making inform our 
choice making our sense making is what do we think  </text><text start="2292.08" dur="5.04">is going on and what do we think an action would 
be that would move us towards the thing we want  </text><text start="2297.12" dur="4.4">what do we want is our meaning making our values 
generation right so ultimately our ability to  </text><text start="2301.52" dur="5.76">figure out what we value and what&apos;s going on and 
how we think we can advance the values how we do  </text><text start="2307.28" dur="3.52">choice making so the idea that we need to if we 
want to have coordinated choice making we need  </text><text start="2310.8" dur="5.2">to coordinate our sense making can we all come to 
be able to assess reality similarly and we have to  </text><text start="2316.0" dur="5.84">be able to coordinate our values and so can we run 
a Hegelian dialectic right can we run a dialectic  </text><text start="2321.84" dur="4.88">where rather than just say that because it seems 
like you&apos;re optimizing for something else you&apos;re  </text><text start="2326.72" dur="4.4">evil can i try to understand the value that you&apos;re 
trying to optimize for that has some real value so  </text><text start="2332.32" dur="5.36">at first you&apos;re voting for proposition 
a and proposition a is going to as far  </text><text start="2337.68" dur="5.04">as i&apos;m concerned hurt the owls in this area 
so you must just be a non-environmental evil  </text><text start="2342.72" dur="4.48">[ __ ] except i&apos;m like why do you want to do 
that well for the economy what does that mean  </text><text start="2348.32" dur="6.24">well it means that you are actually in a resource 
insecure situation and your kids don&apos;t have job  </text><text start="2354.56" dur="4.72">prospects and that proposition a looks like it 
will actually give your kids a better opportunity  </text><text start="2359.28" dur="6.32">to have a good life so the value for you is the 
opportunity space for your kids lives okay well  </text><text start="2365.6" dur="4.72">maybe you&apos;re not an evil [ __ ] maybe that&apos;s a 
real value and maybe you don&apos;t even not care about  </text><text start="2370.32" dur="4.48">the owls you&apos;re just forced into a situation where 
that proposition unnecessarily polarized them  </text><text start="2375.68" dur="5.36">is there a way to care and but you think 
that i&apos;m evil because i want your kids to  </text><text start="2381.04" dur="5.52">be poor for some [ __ ] owls right well what 
if we just say how do we take all the values  </text><text start="2387.52" dur="3.84">and recognize that they 
are not necessarily opposed  </text><text start="2392.16" dur="5.52">and try to take all the values before we come 
up with the proposition and then come up with  </text><text start="2397.68" dur="4.64">a proposition that meets the values the best the 
best that it can we don&apos;t even try to do that most  </text><text start="2402.32" dur="4.8">of the time now a special interest group will make 
a proposition based on some very narrow value that  </text><text start="2407.12" dur="4.24">of course externalizes harm to other things we&apos;re 
not even trying to do a better job of that so the  </text><text start="2411.36" dur="5.36">idea of a democracy though and earlier democracies 
did try because of smaller scale like in the us  </text><text start="2417.76" dur="4.08">you weren&apos;t making huge choices they were mostly 
in a town hall where everybody could just talk  </text><text start="2422.48" dur="3.12">and so a special interest group wasn&apos;t making 
the proposition we were all talking we said what  </text><text start="2425.6" dur="3.12">about this idea well that&apos;s not quite right 
because of this what about this idea and you  </text><text start="2428.72" dur="3.36">could leave sometimes without even voting because 
everyone would just agree this is the thing to do  </text><text start="2432.96" dur="4.24">the there&apos;s a quote by one of the founding fathers 
of the u.s something to the effect of the death  </text><text start="2437.2" dur="4.56">the voting is the death of democracy because 
it means that we didn&apos;t have a good enough  </text><text start="2441.76" dur="5.44">conversation to come to shared understanding and 
then the vote was a way to sublimate violence um</text><text start="2449.6" dur="6.64">but the idea of can we get emergent order well 
if we can unify our sense making that we can make  </text><text start="2456.24" dur="4.4">sense of reality similarly and we can unify our 
values can i try to understand your perspective  </text><text start="2460.64" dur="3.12">you can try to understand mine well enough that 
we say now let&apos;s put all these values together  </text><text start="2463.76" dur="5.76">and then let&apos;s use design process to design a 
solution that will meet everybody&apos;s values as  </text><text start="2469.52" dur="4.16">best as possible maybe not perfectly but as best 
as possible factoring the physical constraints  </text><text start="2473.68" dur="4.4">that our sense making shows us that&apos;s the right 
kind of direction to be able to get emergent order  </text><text start="2479.2" dur="6.16">well we can see that since the modern democracies 
have emerged the world has gotten much more  </text><text start="2485.36" dur="9.6">complex technologically ecologically etc and 
our capacity for shared sense making and shared  </text><text start="2494.96" dur="4.4">meaning making meaning our training in civic 
virtue to listen to each other well with good  </text><text start="2499.36" dur="8.48">faith and our training in the relevant areas to 
understand the world has gotten worse right and so</text><text start="2509.92" dur="5.04">social engineering the kind of social engineering 
that brings about order through imposition  </text><text start="2516.72" dur="4.96">we&apos;re not interested in what we want is 
something that actually makes that kind  </text><text start="2521.68" dur="4.24">of social engineering impossible because the 
people recognize propaganda and manipulation  </text><text start="2525.92" dur="3.44">of those things when it happens because 
they have good sense making capability  </text><text start="2529.36" dur="4.08">and where that is so it&apos;s both impossible and 
not necessary because the people can actually  </text><text start="2533.44" dur="2.8">coordinate so what we&apos;re looking 
for is how do we socially engineer  </text><text start="2536.8" dur="4.24">a world where that type of social engineering 
is both not necessary and not possible</text><text start="2543.2" dur="2.16">now another way of speaking to it is</text><text start="2547.44" dur="5.68">conditioning of people is not avoidable you 
can&apos;t not condition people right they&apos;re  </text><text start="2553.12" dur="4.08">they&apos;re going to be born and learn mandarin if 
that&apos;s what they&apos;re hearing or they&apos;re going to  </text><text start="2557.2" dur="4.0">learn english or they&apos;re going to learn german 
or they&apos;re going to learn whatever that can just  </text><text start="2561.2" dur="3.84">what they&apos;re hearing is conditioning them right 
it&apos;s conditioning them to think a certain way  </text><text start="2565.04" dur="3.68">it&apos;s going to condition their aesthetics their 
values their whatever based on what they observe  </text><text start="2569.6" dur="5.52">so we have to realize that you can&apos;t not condition 
people so given that it&apos;s inexorable what is a  </text><text start="2575.12" dur="6.56">meaningful human life what what is a civilization 
that enhanced that makes meaningful human life  </text><text start="2581.68" dur="5.76">possible and how do we want to condition people 
such that they both have the best life possible  </text><text start="2587.44" dur="3.76">and can contribute that we have a civilization 
that makes the best life possible for the people  </text><text start="2591.76" dur="3.6">and people that are disposed to live their 
life in a way that in turn contributes to  </text><text start="2595.36" dur="5.36">a civilization in other people so i 
just wanted to say that briefly about  </text><text start="2602.4" dur="6.48">social engineering is that there is an 
element of association before you move on um  </text><text start="2610.0" dur="7.6">i&apos;m german i&apos;m a german citizen uh half 
Romanian and Germany&apos;s been very well known for  </text><text start="2618.72" dur="9.52">voting green and for decades we now had the green 
party in a leading political position in various  </text><text start="2628.24" dur="9.12">states within uh and now they have the opportunity 
to really go away go away from the opposition into  </text><text start="2637.36" dur="7.6">leading at the next election leading germany 
and one of the i&apos;m referring to question as to  </text><text start="2644.96" dur="6.0">how to implement what you just said because 
one of the and i am a green voter obviously  </text><text start="2651.76" dur="8.08">but one of the reasons why they were not leading 
a leading political party over the past 16 years  </text><text start="2660.56" dur="4.96">has to do although they tried has to do with 
from my perspective with the fact that they  </text><text start="2666.24" dur="9.28">try to well first of all they went into these 
never-ending conversations where no decisions  </text><text start="2675.52" dur="6.56">were taken or if a decision was taken they were 
trying to impose it on other people like eating  </text><text start="2682.8" dur="9.28">you know not not eating meat on fridays and that 
of course that and i&apos;m i&apos;m a vegan so i don&apos;t uh i  </text><text start="2692.08" dur="8.64">don&apos;t have a problem with that but that led people 
to not vote for them so my question is how do we</text><text start="2703.12" dur="8.56">optimize for the integrity of the whole or the 
wholeness in trying to come up to an emergent  </text><text start="2711.68" dur="8.4">order without ending you know in in these endless 
conversations and not having to impose a decision  </text><text start="2720.08" dur="5.36">on to people that do not agree with and lose 
political power and leadership for that matter  </text><text start="2726.48" dur="5.36">am i making myself understood yeah thank you</text><text start="2740.24" dur="1.68">i think the idea of the masses</text><text start="2744.32" dur="3.92">is class propaganda</text><text start="2751.04" dur="9.28">i think that if i want to be a ruling class 
the idea that most people are too dumb  </text><text start="2760.32" dur="6.4">and unmotivated and lazy and irrational 
to rule themselves well and so we kind of  </text><text start="2766.72" dur="3.68">have to rule because we are the ones who 
know what is right and good that&apos;s a very  </text><text start="2770.4" dur="6.72">convenient belief for those who happen to 
think they&apos;re part of that class and so if i  </text><text start="2778.0" dur="7.52">if i look in in i&apos;ll speak about the us because i 
know it&apos;s better so if i look at the dumb masses  </text><text start="2786.24" dur="6.32">that don&apos;t think africa is a country and can 
laugh at them and whatever which you we see  </text><text start="2792.56" dur="5.2">right there&apos;s a elite focus we&apos;ll we&apos;ll do that 
in the us but i look at the schools they went to  </text><text start="2798.96" dur="5.84">and they&apos;re shitty schools then i look 
at where do the wealthy kids go to school  </text><text start="2805.36" dur="7.52">and go to a place like exeter academy what exeter 
academy the average person becomes like a senator  </text><text start="2813.68" dur="6.32">right and like the people that do the worst 
still become partners at a law firm and</text><text start="2822.4" dur="3.44">i think if i took that person 
who thinks africa&apos;s a country  </text><text start="2825.84" dur="7.44">who had a shitty school parents no tutors and 
put them in the same position and put them in  </text><text start="2833.28" dur="5.52">exeter academy with the right tutors and teachers 
and everything around they would be similar so  </text><text start="2839.84" dur="10.56">the masses are the result of how we condition the 
people and this is why Benjamin Franklin said if  </text><text start="2851.28" dur="5.04">that the ultimate depository of the power must be 
the people there&apos;s no other thing that is actually  </text><text start="2856.32" dur="5.2">a trustworthy depository of the power and if we 
believe the people too uneducated to be a safe  </text><text start="2862.4" dur="4.08">vessel the only answer is educate them 
better everything else becomes evil  </text><text start="2867.92" dur="6.24">it&apos;s a big damn task but look at the 
options right the other options are uh</text><text start="2877.04" dur="8.8">starting with the idea that i i&apos;m meritocratically 
better right i know what is true and good and  </text><text start="2885.84" dur="5.92">right better so i&apos;m willing to like let&apos;s say i&apos;m 
gonna do this thing about nobody&apos;s allowed to eat  </text><text start="2891.76" dur="5.44">meat on friday whatever it is because otherwise 
climate change in the whole world will end and you  </text><text start="2897.2" dur="4.56">know it seems like it seems like it&apos;s worth kind 
of forcing people what i&apos;m saying is wait is that  </text><text start="2901.76" dur="5.2">a law does that mean i&apos;m going to take someone to 
jail if they violate it does that mean we&apos;re going  </text><text start="2906.96" dur="6.08">to use a monopoly of violence via a police force 
with an internal kind of military capacity to take  </text><text start="2913.04" dur="4.32">away people&apos;s freedoms because i&apos;m so certain 
that we know what is right that we&apos;re willing  </text><text start="2917.36" dur="4.0">to implement it with a monopoly of violence where 
does that go as you keep going with that process</text><text start="2923.52" dur="5.52">what legitimate authority is legitimate enough to 
be maintained not being corrupted in the presence  </text><text start="2929.04" dur="5.6">of that so basically when you come back to the 
early narrative i said that the problems that we  </text><text start="2934.64" dur="4.16">face today are not being solved by our current 
problem-solving processes so we don&apos;t just need  </text><text start="2938.8" dur="5.04">more business solutions and non-profit solutions 
and et cetera we need fundamentally new types of  </text><text start="2943.84" dur="4.96">institutions that have the right characteristics 
to solve these types of problems well who&apos;s going  </text><text start="2948.8" dur="6.16">to build those new institutions and it&apos;s important 
to get when we look at like the world has built  </text><text start="2954.96" dur="4.48">totally new types of government and new types of 
institutions for 200 000 years it was tribalism  </text><text start="2960.0" dur="3.6">and it wasn&apos;t until the emergence of the plow 
and baskets and a few things that we started  </text><text start="2963.6" dur="4.96">to get the different types of empires right and 
then that kind of emerged into certain dominant  </text><text start="2968.56" dur="4.96">types of empires and feudalism and then feudalism 
for so long that like the idea of something like  </text><text start="2975.28" dur="3.84">nation states and markets was that wasn&apos;t even 
an idea that that would that it would go that  </text><text start="2979.12" dur="5.04">direction and that new thing and then obviously 
post world war ii not just nation states but like  </text><text start="2984.16" dur="4.4">intergovernmental organizations at a global 
scale and multinational corporations so the  </text><text start="2988.56" dur="7.04">world does evolve at social technology and we 
can see that when the founding fathers of the us  </text><text start="2996.16" dur="4.48">were founding the constitution they 
didn&apos;t have ai as an issue to worry about  </text><text start="3001.52" dur="4.32">they didn&apos;t have eight billion people they didn&apos;t 
have planetary boundaries that were coming up they  </text><text start="3005.84" dur="4.48">didn&apos;t have such interconnected supply chains 
that a break in one area could break everything  </text><text start="3011.28" dur="4.32">they didn&apos;t have the capacity for a digital 
democratic system they had to try to fit people in  </text><text start="3015.6" dur="6.32">who would ride horses to fit them into a town hall 
so they were not trying to solve the problems we  </text><text start="3021.92" dur="4.4">need to solve today with their system the 
people who created the idea of markets and  </text><text start="3026.32" dur="5.68">the scottish enlightenment von mises and hayek 
and rand were not trying to solve these problems  </text><text start="3033.12" dur="5.04">and neither was marx neither was 
any of the social theorists so we  </text><text start="3038.16" dur="3.76">need fundamentally new social theory that 
starts with understanding our problem space</text><text start="3044.24" dur="5.68">and so the problem space requires new institutions 
and new problem solving capacities those have to  </text><text start="3049.92" dur="4.88">emerge from people popularly starting to want 
them care about them be willing to empower  </text><text start="3054.8" dur="6.08">them and participate with them so that the 
power of governance emerges from the consent  </text><text start="3060.88" dur="10.32">of the governed otherwise it will be imposed 
which is its own dystopia wonderful would you  </text><text start="3071.2" dur="6.96">like to dive into the consilience project as a 
contribution to achieving that goal of creating  </text><text start="3078.72" dur="6.56">developing a new social theory and education 
system to um to implement that to inform  </text><text start="3085.28" dur="6.8">the public space and avoid um you know ai and 
what google and twitter and facebook are doing</text><text start="3095.12" dur="3.12">yeah so everything we&apos;re talking 
about is the problem space that  </text><text start="3098.24" dur="3.2">the consultants project is focused on and um</text><text start="3105.6" dur="4.24">i&apos;ll take one more tangent first just because i 
think some of what i&apos;m referencing might not be  </text><text start="3111.36" dur="4.56">grounded an example for 
people it might be helpful um</text><text start="3119.92" dur="4.08">i&apos;m guessing that most of the people 
who are listening to this are aware  </text><text start="3124.0" dur="4.72">of many of the types of existential risk that 
exponential technology makes possible if not  </text><text start="3129.84" dur="3.76">go watch Nick Bostrom give a 
short overview of it on ted</text><text start="3136.96" dur="7.36">but uh you know briefly things like nukes are 
hard to make not that many places have uranium  </text><text start="3144.32" dur="4.0">it&apos;s hard to enrich uranium you can see who has 
it because it&apos;s radioactive from a satellite  </text><text start="3149.92" dur="5.52">it&apos;s not hard to make drone weapons commercial 
drones are good you can 3d print drones  </text><text start="3156.88" dur="4.96">being able to put the charges on them are easy 
you can take out infrastructure targets that way  </text><text start="3161.84" dur="3.84">infrastructure targets can lead to pretty big 
cascading failures if you know which targets to  </text><text start="3165.68" dur="5.44">look at we can see that that&apos;s happened a couple 
times recently and they were they weren&apos;t even  </text><text start="3171.12" dur="4.48">really good targets they were small things but you 
know the drone a couple years ago hit a ukrainian  </text><text start="3175.6" dur="5.52">munitions factory and little omega drone did the 
level of damage that an incendiary bomb would take</text><text start="3183.6" dur="2.48">run that out a few years see that tech getting  </text><text start="3186.96" dur="6.32">better and think about it you&apos;re like all right 
well how does and now think about how how cheap  </text><text start="3193.28" dur="7.28">crisper gene drives are and how easy cyber attacks 
on infrastructure are the thing that happened  </text><text start="3200.56" dur="5.04">with the pipeline the on the atlantic coast 
shutting down recently where nobody could get gas  </text><text start="3206.88" dur="3.52">we&apos;ve known about that for a long time nobody&apos;s 
done anything to protect for 25 years we&apos;ve known  </text><text start="3210.4" dur="4.0">that was a type of risk but now it&apos;s easy it 
was kind of hard before now it&apos;s super easy  </text><text start="3215.84" dur="8.16">so if we have decentralized meaning not just state 
actors but non-state actors we have decentralized  </text><text start="3224.88" dur="7.36">exponentially more powerful which could mean 
exponentially more catastrophic technology how  </text><text start="3232.24" dur="6.16">does the world remain anti-fragile in the presence 
of that it&apos;s a big question right it&apos;s a big  </text><text start="3238.4" dur="4.08">question for the most part western countries 
aren&apos;t even taking the question seriously  </text><text start="3243.76" dur="4.24">china is taking it seriously their 
answer involves ubiquitous surveillance  </text><text start="3249.36" dur="7.84">it&apos;s not a dumb answer it&apos;s a problematic 
answer um it&apos;s a smarter answer than no answer  </text><text start="3258.4" dur="7.12">what&apos;s a better answer we need to really there 
are i would propose better answers than that but  </text><text start="3265.52" dur="6.16">just to say if people have not thought about 
how exponential tech causes catastrophic risks  </text><text start="3273.2" dur="5.12">go look into that uh i have a podcast 
where i talk about that a bunch  </text><text start="3278.32" dur="4.16">that but when the other example of how could 
any of these emerging areas of tech innovate  </text><text start="3282.48" dur="4.16">in social systems i&apos;ll just give a couple 
examples just so you can start thinking about it</text><text start="3288.8" dur="3.52">you think about new computer 
technology like blockchain  </text><text start="3292.32" dur="2.8">or some other kind of 
decentralized uncorruptable ledger</text><text start="3297.36" dur="6.72">what if all government spending was on a 
blockchain which meant that it could be  </text><text start="3304.08" dur="6.16">perfectly audited transparently by anybody and you 
could see where the money flowed with the total  </text><text start="3310.24" dur="5.2">prominent provenance of data and there couldn&apos;t 
be any missing money and there couldn&apos;t be emails  </text><text start="3315.44" dur="4.4">that got lost or burned or whatever because 
you had uncorruptable ledgers or transparent  </text><text start="3320.4" dur="4.8">well there&apos;s a whole bunch of corruption that 
just can&apos;t happen now you just made it impossible  </text><text start="3325.2" dur="6.4">through a kind of technologically enforced 
transparency that&apos;s pretty great like that changed  </text><text start="3331.6" dur="5.68">a lot of stuff when you start to look at how much 
unaccounted for money there are in federal systems</text><text start="3340.0" dur="6.56">look at ai technology you look at the ability 
of ai to take a number of different faces and  </text><text start="3346.56" dur="3.68">make a new face that isn&apos;t actually a real 
human face but looks like a real human face  </text><text start="3350.24" dur="4.16">because they averaged these different faces 
they can do that with sound other things</text><text start="3357.44" dur="3.84">someone actually just emailed me a proposition 
they&apos;re working on about this the other day and  </text><text start="3361.28" dur="5.52">such a well-formed proposition what if 
we use the same underlying ai technology  </text><text start="3366.8" dur="4.64">to look at a semantic field of proposals that 
people have and come up with a new proposition  </text><text start="3372.24" dur="7.04">that is the weighted center of all of those 
propositions could we actually factor a humongous  </text><text start="3379.28" dur="7.12">amount of human input and be able to come up 
with better propositions where then humans  </text><text start="3386.4" dur="6.56">can take those propositions and go through 
something like a div merge process to be able to  </text><text start="3393.92" dur="3.12">come up with better refinements on 
the proposition to move it through  </text><text start="3397.04" dur="9.12">well that&apos;s not voting but it&apos;s achieving the goal 
of voting is better than it it&apos;s and uh what about  </text><text start="3406.16" dur="5.68">the kind of attention hijacking tech that facebook 
or youtube have where you think you&apos;re just gonna  </text><text start="3411.84" dur="8.08">check for a second and then an hour went by well 
it&apos;s taking unbelievable personalized data about  </text><text start="3419.92" dur="4.64">your behavior building behavioral models and 
then being able to use that ability to control  </text><text start="3424.56" dur="5.52">your behavior what if instead of maximizing time 
on site because they have an advertising model  </text><text start="3430.08" dur="4.64">they were maximizing your rate of learning and 
development they had a pedagogical orientation</text><text start="3436.8" dur="2.96">well that would be different right what about if</text><text start="3441.84" dur="4.08">why do we not have boating in person everywhere 
we can see taiwan made the shift right we can  </text><text start="3445.92" dur="4.24">see a few places are starting to work on it well 
if you can do your banking online with public key  </text><text start="3450.16" dur="4.88">crypto of course you can do that online and then 
you don&apos;t have to have voting be something that  </text><text start="3455.04" dur="4.0">happens once it every four years or every two 
years it can be a continuous process and where  </text><text start="3459.04" dur="3.2">you don&apos;t just vote yes or no on a proposition 
you get to help craft a proposition where you  </text><text start="3462.24" dur="4.24">can see the provenance of information that is 
leading up to it and who&apos;s influencing it maybe  </text><text start="3466.48" dur="5.76">you can even do things like a qualified democracy 
where before you get a vote on a proposition you  </text><text start="3472.24" dur="5.28">simply take a simple test that shows that you 
understand the pros and cons as generally stated  </text><text start="3477.52" dur="3.52">not leaning one way or the other so that you 
can&apos;t just get populist people that are coming  </text><text start="3481.04" dur="4.16">and voting without understanding it and that if 
you don&apos;t want to do what it takes to learn that  </text><text start="3485.2" dur="5.04">thing you can use liquid democracy to give your 
vote to someone who does understand it right so  </text><text start="3491.6" dur="4.56">there&apos;s a lot of things we can prototype with that 
are like wow that&apos;s really different that makes a  </text><text start="3496.16" dur="3.84">whole new set of possibilities what if you start 
getting lots of those together well when you look  </text><text start="3500.0" dur="6.72">at the rate of technological automation both in 
ai and robotics we&apos;re about to lose most of the  </text><text start="3506.72" dur="6.4">jobs oh but there&apos;s going to be new jobs that 
are competent another not not and there aren&apos;t  </text><text start="3513.12" dur="6.48">comparably in the same way this is why so many in 
the billionaire class are fans of ubi is because</text><text start="3522.08" dur="7.36">ubi is arguably the cheapest way to tend to the 
unemployed underclass to keep them from being a  </text><text start="3529.44" dur="6.4">problem and so you get a centibillionaire 
class who are the ones that control  </text><text start="3536.48" dur="4.96">the top of the power law distribution within a 
vertical right one of the things that happens  </text><text start="3541.44" dur="5.84">in the new areas of exponential tech is that 
Metcalfe&apos;s Law leads to natural monopolies and  </text><text start="3547.28" dur="4.8">power law distribution so amazon is bigger than 
all other online markets combined and facebook is  </text><text start="3552.08" dur="4.4">bigger than all other social media and youtube is 
bigger than all other video players combined and  </text><text start="3556.48" dur="4.32">google bigger than all of the search engines you 
get basically one owner of the whole vertical  </text><text start="3560.8" dur="4.56">right that&apos;s not through government monopoly it&apos;s 
through the natural monopoly of network dynamics  </text><text start="3565.92" dur="4.4">when we made anti-trust laws anywhere in 
the world network dynamics didn&apos;t exist yet  </text><text start="3570.32" dur="4.24">in that way so we didn&apos;t build that in 
and yet this the essence of antitrust</text><text start="3576.64" dur="4.08">should apply right which means our legal system 
can&apos;t begin to keep up with the rate of tech  </text><text start="3580.72" dur="7.52">changing the fundamental premises okay so you 
control one of those verticals of exponential tech  </text><text start="3588.24" dur="4.48">so you know deca billionaire 
sent to billionaire class  </text><text start="3594.64" dur="4.88">they get to compete with each other coordinate 
with each other for class interests and compete  </text><text start="3599.52" dur="6.24">with each other for who kind of runs the solar 
system and then some increasingly smaller number  </text><text start="3605.76" dur="6.4">of middle class who tends to those people&apos;s 
systems and then a much larger underclass  </text><text start="3612.8" dur="3.76">that is just not useful anymore because 
robots and ai are better at most things  </text><text start="3617.84" dur="2.96">so we we give them oculus and 
ubi so they&apos;re not a problem  </text><text start="3621.36" dur="6.48">that&apos;s a [ __ ] world that&apos;s a [ __ ] world 
and that&apos;s one of the attractors right now</text><text start="3631.04" dur="5.36">now the same tech can be implemented towards 
very different purposes that make a much higher  </text><text start="3637.04" dur="5.28">quality of life possible but again when you take 
the detect oh so you take that text and emerge so  </text><text start="3643.44" dur="4.64">all right well the jobs are going to get automated 
well that sucks if the people need the jobs  </text><text start="3649.76" dur="3.36">well UBI&apos;s one way to make the people not 
need the jobs but still with quite low  </text><text start="3653.84" dur="3.04">autonomy and upward mobility and etc</text><text start="3659.2" dur="5.28">but beyond UBI is something like access to 
commonwealth resources actually gets beyond  </text><text start="3664.48" dur="8.48">just individual possession and ownership being 
the only way to have access and being able to  </text><text start="3672.96" dur="6.48">separate the meritocratic stewardship of resources 
from access to quality of life those are things  </text><text start="3679.44" dur="5.92">that are both mediated by dollars right now but 
can easily be separated should be separated well  </text><text start="3685.92" dur="5.04">technological automation automating the easiest 
things to automate are the things that are most  </text><text start="3690.96" dur="3.6">rote the things that are most wrote are the 
things that people like to do the least anyways  </text><text start="3695.52" dur="8.32">so could we direct this tech in a different 
way a not centibillionaire class oriented  </text><text start="3703.84" dur="6.56">not a short-term roi but a how do we make a 
beautiful civilization way where we say okay  </text><text start="3710.4" dur="5.12">great so we can automate the shitty jobs awesome 
we used to have to financially incent people to do  </text><text start="3715.52" dur="4.24">those shitty jobs because civilization needed the 
jobs to get done so we made it to where the people  </text><text start="3719.76" dur="3.6">needed the job so the market forced them rather 
than the state forcing them because otherwise we  </text><text start="3723.36" dur="4.16">called it totalitarianism and didn&apos;t like it we&apos;d 
rather let the market force well we just changed  </text><text start="3727.52" dur="4.0">one of the underlying bases of capitalist theory 
communist area everything which is you need a  </text><text start="3731.52" dur="4.48">labor force you don&apos;t need a labor force you have 
to rethink all of economics from scratch now okay  </text><text start="3736.0" dur="4.48">well now maybe we don&apos;t need a system of extrinsic 
incentive to force people to do shitty labor jobs  </text><text start="3741.36" dur="4.72">and you can make a whole education system and an 
economic system that is oriented towards intrinsic  </text><text start="3746.08" dur="5.04">incentive what is it that what what meaningful 
things could humans do with a life that they  </text><text start="3751.12" dur="3.68">would have intrinsic incentive for i don&apos;t have 
to extrinsically incent them to do we simply have  </text><text start="3754.8" dur="7.28">to support their capacity to do it so the same 
technologies that are being implemented based on  </text><text start="3762.08" dur="6.08">current easy market opportunity that lead to 
either dystopic worlds or catastrophic worlds  </text><text start="3769.52" dur="6.32">could lead to really beautiful worlds but it&apos;s not 
just based on the current easy market opportunity  </text><text start="3775.84" dur="5.68">it&apos;s based on designing it&apos;s differently aligned 
with long-term civilizational vision and i guess  </text><text start="3781.52" dur="4.32">this is one of the key things as a system that 
is in the process of committing suicide right  </text><text start="3785.84" dur="8.16">a self-terminating system is not a system you 
should try to win at and dollars are kind of  </text><text start="3794.0" dur="7.76">like the score card of how well you&apos;re doing 
at this current world game and so if i have</text><text start="3804.48" dur="9.36">what the market currently incense if i follow that 
i&apos;m not going to build a new system of incentive  </text><text start="3814.72" dur="5.04">if i want to build a new system of incentive 
where that 70 trillion a day of human activity is  </text><text start="3819.76" dur="6.32">incented in a different direction how i build that 
new thing is not going to be what&apos;s incentivized  </text><text start="3826.08" dur="5.84">by the current thing so it&apos;s going to be some 
people who make an evolution in their values  </text><text start="3832.56" dur="6.88">first who are willing to build new technologies 
in new ways social and physical technologies  </text><text start="3839.44" dur="4.32">together in new ways that create new systems 
of incentives that make it easier for other  </text><text start="3843.76" dur="5.92">people to onboard into those values but the 
the beginning of a new civilization is always  </text><text start="3850.24" dur="3.92">not winning at the previous one it is always 
willing to fight a revolutionary war to take  </text><text start="3854.16" dur="5.28">some real sacrifice to migrate to something 
because something matters enough that it&apos;s  </text><text start="3859.44" dur="6.4">worth not continuing to just try to 
be secure or win at the existing one  </text><text start="3867.2" dur="11.2">and this shift and in um sense making is the 
goal of the convenience project i didn&apos;t even do  </text><text start="3878.4" dur="7.2">consensus project sorry um thank you for bringing 
me back the goal of the consultants project is to  </text><text start="3886.24" dur="4.72">help this zeitgeist that the one thing that 
civilization needs to be centrally focused on  </text><text start="3890.96" dur="5.68">is the development of new social technologies that 
both employ and direct exponential technology the  </text><text start="3896.64" dur="6.64">goal is to not only get that zeitgeist out 
there but to get enough understanding about  </text><text start="3904.88" dur="6.32">what those new systems must be that the design 
criteria for decentralized innovation can happen  </text><text start="3911.2" dur="6.0">so you know we&apos;re writing a bunch of articles 
we have a we have a research team of people that  </text><text start="3917.2" dur="3.92">have been thinking about these things in novel 
ways for a long time from different disciplines  </text><text start="3921.12" dur="4.0">we&apos;re growing that team if people have 
the right kinds of background and insights  </text><text start="3926.0" dur="4.72">and so what we&apos;re writing is 
where people can understand  </text><text start="3934.16" dur="4.96">take any social system take the fourth estate 
take education take law take economics governance  </text><text start="3940.56" dur="4.8">fourth estate media if you&apos;re gonna have 
something like a democracy or a republic  </text><text start="3945.36" dur="2.24">anywhere where there&apos;s participatory 
governance the people have to know  </text><text start="3947.6" dur="4.64">what&apos;s going on to be able to vote and to be 
able to be civically engaged so you need some  </text><text start="3953.36" dur="8.0">uninvested way of giving everyone the sense making 
well obviously those systems were built with print  </text><text start="3963.04" dur="5.2">as the mechanism and we can see that the world has 
evolved into a way where they&apos;ve all been captured  </text><text start="3968.24" dur="6.0">by vested interests economic and political 
interests and then attention optimizing uh  </text><text start="3974.96" dur="3.6">social media technologies that 
deliver it to people micro target  </text><text start="3978.56" dur="3.52">the things that appeal to their biases 
the most they&apos;re in group by a system  </text><text start="3982.88" dur="4.64">so without a good fourth estate you cannot have 
participatory governance you need to be ruled  </text><text start="3988.48" dur="5.36">but the type of fourth estate that has ever been 
possible before is not possible in a post-facebook  </text><text start="3993.84" dur="7.2">world so what are the criteria for a fourth estate 
that is adequate where people for an information  </text><text start="4001.04" dur="4.16">commons and an epistemic commons that is adequate 
that people can participate in collective choice  </text><text start="4005.2" dur="3.44">making because they have good enough collective 
sense making what how do we do that in a  </text><text start="4008.64" dur="4.72">post-digital world so we have a series of articles 
we&apos;re building that help people understand what  </text><text start="4013.36" dur="4.4">any civilization that wants that participatory 
governance needs in terms of an epidemic commons  </text><text start="4018.64" dur="4.4">why the technologies that have emerged have 
broke the previous answers completely and  </text><text start="4023.04" dur="4.96">forever and we can&apos;t go back to them and what 
the criteria of the new solutions must look like  </text><text start="4028.8" dur="5.2">now exactly how to build it we&apos;re not saying 
because there&apos;s different ways but what we&apos;re  </text><text start="4034.0" dur="3.44">saying is these are the criteria that 
it must be so now if you want to build  </text><text start="4037.44" dur="4.32">a blockchain organization or you are a nation 
state and want to try to innovate as a nation  </text><text start="4041.76" dur="7.6">state or whatever it is great like work on these 
things same with education what we can show how  </text><text start="4049.36" dur="5.04">emerging tech has destroyed the previous system 
of education and obsoleted it and then say what is  </text><text start="4054.4" dur="5.76">education in a post technological automation post 
ai post information singularity world well must be  </text><text start="4060.16" dur="6.8">these things right so our goal is to basically get 
the curriculum or the metacurriculum it could be  </text><text start="4066.96" dur="5.28">it could be translated to different pedagogical 
levels but the key insights of the metacurriculum  </text><text start="4072.24" dur="4.8">that is needed for people to be engaged in 
the design of the future of civilization  </text><text start="4077.04" dur="8.48">right to get that out there and then to get it 
translated to where at least for most people  </text><text start="4085.52" dur="5.52">won&apos;t be actively in designing these systems some 
will but they will at least be calling for them  </text><text start="4091.04" dur="4.56">so the people who are building them will be 
able to have support whether it&apos;s political  </text><text start="4095.6" dur="6.48">support economic support social support whatever 
so we&apos;re writing these articles and then trying to  </text><text start="4102.08" dur="4.96">translate the info and the articles through things 
like this through podcasts and conversations that  </text><text start="4107.04" dur="4.64">are able to translate them and where people who 
do understand them will be able to translate the  </text><text start="4111.68" dur="7.52">message to their audiences and so you start to 
get a decentralized zeitgeist of people caring  </text><text start="4119.2" dur="10.0">about uh what we think is um valuable for people 
to care about so as to be directing innovation</text><text start="4131.44" dur="6.32">brilliant so building metacurricular curricula 
for various disciplines around the world  </text><text start="4138.4" dur="2.72">um ken wilbur of which i&apos;m a fan has</text><text start="4144.32" dur="7.04">experienced more than 60 disciplines you know that 
adopted the integral model and so it&apos;s a it&apos;s a  </text><text start="4151.36" dur="9.04">long journey uh for you will there there be a meta 
curriculum for investing and or entrepreneurship  </text><text start="4161.92" dur="2.08">can what what is your plan</text><text start="4167.44" dur="6.4">so let&apos;s say people start thinking about all 
right well what are the risks associated with  </text><text start="4173.84" dur="2.72">these various areas of exponential 
tech what would it take to bind that  </text><text start="4177.84" dur="6.4">can if i&apos;m as if i&apos;m a government agency i can 
think about what state capacities do we have to do  </text><text start="4184.24" dur="5.52">that or could we make i&apos;m a non-profit i can think 
about that i&apos;m a business i can think about or  </text><text start="4189.76" dur="4.72">what kind of business could we build we can also 
do things that are more creative than business as  </text><text start="4194.48" dur="7.92">we&apos;ve understood it things like a decentralized 
autonomous organization in the crypto space um so</text><text start="4205.36" dur="4.72">all of those are different ways of trying 
to organize people and steward resource  </text><text start="4210.72" dur="1.04">to build something</text><text start="4214.0" dur="5.44">so you know if we look at the gates foundation 
there was basically a kind of world view that  </text><text start="4219.44" dur="7.76">informed a philanthropic hypothesis and it was the 
like let&apos;s apply business metrics kind of business  </text><text start="4227.2" dur="6.64">analytic metrics to philanthropy i would say that 
what we&apos;re talking about would make a basis for  </text><text start="4233.84" dur="13.28">new philanthropy which is let&apos;s donate money to 
the projects that are working on building the  </text><text start="4247.12" dur="6.16">new institutions necessary the new civilization 
systems necessary um because again otherwise the  </text><text start="4253.28" dur="3.52">billion dollars that we donate going against 70 
trillion dollars a day it&apos;s not going to matter  </text><text start="4256.8" dur="5.36">that much so how do we actually build new systems 
that can scale to the thing that needs to happen  </text><text start="4263.68" dur="6.72">in the same way that that could be the basis 
of a philanthropic uh hypothesis it could also  </text><text start="4270.4" dur="6.4">be the basis of a return hypothesis it says 
okay if we&apos;re not trying to maximize returns  </text><text start="4277.68" dur="4.48">in the short term no matter how nasty the 
thing is but we&apos;re trying to create returns</text><text start="4285.36" dur="6.64">while and through having that capital support 
the most meaningful things that it could  </text><text start="4292.72" dur="5.12">and what we&apos;re pointing out is a basis 
of criteria for assessing what meaningful  </text><text start="4297.84" dur="3.12">things are is this good design is it 
actually moving in the right direction  </text><text start="4301.76" dur="5.04">yeah absolutely i hope for that to 
become the basis of investment hypothesis</text><text start="4310.24" dur="6.24">and i mean even just listening to this someone 
can start to think about oh you have a piece of  </text><text start="4316.48" dur="4.56">technology that harvests people&apos;s individual data 
and does personal micro targeting to be able to  </text><text start="4321.04" dur="3.92">affect their direct their attention that sounds 
like a very profitable business towards what aim  </text><text start="4326.48" dur="5.04">is it going and what are the secondary effects 
oh it&apos;s going to be this thing called facebook  </text><text start="4331.52" dur="3.92">it&apos;s really for dating and then it&apos;ll be like 
for tagging pictures well let&apos;s think through it  </text><text start="4335.44" dur="3.2">a little bit how does it pay for itself it&apos;s 
going to be an ad model how do you so it&apos;s  </text><text start="4339.36" dur="4.08">you sell more ads based on more time on site 
how do you optimize time on site when people  </text><text start="4343.44" dur="4.88">want to get off and do things in the real world 
well through the things that are stickiest so  </text><text start="4348.32" dur="3.04">how do you figure that out when there&apos;s a 
huge amount of stuff well we use ai and we  </text><text start="4351.36" dur="6.72">use their data oh so the secondary effect of 
this picture tagging app is going to be that  </text><text start="4358.08" dur="4.16">it drives addiction in the entire population 
and doubles down on everyone&apos;s bias and limbic  </text><text start="4362.24" dur="5.52">hijacks and destroys democracy in the process 
awesome no i don&apos;t want to invest in that um  </text><text start="4367.76" dur="6.96">so well now if you want to change the design 
criteria right they shouldn&apos;t have an ad model  </text><text start="4376.32" dur="4.0">people pay for the service and now the service 
they are the customer and so you have a fiduciary  </text><text start="4380.32" dur="4.32">responsibility to them rather than to the 
advertiser and the people of the product now we  </text><text start="4384.64" dur="4.72">can actually do something that&apos;s meaningful to the 
people yeah i&apos;ll invest in that thing and maybe  </text><text start="4389.36" dur="5.04">it has a longer return cycle awesome long return 
cycles are necessary to do things that aren&apos;t evil  </text><text start="4395.76" dur="9.04">um the short term money on money process like it&apos;s 
very important to understand that capitalism is  </text><text start="4404.8" dur="5.84">not business it&apos;s not the same thing business 
was pre-capitalism business was the idea of  </text><text start="4410.64" dur="4.0">how do i make a good or service that people 
actually want based on real demand and how  </text><text start="4414.64" dur="3.68">do i make the best good or service at the 
best value so that a hopefully rational  </text><text start="4418.32" dur="5.52">person will make a good choice and in doing 
so i get more money through production only  </text><text start="4424.64" dur="6.16">of real value at a good at a good value uh in 
which case i&apos;m a good steward of that money  </text><text start="4430.8" dur="4.88">because i&apos;m going to continue to produce real 
value that&apos;s kind of like a very brief version of  </text><text start="4436.4" dur="8.16">randian market ideology it&apos;s not capitalism uh 
capitalism is once you start doing that and you  </text><text start="4444.56" dur="6.88">have a big pool of capital and you realize that 
compound interest makes money faster and financial  </text><text start="4451.44" dur="5.2">services of various kinds make money faster than 
the good or service because the good or service  </text><text start="4456.64" dur="5.76">has a cost of goods sold and the money doesn&apos;t um 
and the money has an exponential return on it the  </text><text start="4462.4" dur="4.4">other thing doesn&apos;t have an exponential return 
capitalism is about stewarding pools of capital  </text><text start="4466.8" dur="5.92">to create more capital and you know the saying 
that dumb criminals break laws smart criminals  </text><text start="4472.72" dur="4.8">make laws they start to recognize well who makes 
laws lobbyists who pays for them people with money  </text><text start="4478.24" dur="6.64">why do they do it because they can make more money 
if they do the thing and uh what do politicians do  </text><text start="4484.88" dur="4.4">after they stop being politicians well they&apos;re 
still economic actors oh great so if i have more  </text><text start="4489.28" dur="10.24">money i can also change law in uh the direction 
of the interest so capitalism works to we can also  </text><text start="4499.52" dur="3.84">create media companies we can also fund certain 
kinds of media we can also fund certain kinds  </text><text start="4503.36" dur="4.72">of research so what people even think is true is 
based on the [ __ ] that actually got funded so  </text><text start="4508.88" dur="9.84">um to increase those pools of capital i can 
pull on the levers of affecting policy affecting  </text><text start="4519.68" dur="5.12">media zeitgeist and style and like that affecting 
even research and the fundamental ideas of  </text><text start="4524.8" dur="5.68">what we think is true can affect all of them 
ultimately to be increasing optionality and power</text><text start="4534.08" dur="6.64">that that is not a system that is meritocratic 
where the more money you have is a sign of the  </text><text start="4540.72" dur="5.28">more good you did no it&apos;s not that&apos;s utter 
gibberish i can make money through production  </text><text start="4546.0" dur="5.68">i can also make money through extraction and as 
behavioral economics showed it&apos;s very easy to  </text><text start="4551.68" dur="3.84">compel people to not be rational actors so i can 
make money through producing valuable things where  </text><text start="4555.52" dur="4.88">i can make money through producing addictive 
[ __ ] and stuff that drives fomo that clearly  </text><text start="4560.4" dur="5.28">makes everyone&apos;s life worse and given that the 
supply side if it&apos;s a million dollar billion  </text><text start="4565.68" dur="4.08">dollar hundred billion dollar organization has 
way more coordinated power than the individual  </text><text start="4569.76" dur="6.8">purchaser does it&apos;s an asymmetric war to influence 
them where demand isn&apos;t driving supply supplies  </text><text start="4576.56" dur="4.48">manufacturing demand will the intelligent 
the whole base of markets area just broke  </text><text start="4581.6" dur="4.16">as soon as you can manufacture demand the 
idea that it is a collective intelligence  </text><text start="4585.76" dur="2.72">system is broken it&apos;s not a collective 
intelligence system now it&apos;s a paperclip  </text><text start="4588.48" dur="8.32">maximizer it is now an autopoetic process for 
converting people and the world into capital um</text><text start="4602.4" dur="0.88">why did we go there</text><text start="4605.52" dur="7.44">because you wanted to support our listeners 
investors and entrepreneurs to make better  </text><text start="4612.96" dur="5.28">decisions on where to invest and where to hide 
their capital and their efforts and all of their  </text><text start="4618.24" dur="7.36">resources toward and i&apos;m grateful very grateful 
for that so financial services were kind of the  </text><text start="4625.6" dur="5.6">beginning of the end of market theory actually 
having any real integrity because now i could  </text><text start="4631.2" dur="4.8">not be producing real goods and services but doing 
speculation and market manipulation blah blah blah  </text><text start="4636.88" dur="4.56">and the ability for short-term money on money 
creating so much advantage that we didn&apos;t invest  </text><text start="4641.44" dur="6.8">in real things and then you know things in the 
domain of atoms have cost of goods sold whereas in  </text><text start="4648.24" dur="6.56">the domain of virtual dome so i don&apos;t get unicorns 
in a year anywhere other than software but  </text><text start="4656.16" dur="4.0">whatsapp is not what the world needs to be 
better but all the money is going to flow away  </text><text start="4660.16" dur="3.68">from oh we don&apos;t have money for green tech and 
whatever because it flows to the area where you  </text><text start="4663.84" dur="4.64">get exponential returns that are making sure 
the world doesn&apos;t need based on manufactured  </text><text start="4668.48" dur="5.36">demand because it&apos;s where the return cycles 
happen that [ __ ] has to shift right so um  </text><text start="4674.48" dur="6.08">so can you make a return in the current world with 
the money you have sure doing some good things  </text><text start="4681.92" dur="4.8">but most of the opportunities authentically 
suck like most businesses if they shut down  </text><text start="4686.72" dur="5.36">the world would be better not worse um most 
new businesses that are emerging will cause  </text><text start="4692.08" dur="3.12">more externalities than the 
benefit they cause is worthwhile  </text><text start="4695.2" dur="4.32">most of the ways that people make money 
will cause enough harm to the world that the  </text><text start="4699.52" dur="5.28">philanthropy they do with that money will still 
end their life being net negative to the world  </text><text start="4705.76" dur="3.6">if someone wants to claim they&apos;re doing impact 
investing just [ __ ] be honest about this  </text><text start="4710.24" dur="6.08">like just don&apos;t do it as greenwashing it&apos;s evil 
just be just be a capitalist like that&apos;s fine like  </text><text start="4716.32" dur="3.92">it&apos;s better to be honest about it otherwise if 
you really want to do impact investing what do you  </text><text start="4720.24" dur="4.56">want to impact why like what do you honestly want 
to impact and look at clearly the second order  </text><text start="4724.8" dur="4.72">effects of the things that you&apos;re putting it into 
there are some things that are worth investing in  </text><text start="4730.96" dur="6.48">i want way more money going into fusion i want 
way more money going into many areas of energy  </text><text start="4737.44" dur="5.68">technology into manufacturing techniques that get 
to go close loop materials economy so we can make  </text><text start="4743.12" dur="4.24">all the new stuff from old stuff into the types 
of nanotech and manufacturing that can make that  </text><text start="4747.36" dur="5.76">happen those are longer term return cycles and 
they won&apos;t be exponential return cycles in the  </text><text start="4753.12" dur="3.68">same way because they&apos;ll have costs of good and 
they&apos;ll have r d up front and r d in the domain  </text><text start="4756.8" dur="5.6">of atoms is longer and slower more expensive 
than it is in the domain of software but that&apos;s  </text><text start="4762.4" dur="5.44">the [ __ ] the world actually needs and it can 
be profitable it can even be super profitable  </text><text start="4767.84" dur="5.84">because it can solve major world problems 
so larger investments that are longer term  </text><text start="4774.8" dur="4.48">we didn&apos;t get railroads with short investments 
like the railroad wasn&apos;t worth anything until  </text><text start="4779.28" dur="4.88">it went all the way across the country and so the 
industrial revolution required long-term planning  </text><text start="4785.28" dur="6.64">how long did notre dame take to build right 
like the the short-term return focus is  </text><text start="4792.64" dur="7.92">fundamentally destructive to life so 
one of the first things i can say is  </text><text start="4802.56" dur="5.84">have a term focus and then in the 
thing that you&apos;re investing in  </text><text start="4809.6" dur="7.28">is it solving a critical must solve problem 
for the world and what are the likely second  </text><text start="4817.6" dur="7.04">second-order effects it&apos;s causing if it&apos;s not 
solving a critical problem and if it generates  </text><text start="4824.64" dur="4.24">second-order effects that are worse than the 
problem it&apos;s trying to solve don&apos;t invest in it</text><text start="4831.36" dur="5.6">wonderful, Daniel it&apos;s been a great pleasure 
uh to speak with you again uh i know it&apos;s  </text><text start="4836.96" dur="5.6">two o&apos;clock in the morning your time
