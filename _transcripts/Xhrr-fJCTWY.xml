dur="12.0">what is your life purpose I think I&apos;ll</text><text start="107.67" dur="6.479">start with sharing a little bit about</text><text start="111.81" dur="3.66">how I think about that question the arc</text><text start="114.149" dur="3.961">of how I&apos;ve thought about that question</text><text start="115.47" dur="5.64">in my life which is probably going to be</text><text start="118.11" dur="4.829">more relevant for people than what my</text><text start="121.11" dur="6.299">particular answer to the question</text><text start="122.939" dur="7.8">happens to be as valuable as a question</text><text start="127.409" dur="6.091">as it is it&apos;s also a problematic one can</text><text start="130.739" dur="8.241">be a problematic one so</text><text start="133.5" dur="9.69">a kid I didn&apos;t feel like I could</text><text start="138.98" dur="6.01">actually make any choice without knowing</text><text start="143.19" dur="4.32">that because I didn&apos;t have the context</text><text start="144.99" dur="4.53">so the most trivial choices of what to</text><text start="147.51" dur="4.53">study or who to play with or what to pay</text><text start="149.52" dur="4.74">attention to like well what is the what</text><text start="152.04" dur="3.72">is the ordinate us for choice for me</text><text start="154.26" dur="5.4">what is it that I am making choices</text><text start="155.76" dur="5.91">towards and why and so I needed to have</text><text start="159.66" dur="3.27">a sense of the purpose of my life to</text><text start="161.67" dur="3.12">have a sense of the purpose of any</text><text start="162.93" dur="4.2">decision to have a sense of a basis to</text><text start="164.79" dur="4.02">choose and then to have a sense of the</text><text start="167.13" dur="3.48">purpose of my life I felt like I needed</text><text start="168.81" dur="4.44">a sense of the purpose of life writ</text><text start="170.61" dur="4.44">large to know what my life what the</text><text start="173.25" dur="4.65">embedding function that my life was</text><text start="175.05" dur="5.52">within and that usually looked like what</text><text start="177.9" dur="4.559">is the purpose of human life within the</text><text start="180.57" dur="3.96">whole and then even larger what about</text><text start="182.459" dur="4.051">life a thing we call biologic life and</text><text start="184.53" dur="3.84">then even deeper what is the purpose of</text><text start="186.51" dur="5.04">reality at all of something rather than</text><text start="188.37" dur="7.05">nothing and then of course we realized</text><text start="191.55" dur="5.61">that even the question purpose imports a</text><text start="195.42" dur="4.59">whole bunch of concepts that may or may</text><text start="197.16" dur="7.92">not be the right ones it purpose is an</text><text start="200.01" dur="6.539">inherently utilitarian concept and so do</text><text start="205.08" dur="3.659">I want to be asking what the purpose is</text><text start="206.549" dur="5.461">do I want to be asking what the inherent</text><text start="208.739" dur="4.5">value of life is what would I or what I</text><text start="212.01" dur="2.759">value do I won&apos;t ask what the</text><text start="213.239" dur="3.03">meaningfulness and the basis for</text><text start="214.769" dur="5.161">meaningfulness is do I want to ask what</text><text start="216.269" dur="6.841">the nature of it is so these are all non</text><text start="219.93" dur="6.869">sentence and all deep in terms of value</text><text start="223.11" dur="7.469">meaning purpose and all deep questions</text><text start="226.799" dur="5.541">and important ones we can also get in a</text><text start="230.579" dur="5.401">trap when we start to think about</text><text start="232.34" dur="6.94">purpose in terms of doing exclusively</text><text start="235.98" dur="5.099">and so very commonly people think what</text><text start="239.28" dur="4.2">is the purpose of my life and they think</text><text start="241.079" dur="4.021">that there is an answer in words that</text><text start="243.48" dur="3.96">relates to something that they&apos;re going</text><text start="245.1" dur="5.94">to do so I&apos;m going to end extreme</text><text start="247.44" dur="7.68">poverty or prevent AI catastrophe or</text><text start="251.04" dur="6.75">whatever it is and of course if that one</text><text start="255.12" dur="4.98">doing is their purpose then every</text><text start="257.79" dur="4.65">opportunity to relieve suffering or add</text><text start="260.1" dur="4.74">beauty other than that isn&apos;t part of</text><text start="262.44" dur="4.98">their purpose and that means the</text><text start="264.84" dur="4.26">presence being present with and loving</text><text start="267.42" dur="3.84">their family members isn&apos;t their purpose</text><text start="269.1" dur="3.39">being present with opportunities that</text><text start="271.26" dur="2.94">present themselves that they could</text><text start="272.49" dur="4.68">contribute to the piece of trash they</text><text start="274.2" dur="5.58">walk by on the street and so we start to</text><text start="277.17" dur="5.07">realize that one of the other challenges</text><text start="279.78" dur="4.59">is as soon as I define it then the</text><text start="282.24" dur="5.76">outside nough something that is</text><text start="284.37" dur="5.55">meaningful outside of that has been</text><text start="288.0" dur="4.23">excluded from my sons of purpose right</text><text start="289.92" dur="4.14">so then we start to say well there what</text><text start="292.23" dur="3.69">is the purpose of my life not just at a</text><text start="294.06" dur="4.37">doing level but at a being level that</text><text start="295.92" dur="5.31">all of the doing relates to and</text><text start="298.43" dur="4.54">obviously my best understanding of this</text><text start="301.23" dur="3.12">now might also be quite different than</text><text start="302.97" dur="6.66">my best understanding of it in the</text><text start="304.35" dur="7.29">future so is is there is there an</text><text start="309.63" dur="7.71">evolutionary process for how I think</text><text start="311.64" dur="8.25">about this so with all that as preface</text><text start="317.34" dur="5.09">I&apos;m obviously not going to address the</text><text start="319.89" dur="5.85">question comprehensively on this short</text><text start="322.43" dur="5.98">conversation so I&apos;ll speak to a few</text><text start="325.74" dur="7.74">things that are probably underneath a</text><text start="328.41" dur="9.24">question I&apos;ll say a little bit more</text><text start="333.48" dur="5.73">about and I&apos;m gonna hold them as</text><text start="337.65" dur="3.03">synonyms for now because the</text><text start="339.21" dur="4.02">distinctions take more work</text><text start="340.68" dur="5.94">philosophically and most people hold the</text><text start="343.23" dur="5.61">missing items so the purpose or the</text><text start="346.62" dur="4.71">meaningfulness of life from a being and</text><text start="348.84" dur="4.29">a doing and a becoming perspective I&apos;ll</text><text start="351.33" dur="5.67">just say a little bit about this and how</text><text start="353.13" dur="5.52">they fit together we can say that living</text><text start="357.0" dur="5.67">a good life living a meaningful</text><text start="358.65" dur="6.09">purposeful life has different elements</text><text start="362.67" dur="4.29">to it and so I&apos;m gonna offer a little</text><text start="364.74" dur="4.05">model here where there are at least that</text><text start="366.96" dur="3.51">will there are not at least there are</text><text start="368.79" dur="5.27">three elements to living a meaningful</text><text start="370.47" dur="9.8">life that are distinct but all necessary</text><text start="374.06" dur="11.8">so we can talk about the being mode in</text><text start="380.27" dur="7.93">which one way of defining it is the</text><text start="385.86" dur="4.29">purpose of life there is a to appreciate</text><text start="388.2" dur="5.1">the beauty of existence as deeply as I</text><text start="390.15" dur="6.98">can to take it in to be moved by it to</text><text start="393.3" dur="6.72">experience at a depth that the</text><text start="397.13" dur="4.06">purposefulness and the value of a piece</text><text start="400.02" dur="3.39">of art</text><text start="401.19" dur="4.32">requires it being appreciated there&apos;s</text><text start="403.41" dur="4.17">the relationship between subject and</text><text start="405.51" dur="4.35">object that is neither subject nor</text><text start="407.58" dur="4.35">object but but that triplicate the</text><text start="409.86" dur="5.52">relationship where the meaningfulness</text><text start="411.93" dur="5.61">comes and so when I am taking in the</text><text start="415.38" dur="4.65">beauty of reality reality is becoming</text><text start="417.54" dur="7.07">more meaningful and the deeper that I&apos;m</text><text start="420.03" dur="8.4">taking it in right so we can think about</text><text start="424.61" dur="6.1">purpose from the being point of view as</text><text start="428.43" dur="6.77">being about endeavoring to be more</text><text start="430.71" dur="7.02">present to reality as it is all the time</text><text start="435.2" dur="5.8">and when we start to think about doing</text><text start="437.73" dur="5.7">we can say that doing is about adding to</text><text start="441.0" dur="7.44">the beauty of reality acting in ways</text><text start="443.43" dur="8.16">that change reality with the hope with</text><text start="448.44" dur="4.98">the intent to add to the beauty of it in</text><text start="451.59" dur="3.84">ways that will increase the potential</text><text start="453.42" dur="4.05">for the experience of beauty for others</text><text start="455.43" dur="6.09">right there will effect the beat of</text><text start="457.47" dur="6.57">others when I think about becoming I</text><text start="461.52" dur="5.31">think about evolving my capacity for</text><text start="464.04" dur="4.53">being in doing increasing my capacity to</text><text start="466.83" dur="5.1">both appreciate and add to the beauty of</text><text start="468.57" dur="8.94">life and so I get that being doing and</text><text start="471.93" dur="7.56">becoming are all meaningful and they&apos;re</text><text start="477.51" dur="4.65">all meaningful only in relationship to</text><text start="479.49" dur="4.32">each other the doing adding to the</text><text start="482.16" dur="3.24">beauty of life that&apos;s all anyone did and</text><text start="483.81" dur="6.09">no one actually appreciated it would</text><text start="485.4" dur="7.98">ultimately be baseless etc right so we</text><text start="489.9" dur="7.4">can see how those are those are bound</text><text start="493.38" dur="7.74">concepts we can think about the being as</text><text start="497.3" dur="7.03">related to our relationship to reality</text><text start="501.12" dur="5.94">on the perceptual side and doing on the</text><text start="504.33" dur="5.22">expressive side we can see the whole</text><text start="507.06" dur="4.44">thing as our relationship to life with a</text><text start="509.55" dur="6.69">capital L or reality with a capital R</text><text start="511.5" dur="11.0">and so then you know I just speak about</text><text start="516.24" dur="9.99">it again in a broad way I can say my</text><text start="522.5" dur="9.51">purpose is going to be expressed each</text><text start="526.23" dur="8.51">moment in terms of how much presence and</text><text start="532.01" dur="5.97">love and integrity I can show</text><text start="534.74" dur="5.25">to life and whatever aspect of life</text><text start="537.98" dur="5.34">happens to be in front of me each moment</text><text start="539.99" dur="4.409">and across the arc of my life and so if</text><text start="543.32" dur="2.73">I have an idea</text><text start="544.399" dur="3.541">about what I should be doing that</text><text start="546.05" dur="4.2">actually makes me less present with</text><text start="547.94" dur="5.73">what&apos;s in front of me and less available</text><text start="550.25" dur="8.01">to appreciate and serve what&apos;s in front</text><text start="553.67" dur="6.84">of me that can be a problem now not just</text><text start="558.26" dur="7.74">the moments of life but also the arc of</text><text start="560.51" dur="7.32">life I want to see how full is my</text><text start="566.0" dur="3.66">relationship with reality moment by</text><text start="567.83" dur="4.83">moment and also across the whole arc of</text><text start="569.66" dur="4.83">my life how relevant was it to what was</text><text start="572.66" dur="10.17">needed for the whole of life during that</text><text start="574.49" dur="9.59">time so these are all interesting and I</text><text start="582.83" dur="4.44">think generally applicable</text><text start="584.08" dur="6.61">considerations for everyone if we want</text><text start="587.27" dur="10.5">to talk about the doing side for me as a</text><text start="590.69" dur="9.12">specific person well it&apos;s different in</text><text start="597.77" dur="3.87">this particular time in the world than</text><text start="599.81" dur="3.12">it would have been in the past or in the</text><text start="601.64" dur="3.42">future because different things are</text><text start="602.93" dur="3.48">needed and I have different capabilities</text><text start="605.06" dur="3.269">than I would have had in those</text><text start="606.41" dur="3.51">developmental environments etc and</text><text start="608.329" dur="3.271">obviously it&apos;s different here than if I</text><text start="609.92" dur="6.659">was growing up in the Peruvian</text><text start="611.6" dur="6.69">rainforest and so what mine is is not</text><text start="616.579" dur="3.75">going to be what anyone else&apos;s is in</text><text start="618.29" dur="3.69">that way right so it&apos;s there are</text><text start="620.329" dur="3.031">generalized things which we spoke about</text><text start="621.98" dur="3.68">and then there&apos;s also the unique</text><text start="623.36" dur="7.289">expression of those generalized things</text><text start="625.66" dur="8.44">so having the orientation to think about</text><text start="630.649" dur="9.721">systems and complex systems that my life</text><text start="634.1" dur="12.56">brought that orientation to me and</text><text start="640.37" dur="10.61">various other capacities orientations</text><text start="646.66" dur="6.85">doing what I can to help transition</text><text start="650.98" dur="6.849">civilization from being on a path that</text><text start="653.51" dur="7.5">is currently self terminating to a path</text><text start="657.829" dur="6.87">that is not self terminating and that is</text><text start="661.01" dur="6.21">as supportive of the possibility of</text><text start="664.699" dur="6.57">purpose and meaning for everyone</text><text start="667.22" dur="6.359">enduringly into the future and working</text><text start="671.269" dur="7.351">on changing the underlying structural</text><text start="673.579" dur="7.171">dynamics that help make that possible is</text><text start="678.62" dur="9.24">what we could say my main sense of</text><text start="680.75" dur="11.209">purpose that are doing level is so if</text><text start="687.86" dur="8.06">you think about your you&apos;re doing level</text><text start="691.959" dur="6.011">do you have goals for the year 2050 of</text><text start="695.92" dur="13.599">what do you want to change in the world</text><text start="697.97" dur="19.5">by then so 2050 is just over 30 years</text><text start="709.519" dur="12.18">from now what I would like to see</text><text start="717.47" dur="8.27">different in the world by them is first</text><text start="721.699" dur="7.111">I think it weren&apos;t saying that there are</text><text start="725.74" dur="6.069">existential risks risks of us continuing</text><text start="728.81" dur="4.92">to exist or not that could play out in</text><text start="731.809" dur="5.941">less time than that so it is not a given</text><text start="733.73" dur="6.12">currently that we make it to 2050 this</text><text start="737.75" dur="4.769">is an important part of framing that</text><text start="739.85" dur="4.65">question there are other existential</text><text start="742.519" dur="4.44">risks and catastrophic not necessary</text><text start="744.5" dur="6.689">fully existential but civilization</text><text start="746.959" dur="5.67">collapse type risks that even there are</text><text start="751.189" dur="2.76">some that could actually play out in</text><text start="752.629" dur="2.82">that time there are other ones that</text><text start="753.949" dur="3.51">might not play out in that time but we</text><text start="755.449" dur="3.93">pass critical tipping points where they</text><text start="757.459" dur="5.221">will inevitably play out after that time</text><text start="759.379" dur="7.5">during that time so one thing by 2050 is</text><text start="762.68" dur="5.849">I want us to not have experienced</text><text start="766.879" dur="4.741">civilization collapse or existential</text><text start="768.529" dur="6.961">risk and I also want us to not have past</text><text start="771.62" dur="7.5">tipping points that are irreversible</text><text start="775.49" dur="10.86">towards catastrophic or existential risk</text><text start="779.12" dur="11.459">and to speak even more broadly than I</text><text start="786.35" dur="7.469">would say I want by 2050 that we that</text><text start="790.579" dur="5.791">there is a change in the vector and</text><text start="793.819" dur="5.46">change in the overall trajectory of the</text><text start="796.37" dur="4.909">path that civilization is on from one</text><text start="799.279" dur="3.761">that is heading</text><text start="801.279" dur="3.691">towards many different</text><text start="803.04" dur="4.599">self-determination scenarios where they</text><text start="804.97" dur="4.799">were talking about the a hundred</text><text start="807.639" dur="3.75">different versions of AI apocalypse or</text><text start="809.769" dur="2.88">we&apos;re talking about world war three or</text><text start="811.389" dur="4.14">we&apos;re talking about

start="1518.83" dur="4.74">possibility state that much so we&apos;ve</text><text start="1521.08" dur="4.41">been looking at being able to articulate</text><text start="1523.57" dur="4.89">the generator functions in ways that we</text><text start="1525.49" dur="5.28">can show our complete meaning that</text><text start="1528.46" dur="4.17">solutions there are not only necessary</text><text start="1530.77" dur="7.44">for civilization making it but also</text><text start="1532.63" dur="11.22">sufficient and then actually developing</text><text start="1538.21" dur="8.31">architectures for viable solutions to</text><text start="1543.85" dur="4.709">those which means how how would an</text><text start="1546.52" dur="3.81">economic system a governance system a</text><text start="1548.559" dur="3.601">legal system and infrastructural system</text><text start="1550.33" dur="3.72">etc work that didn&apos;t do those things</text><text start="1552.16" dur="4.05">right that generated fundamentally</text><text start="1554.05" dur="4.35">different types of behaviour so we&apos;ve</text><text start="1556.21" dur="3.87">been been working basically on this</text><text start="1558.4" dur="5.1">level of understanding the nature of the</text><text start="1560.08" dur="5.79">problem well enough and then being able</text><text start="1563.5" dur="3.96">to characterize design criteria of a</text><text start="1565.87" dur="4.17">solution and then starting to develop</text><text start="1567.46" dur="5.16">actual instantiations of solutions that</text><text start="1570.04" dur="4.68">meet those design criteria next is</text><text start="1572.62" dur="4.05">starting to prototype then starting to</text><text start="1574.72" dur="3.9">prototype governance methods we&apos;ve</text><text start="1576.67" dur="3.62">developed to see that they do what we</text><text start="1578.62" dur="4.5">think they will and we&apos;ll find them and</text><text start="1580.29" dur="7.84">then you know before we can build a city</text><text start="1583.12" dur="6.689">state since it has an economic system</text><text start="1588.13" dur="3.33">that isn&apos;t any economic system that&apos;s</text><text start="1589.809" dur="2.821">ever been there&apos;s nobody trained and the</text><text start="1591.46" dur="3.78">things that they will need to be trained</text><text start="1592.63" dur="4.37">for how to administer it since it would</text><text start="1595.24" dur="4.32">have a governance system etc the</text><text start="1597.0" dur="3.47">politicians and lawyers and judges and</text><text start="1599.56" dur="2.619">bankers of the</text><text start="1600.47" dur="4.589">world would have nothing to do in that</text><text start="1602.179" dur="5.73">world and the corresponding functions</text><text start="1605.059" dur="3.99">don&apos;t yet exist fever into their that</text><text start="1607.909" dur="3.421">people aren&apos;t trained on them so there&apos;s</text><text start="1609.049" dur="3.541">a whole new civics right there&apos;s a whole</text><text start="1611.33" dur="2.49">new set of stuff that people have to be</text><text start="1612.59" dur="3.36">trained there&apos;s a whole new process to</text><text start="1613.82" dur="3.9">technology design for how to do</text><text start="1615.95" dur="6.479">technology that doesn&apos;t cause toxicity</text><text start="1617.72" dur="7.079">issues as you know an externality so</text><text start="1622.429" dur="4.441">that means that we have to have a lot of</text><text start="1624.799" dur="3.841">people working on components of it and</text><text start="1626.87" dur="4.38">getting trained in those components who</text><text start="1628.64" dur="6.3">will then be able to help build the city</text><text start="1631.25" dur="8.789">state scale and populate it you know to</text><text start="1634.94" dur="6.599">begin with and that is it it&apos;s deep</text><text start="1640.039" dur="3.181">enough training that lettle have to</text><text start="1641.539" dur="4.89">happen in immersive environments which</text><text start="1643.22" dur="4.92">means communities villages you know</text><text start="1646.429" dur="6.151">places where people are actually</text><text start="1648.14" dur="7.8">together working on training in these</text><text start="1652.58" dur="6.03">new skills and capacities that will then</text><text start="1655.94" dur="4.4">be able to boot and those will be not</text><text start="1658.61" dur="4.41">closed-loop they&apos;ll still require</text><text start="1660.34" dur="7.209">getting on a Boeing to fly somewhere and</text><text start="1663.02" dur="5.73">buying a computer from Apple but but</text><text start="1667.549" dur="2.76">they will be developing some of the</text><text start="1668.75" dur="3.059">capacities necessary to build a</text><text start="1670.309" dur="7.051">civilization with that along the curve</text><text start="1671.809" dur="7.291">so we&apos;re working on kind of as best as</text><text start="1677.36" dur="4.439">we can the full articulation and</text><text start="1679.1" dur="4.97">description of the design criteria that</text><text start="1681.799" dur="5.161">are necessary so that other people can</text><text start="1684.07" dur="4.54">can play with those ideas also and see</text><text start="1686.96" dur="3.27">if those design criteria makes sense to</text><text start="1688.61" dur="3.449">them if they agree with our analysis and</text><text start="1690.23" dur="4.679">then also work on those things</text><text start="1692.059" dur="6.0">independently and then start to work on</text><text start="1694.909" dur="6.15">instantiate and then evolving the scale</text><text start="1698.059" dur="7.98">of them towards full-scale prototype and</text><text start="1701.059" dur="9.271">then you know spread of that prototype</text><text start="1706.039" dur="6.721">that prototype has to be not only right</text><text start="1710.33" dur="3.93">in kind meaning that it is solved the</text><text start="1712.76" dur="3.81">generator functions but it also has to</text><text start="1714.26" dur="3.539">be anti fragile in the presence of the</text><text start="1716.57" dur="3.78">fact that the rest of the world was</text><text start="1717.799" dur="4.411">still rival risk and this is a new</text><text start="1720.35" dur="4.439">system and it also has to be out of</text><text start="1722.21" dur="7.32">poetic meaning it has to be able to make</text><text start="1724.789" dur="6.421">expand and propagate itself so those are</text><text start="1729.53" dur="4.54">all parts of the design criteria so</text><text start="1731.21" dur="7.3">those are those are some of the things</text><text start="1734.07" dur="11.52">that I&apos;m working on now towards those</text><text start="1738.51" dur="11.13">goals so if listeners want to support</text><text start="1745.59" dur="7.26">you in your mission in your purpose how</text><text start="1749.64" dur="8.1">can people help you mmm</text><text start="1752.85" dur="8.64">thank you for that I don&apos;t know since I</text><text start="1757.74" dur="9.45">don&apos;t know what skills and aptitudes and</text><text start="1761.49" dur="14.69">passions and resources they have one</text><text start="1767.19" dur="16.5">thing I would say is it all needs done</text><text start="1776.18" dur="11.26">right it it all needs done so the if</text><text start="1783.69" dur="7.35">someone currently is working on trying</text><text start="1787.44" dur="6.09">to solve coral reef issues or carbon</text><text start="1791.04" dur="8.22">sequestration issues or a I risk issues</text><text start="1793.53" dur="7.32">whatever and they have a path to make</text><text start="1799.26" dur="5.22">meaningful progress there keep doing</text><text start="1800.85" dur="4.07">that our chance of doing what we&apos;re</text><text start="1804.48" dur="3.06">doing</text><text start="1804.92" dur="4.18">depends on assuming that lots of people</text><text start="1807.54" dur="4.95">are trying to do lots of important</text><text start="1809.1" dur="5.58">things right so knowing that we&apos;re</text><text start="1812.49" dur="6.06">working on the same project at a meta</text><text start="1814.68" dur="7.38">level the re trajectory of civilization</text><text start="1818.55" dur="6.12">to a better trajectory that&apos;s one thing</text><text start="1822.06" dur="4.95">I would say wow those big projects are</text><text start="1824.67" dur="5.73">happening that children still need</text><text start="1827.01" dur="6.9">raised and old people need taken care of</text><text start="1830.4" dur="5.13">and food needs grown and all those</text><text start="1833.91" dur="4.08">things and if you&apos;re doing those things</text><text start="1835.53" dur="3.93">do them all so with full presence</text><text start="1837.99" dur="5.97">integrity love realizing that they&apos;re</text><text start="1839.46" dur="6.75">critical and if those are the things for</text><text start="1843.96" dur="5.24">you to be doing as far as the specific</text><text start="1846.21" dur="6.6">projects we&apos;re working on</text><text start="1849.2" dur="6.85">go to my blog and read the stuff and see</text><text start="1852.81" dur="5.19">if it can you know it&apos;s compelling I&apos;ve</text><text start="1856.05" dur="4.32">only written the tiniest little bit of</text><text start="1858.0" dur="4.4">stuff on there I have a few podcasts cuz</text><text start="1860.37" dur="4.73">most we&apos;ve been focused on kind of a</text><text start="1862.4" dur="6.399">research and thinking about it more than</text><text start="1865.1" dur="6.88">sharing it just for a share time reason</text><text start="1868.799" dur="6.961">but getting more educated as a valuable</text><text start="1871.98" dur="6.12">part of it you can do a lot more that is</text><text start="1875.76" dur="4.35">relevant if you understand the nature of</text><text start="1878.1" dur="4.77">the problem space in the solution space</text><text start="1880.11" dur="4.92">better and so in addition to my blog</text><text start="1882.87" dur="4.98">there&apos;s a number of good resources some</text><text start="1885.03" dur="7.47">of which I have linked on my blog to to</text><text start="1887.85" dur="6.959">study and you know already right now and</text><text start="1892.5" dur="4.559">over the next period we there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="1894.809" dur="4.86">research we need to do there&apos;s stuff</text><text start="1897.059" dur="5.761">that we need to write this piece of</text><text start="1899.669" dur="5.101">media to develop there are so people who</text><text start="1902.82" dur="3.479">have those skills people who have funds</text><text start="1904.77" dur="5.01">that could support people who have those</text><text start="1906.299" dur="9.571">skills all of that is relevant so if if</text><text start="1909.78"
