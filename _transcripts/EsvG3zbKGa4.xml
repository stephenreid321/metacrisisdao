dur="3.51">some time and write some books which i</text><text start="207.78" dur="4.62">think is exactly what he needs to be</text><text start="209.49" dur="6.84">doing I wish he would put more out if</text><text start="212.4" dur="5.91">you want a taste of his ability read not</text><text start="216.33" dur="4.56">the way it&apos;s supposed to be a breathy</text><text start="218.31" dur="6.48">Airy of sin which is really an</text><text start="220.89" dur="7.41">outstanding book and not only is Neil a</text><text start="224.79" dur="8.15">brilliant thinker but he&apos;s a absolutely</text><text start="228.3" dur="7.26">amazing writer and so he in my oh the</text><text start="232.94" dur="4.69">number of theologians in the Christian</text><text start="235.56" dur="3.69">Reformed Church now again people</text><text start="237.63" dur="4.89">sometimes call me a theologian I&apos;m not a</text><text start="239.25" dur="4.94">theologian I&apos;m a pastor and you&apos;ll often</text><text start="242.52" dur="3.87">hear Tim Keller make the same comment</text><text start="244.19" dur="4.81">the reason being is that I&apos;m not</text><text start="246.39" dur="4.89">fundamentally an academic sure I read</text><text start="249.0" dur="6.239">some academic stuff but that&apos;s not</text><text start="251.28" dur="7.019">really my life or my training I&apos;m a</text><text start="255.239" dur="4.951">pastor and I&apos;m a pastor who has to</text><text start="258.299" dur="3.631">dabble in theology but you know we also</text><text start="260.19" dur="4.4">dabble in all sorts of other things</text><text start="261.93" dur="5.13">that&apos;s sort of what being a pastor does</text><text start="264.59" dur="3.31">but Neil in an interview said something</text><text start="267.06" dur="2.07">to the effect that he</text><text start="267.9" dur="2.82">on stuff maybe it wasn&apos;t an interview</text><text start="269.13" dur="3.06">maybe it was a personal conversation I</text><text start="270.72" dur="3.3">don&apos;t know but he wanted to spend some</text><text start="272.19" dur="5.039">time thinking about essentially thinking</text><text start="274.02" dur="4.649">about the afterlife and I remember when</text><text start="277.229" dur="4.831">he said that or when I heard that I</text><text start="278.669" dur="6.421">thought wow that&apos;s that&apos;s really good</text><text start="282.06" dur="4.859">and actually really important because if</text><text start="285.09" dur="4.889">the further I&apos;ve gotten into this</text><text start="286.919" dur="6.241">YouTube video talking out loud thing the</text><text start="289.979" dur="8.72">more I&apos;ve realized this is a real this</text><text start="293.16" dur="9.89">is a real issue in theology today that</text><text start="298.699" dur="7.171">the ceiling that we&apos;re experiencing</text><text start="303.05" dur="5.85">culturally I think has been around</text><text start="305.87" dur="6.19">theologically for a while and I probably</text><text start="308.9" dur="5.92">doubt that really sort of helped me see</text><text start="312.06" dur="4.41">that and again Dalitz book is a really</text><text start="314.82" dur="5.219">interesting book because to a certain</text><text start="316.47" dur="4.77">degree he makes the point that you know</text><text start="320.039" dur="2.371">you&apos;re gonna have to listen to miss</text><text start="321.24" dur="2.73">Frizzle and if you&apos;re gonna make</text><text start="322.41" dur="2.85">progress you&apos;re gonna have things are</text><text start="323.97" dur="4.41">gonna have to get messy you&apos;re gonna</text><text start="325.26" dur="5.01">have to take chances and that&apos;s a really</text><text start="328.38" dur="5.25">scary thing but if you look back over</text><text start="330.27" dur="5.34">the course of church history it&apos;s at the</text><text start="333.63" dur="6.81">point I&apos;ve made sort of on the heels of</text><text start="335.61" dur="8.489">of Alister McGrath spoke heresy which</text><text start="340.44" dur="5.13">which Sam says I&apos;m isn&apos;t really in the</text><text start="344.099" dur="3.901">book but I&apos;m course sort of extending</text><text start="345.57" dur="3.9">and well so sort of like the person at</text><text start="348.0" dur="3.27">the end of the services pastor that</text><text start="349.47" dur="3.449">sermon really spoke to me and then they</text><text start="351.27" dur="4.29">say what it spoke to them and I realize</text><text start="352.919" dur="5.461">I never said it maybe maybe McGrath</text><text start="355.56" dur="10.8">didn&apos;t say it but but theology and</text><text start="358.38" dur="10.92">heresy sort of co-develop and so it is a</text><text start="366.36" dur="5.779">messy process and and so Neil wants to</text><text start="369.3" dur="5.07">take some time to think about death and</text><text start="372.139" dur="3.821">say I don&apos;t want to use heaven I want to</text><text start="374.37" dur="3.479">use the age to come because technically</text><text start="375.96" dur="5.19">that&apos;s a better way of thinking about it</text><text start="377.849" dur="5.161">heaven is geography in a sense and the</text><text start="381.15" dur="3.84">age to come is there&apos;s a new heavens and</text><text start="383.01" dur="4.56">a new earth that are seen at the end of</text><text start="384.99" dur="4.08">the book of Revelation and so I think I</text><text start="387.57" dur="2.909">really want Neil to make some progress</text><text start="389.07" dur="4.65">here because I think this is really</text><text start="390.479" dur="7.41">something that we need the the thought</text><text start="393.72" dur="7.05">occurred to me strictly a hypothetical</text><text start="397.889" dur="3.911">story not really

dur="4.681">cat might have eked out a short life in</text><text start="426.129" dur="6.151">an urban setting but it now gets to</text><text start="428.59" dur="8.329">realize what a human bed is like and</text><text start="432.28" dur="7.59">what a bowl full of food is like and</text><text start="436.919" dur="5.261">this is certainly an upgrade from living</text><text start="439.87" dur="5.34">in

but</text><text start="448.449" dur="4.53">but the author made the observation that</text><text start="450.789" dur="3.961">lions in the zoo we look at those lions</text><text start="452.979" dur="3.75">in the zoo and say oh they should be out</text><text start="454.75" dur="3.75">on the Serengeti well zoo lions live</text><text start="456.729" dur="4.68">longer they&apos;ve got free food and health</text><text start="458.5" dur="5.699">care and well well well there&apos;s</text><text start="461.409" dur="9.06">something that we notice the is not</text><text start="464.199" dur="10.62">optimized about the about the about the</text><text start="470.469" dur="6.6">zoo experience for a lion but the author</text><text start="474.819" dur="4.611">of that book why can&apos;t I think of the</text><text start="477.069" dur="6.511">book big tiger on the very famous book</text><text start="479.43" dur="5.739">Martell is the author you know he makes</text><text start="483.58" dur="3.269">a really important point in that book</text><text start="485.169" dur="4.62">that if you were to say if someone were</text><text start="486.849" dur="5.011">to say zoo logically float down over</text><text start="489.789" dur="3.451">humanity and look at human being and say</text><text start="491.86" dur="3.359">oh look at them they&apos;re all in these</text><text start="493.24" dur="3.84">little boxes in there they&apos;ve all got</text><text start="495.219" dur="3.54">this food and health care and stuff we</text><text start="497.08" dur="3.57">should yank them out there and

dur="6.329">human beings don&apos;t go there so here&apos;s</text><text start="507.31" dur="5.43">the thing this this cat could never have</text><text start="510.009" dur="4.981">imagined what living in a human house is</text><text start="512.74" dur="4.26">like and what having all the silly cat</text><text start="514.99" dur="4.32">needs are like I&apos;m a cat it&apos;s not a</text><text

start="537.89" dur="6.87">this cat the cat is indifferent in some</text><text start="542.93" dur="3.78">ways but very much once into the house</text><text start="544.76" dur="4.41">and very much wants onto the bed and</text><text start="546.71" dur="5.04">very much wants to be fed and on and on</text><text start="549.17" dur="5.67">and on and on but the cat could never</text><text start="551.75" dur="7.74">have imagined what a human bed feels</text><text start="554.84" dur="8.31">like why because the cat Kenna is not</text><text start="559.49" dur="5.97">capable of imagining such a thing on its</text><text start="563.15" dur="5.04">own it&apos;s only when a greater</text><text start="565.46" dur="6.21">consciousness a greater power a greater</text><text start="568.19" dur="5.55">mind a

start="576.14" dur="5.67">never in its wildest dreams imagined nor</text><text start="579.23" dur="7.59">could the whole community have cats come</text><text start="581.81" dur="6.99">up with and for that matter well we</text><text start="586.82" dur="4.62">still have questions about what is good</text><text start="588.8" dur="4.44">and in many ways that haunts a lot of</text><text start="591.44" dur="4.86">the conversations that we&apos;re gonna point</text><text start="593.24" dur="6.96">to so you know it was wasn&apos;t until</text><text start="596.3" dur="6.87">really I found the the Douthit book that</text><text start="600.2" dur="5.64">I really began to understand Eric</text><text start="603.17" dur="6.03">Weinstein and Peter teal a lot better</text><text start="605.84" dur="5.76">because I&apos;d heard them make noises about</text><text start="609.2" dur="4.41">this one way or another you know</text><text start="611.6" dur="5.04">especially use of the common use of the</text><text start="613.61" dur="5.4">word sclerosis in this Kondos context</text><text start="616.64" dur="5.13">that Douthit really helped me better</text><text start="619.01" dur="5.52">understand sort of what Eric Weinstein&apos;s</text><text start="621.77" dur="6.54">banging on about Eric&apos;s an interesting</text><text start="624.53" dur="5.52">cat now there&apos;s no

dur="5.34">helped contextualize that for me now</text><text start="634.55" dur="6.81">again I do believe that having a let&apos;s</text><text start="637.55" dur="5.58">call it a modestly sized YouTube

start="761.089" dur="4.021">and a lot of his conversations this</text><text start="762.8" dur="5.099">aching for a new religion that isn&apos;t a</text><text start="765.11" dur="6.93">religion and somehow we know we need</text><text start="767.899" dur="7.471">that even though again it&apos;s it&apos;s the I</text><text start="772.04" dur="6.239">mean secularism is is perhaps basically</text><text start="775.37" dur="6.089">the the demand that there be no appeal</text><text start="778.279" dur="8.43">to self conscious agents above human</text><text start="781.459" dur="10.141">beings that&apos;s basically it you know no</text><text start="786.709" dur="8.82">theism no aliens you know we&apos;ve got a</text><text start="791.6" dur="6.989">key we hold the bar here and so all of</text><text start="795.529" dur="6.131">our hope must be found there and I know</text><text start="798.589" dur="5.681">Karl Karl and I are</text><text start="801.66" dur="5.46">Carl that&apos;s why the iron box of</text><text start="804.27" dur="4.74">secularism because you can&apos;t think above</text><text start="807.12" dur="5.52">it because it&apos;s not allowed that&apos;s</text><text start="809.01" dur="6.24">essentially the secular bargain to say</text><text start="812.64" dur="4.56">keep it in here thank you very much so</text><text start="815.25" dur="3.75">your religious people yeah we know</text><text start="817.2" dur="4.29">you&apos;re out there and we really shouldn&apos;t</text><text start="819.0" dur="4.59">persecute you and but we&apos;re not really</text><text start="821.49" dur="5.1">gonna take too many of you seriously</text><text start="823.59" dur="5.34">because the this is the playing field</text><text start="826.59" dur="5.28">and everything needs to stay in these</text><text start="828.93" dur="5.7">bounds but this keep bumping into</text><text start="831.87" dur="7.83">needing a new religion is giving away</text><text start="834.63" dur="7.02">the game so in this conversation they</text><text start="839.7" dur="5.46">get to the point of wanting to know is</text><text start="841.65" dur="6.69">decadence so bad after all oh I didn&apos;t</text><text start="845.16" dur="6.48">set up huh so this stuff isn&apos;t on</text><text start="848.34" dur="6.54">YouTube so I&apos;ll play it out of my out of</text><text start="851.64" dur="4.71">my podcast app essential essential to</text><text start="854.88" dur="4.86">the argument that Ross is making though</text><text start="856.35" dur="5.19">is in understanding that a lot of the</text><text start="859.74" dur="3.72">economic gains that we&apos;ve seen and the</text><text start="861.54" dur="3.75">productivity improvements that we&apos;ve</text><text start="863.46" dur="3.12">seen have happened in particular places</text><text start="865.29" dur="3.39">where the gains have been really</text><text start="866.58" dur="4.53">concentrated in a few ands with these</text><text start="868.68" dur="4.92">technology companies Facebook being like</text><text start="871.11" dur="4.77">the new GM but only employing 1/10 of</text><text start="873.6" dur="4.23">the people that a GM might have employed</text><text start="875.88" dur="4.23">so that is part of the problem and</text><text start="877.83" dur="4.17">secondarily so so that&apos;s that&apos;s</text><text start="880.11" dur="4.53">essentially the argument of the first</text><text start="882.0" dur="4.26">half of half of Dow Fitz book the nature</text><text start="884.64" dur="4.53">of the innovation that we&apos;re seeing in</text><text start="886.26" dur="6.27">some places it&apos;s again like some sort of</text><text start="889.17" dur="4.92">technology information oriented benefit</text><text start="892.53" dur="3.48">that is again concentrated to a</text><text start="894.09" dur="5.07">particular group but also the</text><text start="896.01" dur="4.83">possibility that some of the gains we&apos;ve</text><text start="899.16" dur="5.25">seen as you just mentioned Russ are fake</text><text start="900.84" dur="5.97">like the growth of a company like uber</text><text start="904.41" dur="4.53">for example it&apos;s not clear that this is</text><text start="906.81" dur="4.2">a sustainable business model in fact all</text><text start="908.94" dur="4.47">of the indications are that it might not</text><text start="911.01" dur="3.75">be like in the same thing that we&apos;ve</text><text start="913.41" dur="3.36">seen with we work there running these</text><text start="914.76" dur="3.39">massive deficits as they have been for a</text><text start="916.77" dur="4.65">very long time they&apos;re doing it with</text><text start="918.15" dur="4.86">rather cheap money on offer from VCS you</text><text start="921.42" dur="5.01">seen the phrase free money used at</text><text start="923.01" dur="5.34">certain points so that all of that</text><text start="926.43" dur="4.14">creates a circumstance that&apos;s rather</text><text start="928.35" dur="3.54">challenging but I want to see if we can</text><text start="930.57" dur="2.58">advance the conversation a little bit</text><text start="931.89" dur="3.64">because we&apos;ve talked about sort of the</text><text start="933.15" dur="4.87">the four horsemen the stagnation</text><text start="935.53" dur="6.03">the sterility and the sclerosis and the</text><text start="938.02" dur="4.14">repetition what&apos;s that accent yeah yeah</text><text start="941.56" dur="4.43">I was an accident</text><text start="942.16" dur="3.83">that&apos;s just Camille no there was a growl</text><text start="953.43" dur="4.72">well we talked about those four things I</text><text start="955.93" dur="3.75">wonder if we can get into sort of the</text><text start="958.15" dur="5.16">second section of the book where you</text><text start="959.68" dur="5.58">talk about sustainable decadence among</text><text start="963.31" dur="3.78">other things but that section of the</text><text start="965.26" dur="4.11">book is probably the only place where I</text><text start="967.09" dur="5.43">got a little bit queasy when you talked</text><text start="969.37" dur="5.07">about giving decadence it&apos;s do maybe you</text><text start="972.52" dur="3.54">could talk a little bit about what you</text><text start="974.44" dur="3.42">saw there and if it&apos;s helpful I could</text><text start="976.06" dur="3.81">prime you by telling you what about it</text><text start="977.86" dur="3.93">maybe tell me tell me what made you</text><text start="979.87" dur="3.39">queasy well I&apos;ll tell you it&apos;s I think</text><text start="981.79" dur="4.11">you open the chapter by talking about</text><text start="983.26" dur="4.05">people who are probably following along</text><text start="985.9" dur="2.37">with you and thinking to themselves well</text><text start="987.31" dur="2.1">you know what this decadence thing</text><text start="988.27" dur="4.65">doesn&apos;t sound like such a bad thing</text><text start="989.41" dur="5.1">yep and and this is again right here now</text><text start="992.92" dur="5.66">we&apos;re getting into the question what is</text><text start="994.51" dur="7.41">good and so the value question so</text><text start="998.58" dur="5.59">decadence well a stable economy and and</text><text start="1001.92" dur="3.87">what&apos;s so interesting about this is that</text><text start="1004.17" dur="3.419">especially let&apos;s say if you go back to</text><text start="1005.79" dur="8.13">Alister McGrath brett weinstein</text><text start="1007.589" dur="8.731">conversation sustainability is is is the</text><text start="1013.92" dur="4.56">big thing you know and and that haunts</text><text start="1016.32" dur="4.95">ericsson we get when I jump into Eric&apos;s</text><text start="1018.48" dur="5.28">podcast sustainability is haunting these</text><text start="1021.27" dur="4.53">conversations because how do we and</text><text start="1023.76"

that</text><text start="1030.9" dur="4.08">think like us and you get back to the if</text><text start="1033.449" dur="3.561">you if you haven&apos;t listened to my</text><text start="1034.98" dur="6.06">conversation where we talked about</text><text start="1037.01" dur="7.3">religion as risk management the this</text><text start="1041.04" dur="5.76">idea that what we&apos;re really trying to do</text><text start="1044.31" dur="5.09">it&apos;s a very evolutionary idea the idea</text><text start="1046.8" dur="6.06">that what we&apos;re trying to do we is</text><text start="1049.4" dur="6.73">essentially secure the future for our</text><text start="1052.86" dur="6.0">progeny but that of course assumes that</text><text start="1056.13" dur="5.85">you can now we&apos;ll bring in the fancy</text><text start="1058.86" dur="7.02">verb a key ideas you can exactly figure</text><text start="1061.98" dur="6.35">out what the essence of we is and and</text><text start="1065.88" dur="3.929">that&apos;s what makes the let&apos;s say the</text><text start="1068.33" dur="4.889">humans evil</text><text start="1069.809" dur="6.33">solving into the Borg or some kind of</text><text

somehow breaks the</text><text start="1080.309" dur="5.85">narrative or breaks the line and so</text><text start="1083.729" dur="4.92">humanity is cut off in the sense like</text><text start="1086.159" dur="4.35">the Neanderthals and so that that leads</text><text start="1088.649" dur="3.87">to the question well well maybe we&apos;ve</text><text start="1090.509" dur="5.04">arrived well you know it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="1092.519" dur="5.821">interesting in 1999 they talk about 1999</text><text start="1095.549" dur="4.95">in this podcast as a sort of a a little</text><text start="1098.34" dur="3.749">break in decadence well that was the</text><text start="1100.499" dur="4.02">year the matrix came out and that&apos;s the</text><text start="1102.089"

certain</text><text start="1150.809" dur="4.021">that we find ways to perhaps</text><text start="1152.549" dur="6.151">redistribute the gains and just protect</text><text start="1154.83" dur="12.059">what we have here and and I think here&apos;s</text><text start="1158.7" dur="11.25">the thing that would require a societal</text><text start="1166.889" dur="6.36">religious conversion probably away from</text><text start="1169.95" dur="5.76">Christianity you know if you go back to</text><text start="1173.249" dur="4.56">the deling pod conversation with with</text><text

start="1720.76" dur="5.01">slide to horrible decadence I mean I</text><text start="1723.43" dur="4.32">think it&apos;s probably clear from reading</text><text start="1725.77" dur="3.66">the book that I&apos;m most worried about</text><text start="1727.75" dur="4.5">this sort of this sort of brave new</text><text start="1729.43" dur="5.55">world scenario where things stabilize in</text><text

dur="5.73">sort of decaying stability that loses</text><text start="1747.69" dur="5.25">basic human goods you know people people</text><text start="1750.63" dur="5.22">don&apos;t marry and have kids they sort of</text><text start="1752.94" dur="4.44">lose themselves in you know I compare it</text><text start="1755.85" dur="3.21">to the land of the Lotus Eaters right</text><text start="1757.38" dur="4.71">didn&apos;t odysseus and i don&apos;t think we&apos;re</text><text start="1759.06" dur="4.86">anywhere close to there to the darkest</text><text start="1762.09" dur="4.17">place yet but i think that&apos;s been the</text><text start="1763.92" dur="4.38">trend of the last 25 or 30 years right</text><text start="1766.26" dur="4.08">towards this like in teenage life right</text><text start="1768.3" dur="4.65">now do you gauge life in the u.s. is</text><text start="1770.34" dur="5.22">safer than it&apos;s ever been um in terms of</text><text start="1772.95" dur="5.19">whether you&apos;re gonna drive drunk or you</text><text start="1775.56" dur="4.41">know have sex or did all these things</text><text start="1778.14" dur="3.72">and these are all things conservatives</text><text start="1779.97" dur="3.81">were obviously very concerned about 30</text><text start="1781.86" dur="4.02">years ago so in a way you could say well</text><text start="1783.78" dur="6.39">this is what conservatives wanted but</text><text start="1785.88" dur="5.76">those same kids are not sort of well one</text><text start="1790.17" dur="3.84">they&apos;re more depressed and more anxious</text><text start="1791.64" dur="4.5">seemingly i think pretty clearly than</text><text start="1794.01" dur="4.17">even when I was in call know what&apos;s</text><text start="1796.14" dur="3.33">really interesting about Douthit spook</text><text start="1798.18" dur="2.79">is he has nothing good to say about</text><text start="1799.47" dur="2.82">Jordan Peterson Jordan Peterson gets</text><text start="1800.97" dur="3.62">like two or three mentions in the book</text><text start="1802.29" dur="5.19">but what he&apos;s talking about here is</text><text start="1804.59" dur="6.09">exactly what the Jordan Peterson moment</text><text start="1807.48" dur="7.14">was around and so now Douthit from his</text><text start="1810.68" dur="5.92">from his his peaks of status that that</text><text start="1814.62" dur="3.96">have him living in in New Haven</text><text start="1816.6" dur="4.86">Connecticut and working for the New York</text><text start="1818.58" dur="4.95">Times can&apos;t seem I don&apos;t think he</text><text start="1821.46" dur="4.56">understands Jordan Peterson the way he</text><text start="1823.53" dur="5.7">should but this is very much is where</text><text start="1826.02" dur="5.7">decadence meets the meaning crisis it&apos;s</text><text start="1829.23" dur="6.06">right there which they&apos;re more likely to</text><text start="1831.72" dur="6.48">commit suicide and then they&apos;re for now</text><text start="1835.29" dur="5.43">at least less likely to fall in love get</text><text start="1838.2" dur="4.95">married and have kids and sort of enter</text><text start="1840.72" dur="4.77">what in a conservative would think of a</text><text start="1843.15" dur="5.07">sort of a normal trajectory towards</text><text start="1845.49" dur="4.71">human flourishing and and so there&apos;s</text><text start="1848.22" dur="4.05">been this sort of trade-off of sort of</text><text start="1850.2" dur="4.44">more social stability than thirty forty</text><text start="1852.27" dur="3.84">years ago but maybe less happiness and</text><text start="1854.64" dur="4.65">less flourishing so that&apos;s what I worry</text><text start="1856.11" dur="6.36">about the most again like in terms of</text><text start="1859.29" dur="6.12">our ability to respond to threats though</text><text start="1862.47" dur="4.74">I think it&apos;s the sclerosis of</text><text start="1865.41" dur="4.17">institutions that&apos;s the most dangerous</text><text start="1867.21" dur="4.14">so if you&apos;re worried about and the</text><text start="1869.58" dur="5.46">corona virus or anything that could lead</text><text start="1871.35" dur="5.49">to mass extinction true disaster you</text><text start="1875.04" dur="4.11">should worry most about the inability of</text><text start="1876.84" dur="5.85">our institutions to function anymore</text><text start="1879.15" dur="7.35">is is this a Catholic book sure all my</text><text start="1882.69" dur="5.4">books are Catholic it&apos;s a good it&apos;s a</text><text start="1886.5" dur="4.41">great it&apos;s a great podcast you should</text><text start="1888.09" dur="4.74">listen to it I&apos;m I&apos;m I do like one offs</text><text start="1890.91" dur="3.48">of a lot of different podcasts but after</text><text start="1892.83" dur="6.69">listening to this one I thought listen</text><text start="1894.39" dur="8.58">to some more of these guys but but I</text><text start="1899.52" dur="5.34">thought Douthit made the point well of</text><text start="1902.97" dur="4.47">well here&apos;s decadence and again this is</text><text start="1904.86" dur="6.75">what I&apos;ve heard Eric and and Peter teal</text><text start="1907.44" dur="6.44">talk about but now suddenly here in this</text><text start="1911.61" dur="4.98">in this with with Daniel smacking burger</text><text start="1913.88" dur="5.53">Eric starts going down a different take</text><text start="1916.59" dur="4.32">and and Eric is is over time laying more</text><text start="1919.41" dur="2.79">and more of his cards on the table maybe</text><text start="1920.91" dur="2.94">I just haven&apos;t listened to everything</text><text start="1922.2" dur="4.65">that Eric is doing or these putting out</text><text start="1923.85" dur="6.12">a lot now okay this is this is a long</text><text start="1926.85" dur="5.67">one and and there there&apos;s I found so</text><text start="1929.97" dur="5.19">much stuff that have provoked insight in</text><text start="1932.52" dur="5.16">me in this podcast I&apos;m really tempted to</text><text start="1935.16" dur="4.17">sort of outline it and if anybody and if</text><text start="1937.68" dur="3.6">any of you know whether he&apos;s doing</text><text start="1939.33" dur="5.1">transcripts or anything like that out of</text><text start="1941.28" dur="5.22">this let me know you know his getting</text><text start="1944.43" dur="5.82">this stuff up on YouTube is always a</text><text start="1946.5" dur="7.17">long time after maybe he&apos;s not everybody</text><text start="1950.25" dur="5.43">works is cheap and dirty as me but he</text><text start="1953.67" dur="6.24">actually has real commercials on his</text><text start="1955.68" dur="5.85">podcast but but this is they both sort</text><text start="1959.91" dur="5.43">of you know they can do some things and</text><text start="1961.53" dur="8.58">by about 22 minutes they start to get</text><text start="1965.34" dur="7.83">into stuff alright so let me let me give</text><text start="1970.11" dur="4.74">a little bit of my frame we can try to</text><text start="1973.17" dur="4.53">pass things back and forth and feel free</text><text start="1974.85" dur="4.68">to take over if you like but here&apos;s what</text><text start="1977.7" dur="4.53">I see that I think of is being really</text><text start="1979.53" dur="6.15">interesting and rather mysterious I see</text><text start="1982.23" dur="5.97">a decision tree in which I think at a</text><text start="1985.68" dur="5.4">society-wide level I can&apos;t accept any of</text><text start="1988.2" dur="5.1">the major branches so one branch would</text><text start="1991.08" dur="4.05">be that we we have a self-extinguishing</text><text start="1993.3" dur="4.74">human event let&apos;s say an all-out nuclear</text><text start="1995.13" dur="5.49">war where people miscalculate and the</text><text start="1998.04" dur="4.79">planet is unrecognizable then there&apos;s a</text><text start="2000.62" dur="4.73">different branch that says that</text><text start="2002.83" dur="5.25">some sort of a environmental collapse</text><text start="2005.35" dur="4.86">maybe with a nuclear exchange or some</text><text start="2008.08" dur="4.68">sort of synthetic biology who knows what</text><text start="2010.21" dur="5.189">where there are survivors but it&apos;s not</text><text start="2012.76" dur="4.409">it&apos;s not the world that we see at our</text><text start="2015.399" dur="4.591">window here then there&apos;s another one</text><text start="2017.169" dur="6.181">which says maybe we managed to trundle</text><text start="2019.99" dur="6.21">on for another thousand years</text><text start="2023.35" dur="5.04">somehow limping along without any major</text><text start="2026.2" dur="4.829">new ideas we&apos;re still using markets</text><text start="2028.39" dur="4.289">there&apos;s the decadent option things are</text><text start="2031.029" dur="4.14">getting incrementally better maybe there</text><text start="2032.679" dur="4.411">some big breakthroughs here and there</text><text start="2035.169" dur="4.531">but there&apos;s no big

there&apos;s no broad collapse then</text><text start="2049.659" dur="4.71">there&apos;s an escape branch where we we end</text><text start="2052.33" dur="3.99">up on Mars or maybe we escape even</text><text start="2054.369" dur="4.141">farther out in the universe or maybe we</text><text start="2056.32" dur="5.339">get uploaded into silicon there&apos;s no</text><text start="2058.51"

is</text><text start="2083.76" dur="5.649">especially when you look at the decadent</text><text start="2086.02" dur="5.94">option because you know essentially what</text><text start="2089.409"

dur="5.85">books basically by religious the</text><text start="2652.58" dur="3.93">religious tracking systems have been the</text><text start="2654.71" dur="4.79">tracking systems we have used and again</text><text start="2656.51" dur="5.37">in many ways this goes back to I think</text><text start="2659.5" dur="5.86">what was at the heart of Jordan</text><text start="2661.88" dur="6.27">Peterson&apos;s agenda there there there&apos;s of</text><text start="2665.36" dur="4.54">course new religions all the time and so</text><text start="2668.15" dur="4.96">the woke religion has been a</text><text start="2669.9" dur="6.06">religion but it&apos;s it&apos;s a dead end and</text><text start="2673.11" dur="4.74">and again this critic of this the</text><text start="2675.96" dur="3.27">feminist case for Jordan Peterson that I</text><text start="2677.85" dur="4.29">mentioned for many young people</text><text start="2679.23" dur="4.77">Peterson&apos;s message is startling they</text><text start="2682.14" dur="3.69">have been presented with awoke political</text><text start="2684.0" dur="3.84">narrative that views human suffering as</text><text start="2685.83" dur="5.55">the result of an unequal distribution of</text><text start="2687.84" dur="5.34">power that&apos;s certainly true with those</text><text start="2691.38" dur="3.51">that top of the hierarchy abusing those</text><text start="2693.18" dur="5.04">at the bottom for their own gain well</text><text start="2694.89" dur="5.49">that&apos;s certainly true what they don&apos;t</text><text start="2698.22" dur="4.08">understand is that the germ that&apos;s</text><text start="2700.38" dur="3.51">inside all the people with power and the</text><text start="2702.3" dur="4.89">people with wealth is inside everybody</text><text start="2703.89" dur="5.67">else and something needs to die and</text><text start="2707.19" dur="7.14">again if you realize that well where did</text><text start="2709.56" dur="9.96">that idea come from well you see it in</text><text start="2714.33" dur="9.54">the image of someone on a cross who by</text><text start="2719.52" dur="7.02">virtue of his assertion has absolutely</text><text start="2723.87" dur="5.55">everything Son of Man and Son of God and</text><text start="2726.54" dur="6.51">comes down and makes himself nothing</text><text start="2729.42" dur="7.2">Philippians chapter 2 and and and we all</text><text start="2733.05" dur="6.96">get that but we can&apos;t all do that why</text><text start="2736.62" dur="4.95">and and again if you someone looking in</text><text start="2740.01" dur="4.92">from the outside would say this all</text><text start="2741.57" dur="6.21">sounds just like Christianity with the</text><text start="2744.93" dur="5.31">division but but again don&apos;t don&apos;t get</text><text start="2747.78" dur="4.65">me wrong I think doubt it&apos;s dead-on</text><text start="2750.24" dur="5.7">right that the church is decadent not</text><text start="2752.43" dur="5.04">just the Roman Catholic Church and you</text><text start="2755.94" dur="4.47">know part of what&apos;s interesting about</text><text start="2757.47" dur="5.28">the the Orthodox Renaissance in the</text><text start="2760.41" dur="4.56">Americas it&apos;s it&apos;s sort of their turn</text><text start="2762.75" dur="4.44">the Roman Catholics had a renaissance</text><text start="2764.97" dur="3.81">when it came to America and and I think</text><text start="2767.19" dur="3.27">the Orthodox are having it now the</text><text start="2768.78" dur="4.23">Protestants got here first so perhaps</text><text start="2770.46" dur="6.09">we&apos;re the most decadent of all and and</text><text start="2773.01" dur="5.91">that&apos;s why well with the the quite</text><text start="2776.55" dur="4.8">likely the you know Protestant decadence</text><text start="2778.92" dur="5.07">reached its peak during the Cold War</text><text start="2781.35" dur="4.95">if only power could be removed from</text><text start="2783.99" dur="4.14">these people the story goes then we</text><text start="2786.3" dur="5.25">could arrive at the kingdom of heaven on</text><text start="2788.13" dur="7.79">earth except that new people have power</text><text start="2791.55" dur="6.75">and so the whole thing starts over again</text><text start="2795.92" dur="4.33">Peterson says otherwise he insists that</text><text start="2798.3" dur="4.2">suffering is our lot as human beings and</text><text start="2800.25" dur="3.42">hierarchies are inevitable part of that</text><text start="2802.5" dur="3.21">and so for Peters</text><text start="2803.67" dur="6.389">it&apos;s the striving up the hill but you</text><text start="2805.71" dur="6.659">never get to the top because it&apos;s in the</text><text start="2810.059" dur="6.691">striving that you partake of the</text><text start="2812.369"

dur="4.38">of now and that has to be done in a</text><text start="3047.09" dur="6.0">rigorous way and my argument that I&apos;ve</text><text start="3049.43" dur="6.9">made often in videos about Brett

dur="7.5">this is exactly the project of religion</text><text start="3062.78" dur="7.02">and it&apos;s why you you hold a book up high</text><text start="3066.44" dur="4.41">and you do that intention now again to</text><text start="3069.8" dur="3.12">the</text><text start="3070.85" dur="4.41">the silly arguments I hear coming from</text><text start="3072.92" dur="5.01">the likes of Sam Harris you don&apos;t have</text><text start="3075.26" dur="4.05">Christians holding slaves you and and</text><text start="3077.93" dur="3.66">what you find in religious communities</text><text start="3079.31" dur="5.52">like Christianity is you have the</text><text start="3081.59" dur="5.19">Orthodox who are deeply conservative you</text><text start="3084.83" dur="4.92">have the Roman Catholic who are very</text><text start="3086.78" dur="5.13">conservative but both managing change</text><text start="3089.75" dur="5.1">within their institutions the</text><text start="3091.91" dur="4.88">Protestants

the</text><text start="3101.57" dur="4.5">the enormous blindside of the</text><text start="3103.97" dur="4.26">intellectual dark web which for me seems</text><text start="3106.07" dur="5.75">to be the the group that is really</text><text start="3108.23" dur="7.86">earnestly trying to wrestle with this is</text><text start="3111.82" dur="7.48">their complete their near complete</text><text start="3116.09" dur="5.91">indifference to religious conversation</text><text start="3119.3" dur="6.36">and again I understand</text><text start="3122.0" dur="6.66">the decadence is is is frightful Douthit</text><text start="3125.66" dur="5.16">makes that point but here we are and and</text><text start="3128.66" dur="4.29">and what we&apos;re basically doing is</text><text start="3130.82" dur="4.38">religion so you might as well talk to</text><text start="3132.95" dur="5.16">some people who actually have some lived</text><text start="3135.2" dur="5.43">experience in it now I&apos;m not advocating</text><text start="3138.11" dur="4.74">for myself and people are like well you</text><text start="3140.63" dur="4.38">should get on Eric show I don&apos;t know if</text><text start="3142.85" dur="4.86">that conversation would go well or not</text><text start="3145.01" dur="5.01">because one of the things that is true</text><text start="3147.71" dur="4.59">about conversations is it takes a long</text><text start="3150.02" dur="6.86">time and I think one of the things that</text><text start="3152.3" dur="8.25">Peterson did was he at least via young</text><text start="3156.88" dur="7.68">took religion seriously and I still</text><text start="3160.55" dur="6.81">think that&apos;s part of the reason why his</text><text start="3164.56" dur="4.39">contributions were outstanding now why</text><text start="3167.36" dur="3.93">do I say his contributions were</text><text start="3168.95" dur="4.11">outstanding because even though Brett</text><text start="3171.29" dur="3.89">and Eric are making noise and have</text><text start="3173.06" dur="6.68">developed something of a following</text><text start="3175.18" dur="9.01">Jordan put a whoosh through the culture</text><text start="3179.74" dur="7.48">that&apos;s important and and and and I don&apos;t</text><text start="3184.19" dur="6.33">expect to see any similar whoosh from</text><text start="3187.22" dur="5.97">Brett or Eric and and Brett and Eric are</text><text start="3190.52" dur="3.9">about as smart as you can find a</text><text start="3193.19" dur="3.63">beginner I&apos;ll tell you I listen this</text><text start="3194.42" dur="8.7">guy&apos;s is like holy cow these guys are</text><text start="3196.82" dur="10.08">brilliant but it isn&apos;t just intelligence</text><text start="3203.12" dur="7.68">it&apos;s a whole life and and in some ways</text><text start="3206.9" dur="6.12">you know that&apos;s what Jordans been doing</text><text start="3210.8" dur="3.93">so at least Jordan is openness to</text><text start="3213.02" dur="5.82">religion I think it&apos;s part of the reason</text><text start="3214.73" dur="7.34">he was able to to make the whoosh that</text><text start="3218.84" dur="6.42">the others haven&apos;t been able to make</text><text start="3222.07" dur="5.83">back again about theology you need a</text><text start="3225.26" dur="5.97">fixed point if the kite is going to fly</text><text start="3227.9" dur="5.91">you need a fixed ruler if you&apos;re going</text><text start="3231.23" dur="6.21">to be able to notice progress and I</text><text start="3233.81" dur="5.79">think Douthit is helpful because at</text><text start="3237.44" dur="4.35">least Douthit knows religion now he has</text><text start="3239.6" dur="5.34">sufficient status that you know maybe</text><text start="3241.79" dur="7.23">I&apos;ll put my two cents in probably Brett</text><text start="3244.94" dur="5.34">and Ross should talk because they might</text><text start="3249.02" dur="3.81">be able to have a productive</text><text start="3250.28" dur="5.25">conversation the thing is we need</text><text start="3252.83" dur="6.45">analogies and so you know one of the</text><text start="3255.53" dur="7.32">things that I&apos;ve said about the age to</text><text start="3259.28" dur="5.79">come is you know streets of gold no more</text><text start="3262.85" dur="3.6">tears you find them in Isaiah you find</text><text start="3265.07" dur="3.42">them in Revelation you&apos;ll find them</text><text start="3266.45" dur="3.66">scattered in a few other places and then</text><text start="3268.49" dur="4.71">like I was talking with with Brett</text><text start="3270.11" dur="5.04">shackled you need analogies you can&apos;t</text><text start="3273.2" dur="5.67">work without analogies but all are</text><text start="3275.15" dur="6.3">analogies fall short and and so what</text><text start="3278.87" dur="4.2">what happens then in decadence is so if</text><text start="3281.45" dur="4.26">you look at this little image that I</text><text start="3283.07" dur="5.55">grabbed I did my zeitgeist check me</text><text start="3285.71" dur="4.49">agooo GLE Google Images you know you</text><text start="3288.62" dur="8.49">just search an image you just search and</text><text start="3290.2" dur="9.97">searching a non-material concept and see</text><text start="3297.11" dur="5.88">what images come up and oh here you are</text><text start="3300.17" dur="5.7">it&apos;s it&apos;s the emerald

start="3308.15" dur="6.24">read the book of Revelation it looks</text><text start="3309.5" dur="7.35">more like a Borg cube we need analogies</text><text start="3314.39" dur="5.43">but our analogies fall short and and and</text><text start="3316.85" dur="6.06">in some ways the pictures we draw mark</text><text start="3319.82" dur="7.38">the limit of our imagination of our</text><text

and it&apos;s like well when</text><text start="3470.53" dur="5.49">when when theologians bumped into that</text><text start="3472.99" dur="5.85">problem God was the answer and it was</text><text start="3476.02" dur="4.86">often a fuzzy answer but but God in a</text><text start="3478.84" dur="5.67">sense was the idea that made all the</text><text start="3480.88" dur="5.61">equations balance and and and so you</text><text start="3484.51" dur="5.64">know certainly there is a God of the</text><text start="3486.49" dur="6.98">gaps problem inherent in there but but</text><text start="3490.15" dur="6.69">at least the equations balanced and so</text><text start="3493.47" dur="7.09">this is where progress has to move</text><text start="3496.84" dur="6.09">forward and we have limits like my cat</text><text start="3500.56" dur="4.92">has limits of imagination we can&apos;t</text><text start="3502.93" dur="5.13">imagine anything better because we</text><text start="3505.48"
