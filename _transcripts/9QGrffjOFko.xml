dur="3.421">I&apos;m not gonna try and repeat any of the</text><text start="17.3" dur="4.41">ideas that air people can check it out</text><text start="18.98" dur="5.07">if they haven&apos;t already and the the gist</text><text start="21.71" dur="5.49">of it was explaining some principles of</text><text start="24.05" dur="4.77">how propaganda works and how kind of</text><text start="27.2" dur="4.98">narrative warfare works and whether</text><text start="28.82" dur="5.1">we&apos;re talking about through political</text><text start="32.18" dur="3.87">process which we normally think of as</text><text start="33.92" dur="3.659">propaganda or campaigning or through</text><text start="36.05" dur="3.72">commercial process which we think of as</text><text start="37.579" dur="4.771">marketing or the intersection of those</text><text start="39.77" dur="6.39">things or you know social movements</text><text start="42.35" dur="5.64">which are basically movements that have</text><text start="46.16" dur="3.72">some agenda that are trying to gain some</text><text start="47.99" dur="3.96">kind of differential power that end up</text><text start="49.88" dur="3.6">using narratives that coalesce people to</text><text start="51.95" dur="3.93">support them and use information that</text><text start="53.48" dur="4.95">coalesce as people to support them but</text><text start="55.88" dur="4.8">where there ends up being distortions in</text><text start="58.43" dur="4.29">the narrative and the information to</text><text start="60.68" dur="5.49">support some agenda right and we kind of</text><text start="62.72" dur="4.77">discussed how Vick witness that is and</text><text start="66.17" dur="5.04">how it happens and how social media</text><text start="67.49" dur="5.94">makes it the social media and broadcasts</text><text start="71.21" dur="5.19">and all those technologies increase the</text><text start="73.43" dur="6.5">capacity to do that</text><text start="76.4" dur="6.48">and there&apos;s a lot on that and I think</text><text start="79.93" dur="5.41">before people can do good sense-making</text><text start="82.88" dur="4.59">may be one of the prerequisites is that</text><text start="85.34" dur="4.139">before people can really focus on what</text><text start="87.47" dur="4.5">our true beliefs and how do they know</text><text start="89.479" dur="4.891">what a true belief is they have to make</text><text start="91.97" dur="4.89">sure that they aren&apos;t being compelled to</text><text start="94.37" dur="4.02">believe not true or very partial things</text><text start="96.86" dur="5.34">as being less partial or more</text><text start="98.39" dur="5.37">representative than they are and so the</text><text start="102.2" dur="5.279">goal of that piece was to kind of</text><text start="103.76" dur="5.34">inoculate people against propaganda so</text><text start="107.479" dur="5.611">that when it was happening they would at</text><text start="109.1" dur="7.559">least recognize it and so because if</text><text start="113.09" dur="5.37">someone holds false beliefs or holds</text><text start="116.659" dur="5.191">true beliefs but that are very partial</text><text start="118.46" dur="5.339">were held as more complete again in that</text><text start="121.85" dur="3.69">being very distorted if someone holds</text><text start="123.799" dur="3.75">distorted worldviews and then they try</text><text start="125.54" dur="3.869">and do logic factoring those things as</text><text start="127.549" dur="5.211">true everything else will be affected by</text><text start="129.409" dur="5.311">distortion so not holding false or</text><text start="132.76" dur="3.61">misrepresented beliefs or ideas is</text><text start="134.72" dur="3.419">really fundamental to being able to do</text><text start="136.37" dur="4.17">sense making and I think what we&apos;re</text><text start="138.139" dur="3.641">wanting to talk about here is the next</text><text start="140.54" dur="3.07">step in giving people to</text><text start="141.78" dur="4.83">fools to notice we&apos;re distortion is</text><text start="143.61" dur="5.01">occurring to again further inoculate</text><text start="146.61" dur="3.93">their sense making against distortion</text><text start="148.62" dur="4.53">and also recognize when they are a</text><text start="150.54" dur="4.68">source of distortion in the information</text><text start="153.15" dur="3.87">ecology when they are actually engaging</text><text start="155.22" dur="5.37">in some form of narrative warfare maybe</text><text start="157.02" dur="5.75">without having done it the reason this</text><text start="160.59" dur="4.74">came up is you and I talked about was</text><text start="162.77" dur="4.27">you know we&apos;re we&apos;re watching the</text><text start="165.33" dur="3.27">comments and watching the shares and</text><text start="167.04" dur="3.18">then watching in various groups where</text><text start="168.6" dur="3.359">people are discussing some of the ideas</text><text start="170.22" dur="3.78">and of course the fact that some people</text><text start="171.959" dur="3.75">resonated was great that some people</text><text start="174.0" dur="5.28">agreed or disagreed or whatever all</text><text start="175.709" dur="8.101">that&apos;s fine but I was witnessing places</text><text start="179.28" dur="6.63">where people were taking ideas about how</text><text start="183.81" dur="3.87">the information ecology is broken and</text><text start="185.91" dur="4.95">using them in ways that further broke</text><text start="187.68" dur="5.22">the information ecology they were you</text><text start="190.86" dur="4.83">know like it&apos;s very easy to recognize</text><text start="192.9" dur="5.55">that some news is to some degree fake</text><text start="195.69" dur="4.769">and then assume or make the story that</text><text start="198.45" dur="4.2">it&apos;s the other side that has all fake</text><text start="200.459" dur="3.81">news right which is now basically a fake</text><text start="202.65" dur="4.11">news strategy or a narrative warfare</text><text start="204.269" dur="3.871">strategy itself against the other guy</text><text start="206.76" dur="3.18">because as soon as you see that the</text><text start="208.14" dur="5.01">other guy the other side whatever it is</text><text start="209.94" dur="4.47">is using information as a weapon then</text><text start="213.15" dur="3.54">you can use the fact that they&apos;re using</text><text start="214.41" dur="4.98">information as a weapon as a weapon</text><text start="216.69" dur="4.47">itself to engage in that process and we</text><text start="219.39" dur="3.3">started seeing this happen and started</text><text start="221.16" dur="6.24">seeing like even in the comment thread</text><text start="222.69" dur="7.139">where people&apos;s responses were not really</text><text start="227.4" dur="4.14">seeking to understand and engage in a</text><text start="229.829" dur="3.301">process of deeper understanding they</text><text start="231.54" dur="3.72">were seeking something else which was</text><text start="233.13" dur="5.63">how to launch counter responses that</text><text start="235.26" dur="5.849">would either get likes or seem smart or</text><text start="238.76" dur="5.14">position them securely at the center of</text><text start="241.109" dur="6.181">their in-group or you know whatever it</text><text start="243.9" dur="6.66">is and so and it wasn&apos;t just that video</text><text start="247.29" dur="10.289">it was like you know I actually feel</text><text start="250.56" dur="12.83">kind of an ethical culpability and any</text><text start="257.579" dur="7.921">public sharing of tools right</text><text start="263.39" dur="4.39">metaphysical tools knowledge tools so</text><text start="265.5" dur="4.47">whether it is a psychological principle</text><text start="267.78" dur="5.52">or an insight or a cognitive or an</text><text start="269.97" dur="5.44">epistemic tool or like a sense making or</text><text start="273.3" dur="8.14">frameworks kind of process or</text><text start="275.41" dur="8.73">or or a virtue or a narrative that those</text><text start="281.44" dur="4.08">tools can be weaponized and especially</text><text start="284.14" dur="2.79">in the context where almost everything</text><text start="285.52" dur="2.85">is being weaponized because everybody</text><text start="286.93" dur="4.62">feels like they&apos;re at war of some kind</text><text start="288.37" dur="4.44">then what I don&apos;t want to be doing and</text><text start="291.55" dur="3.3">what I know you don&apos;t want to be doing</text><text start="292.81" dur="4.59">as you know with rebel wisdom is</text><text start="294.85" dur="4.29">actually in the name of addressing</text><text start="297.4" dur="4.05">culture wars to try and heal them and</text><text start="299.14" dur="4.74">bringing thoughtful smart insightful</text><text start="301.45" dur="4.32">people on something like rebel wisdom to</text><text start="303.88" dur="4.77">share insights that those insights get</text><text start="305.77" dur="5.18">taken in some distorted way and used to</text><text start="308.65" dur="4.95">further culture war and so they&apos;re</text><text start="310.95" dur="5.35">wanting to really address basically how</text><text start="313.6" dur="5.22">all ideas can be weaponized all true</text><text start="316.3" dur="4.71">ideas can be used for distorted purposes</text><text start="318.82" dur="6.09">and to show how acquiesce that is and to</text><text start="321.01" dur="6.63">show how almost every idea can be</text><text start="324.91" dur="4.98">weaponized in multiple directions there</text><text start="327.64" dur="4.89">can be a pro and con case against almost</text><text start="329.89" dur="3.96">any idea any virtue whatever and the</text><text start="332.53" dur="3.78">reason I want to share this is so that</text><text start="333.85" dur="7.98">people notice it when it&apos;s happening in</text><text start="336.31" dur="10.8">other people and in themselves and so</text><text start="341.83" dur="8.4">like this video is useful only if people</text><text start="347.11" dur="5.73">are actually interested in trying to</text><text start="350.23" dur="6.09">make better sense of the world like</text><text start="352.84" dur="5.88">actually hold more clear beliefs about</text><text start="356.32" dur="5.52">the nature of ground reality and to</text><text start="358.72" dur="5.49">engage in earnest and in good faith with</text><text start="361.84" dur="6.12">others to share sense making towards</text><text start="364.21" dur="6.57">being able to make better choices to</text><text start="367.96" dur="6.6">make a better world if someone is simply</text><text start="370.78" dur="5.67">wanting to make sure their agenda wins</text><text start="374.56" dur="3.12">whatever that agenda happens to be that</text><text start="376.45" dur="4.47">they&apos;re already sure enough that they&apos;re</text><text start="377.68" dur="7.08">right about then all of this will not be</text><text start="380.92" dur="6.66">that helpful it except insofar as it can</text><text start="384.76" dur="5.58">be weaponized so it&apos;s kind of the</text><text start="387.58" dur="6.45">paradox that we spoke a lot in the last</text><text start="390.34" dur="6.57">film about a more ethical and more</text><text start="394.03" dur="5.76">grounded and more truthful sense making</text><text start="396.91" dur="6.509">but even that language itself can be</text><text start="399.79" dur="7.92">used for it can be weaponized and used</text><text start="403.419" dur="6.451">for what pathological ends basically</text><text start="407.71" dur="5.94">yeah when I you know pathological is a</text><text start="409.87" dur="6.06">strong word and so I kind of want to</text><text start="413.65" dur="4.859">speak to that self-serving is that</text><text start="415.93" dur="5.19">better what self-serving is good and</text><text start="418.509" dur="5.041">that ends up being pathological for the</text><text start="421.12" dur="4.71">whole we&apos;re self-serving leads to</text><text start="423.55" dur="6.53">different types of conflicts between</text><text start="425.83" dur="4.25">cells and between selves and Commons</text><text start="430.41" dur="7.27">then that ends up being pathological to</text><text start="433.18" dur="8.01">a larger scale right and oftentimes</text><text start="437.68" dur="5.37">people don&apos;t don&apos;t think they are</text><text start="441.19" dur="3.78">engaging in a self-serving way they</text><text start="443.05" dur="4.29">think they are engaging in a way that is</text><text start="444.97" dur="4.08">good for the world as they understand</text><text start="447.34" dur="4.65">and as their in-group holds and</text><text start="449.05" dur="4.92">understands and it&apos;s hard for them to</text><text start="451.99" dur="3.739">think about engaging in good faith with</text><text start="453.97" dur="3.75">people that they think are bad and</text><text start="455.729" dur="4.931">basically hurting what they care about</text><text start="457.72" dur="4.47">so if people on the Left think that</text><text start="460.66" dur="4.129">climate change is about to make the</text><text start="462.19" dur="5.039">entire planet uninhabitable and caused</text><text start="464.789" dur="5.231">massive and irreversible existential</text><text start="467.229" dur="4.171">risk and that as a result anyone on the</text><text start="470.02" dur="6.36">right that doesn&apos;t think that that&apos;s a</text><text start="471.4" dur="6.6">climate denier is basically killing</text><text start="476.38" dur="2.849">everything running the risk of killing</text><text start="478.0" dur="3.78">everything their kids their grandkids</text><text start="479.229" dur="4.231">them like the the true the good and the</text><text start="481.78" dur="3.75">beautiful the right is actively seeking</text><text start="483.46" dur="3.51">to her they&apos;re not trying to understand</text><text start="485.53" dur="3.18">them or engage in good faith they&apos;re</text><text start="486.97" dur="4.189">just trying to win because those guys</text><text start="488.71" dur="5.1">are clearly wrong and bad right and</text><text start="491.159" dur="6.1">similarly if you&apos;re on the right and you</text><text start="493.81" dur="5.789">see that the left is trying to destroy</text><text start="497.259" dur="6.0">the traditions that you hold as what has</text><text start="499.599" dur="5.731">actually made it through the trials of</text><text start="503.259" dur="4.761">history that actually works and is good</text><text start="505.33" dur="5.519">and is trying to basically destroy the</text><text start="508.02" dur="5.29">what you&apos;re trying to conserve which is</text><text start="510.849" dur="5.73">what was true and good and beautiful you</text><text start="513.31" dur="4.979">believe that their science is distorted</text><text start="516.579" dur="3.9">and etc then simile you&apos;re not trying to</text><text start="518.289" dur="5.071">engage in good faith so for the most</text><text start="520.479" dur="5.821">part I don&apos;t think that people think</text><text start="523.36" dur="5.61">they&apos;re engaging in bad faith or they</text><text start="526.3" dur="7.72">think they&apos;re self-serving they&apos;re just</text><text start="528.97" dur="15.19">over certain about perspectives that are</text><text start="534.02" dur="13.08">under complete the line that separates</text><text start="544.16" dur="6.09">tools and weapons is not a clear line</text><text start="547.1" dur="4.95">it&apos;s very fuzzy so let&apos;s think about</text><text start="550.25" dur="8.43">physical tools and physical weapons for</text><text start="552.05" dur="12.45">a moment a weapon is a tool to</text><text start="558.68" dur="13.08">accomplish a goal in a adversarial</text><text start="564.5" dur="8.88">context a tool is basically some kind of</text><text start="571.76" dur="3.93">tech name kind of invention to</text><text start="573.38" dur="4.769">accomplish some kind of goal maybe or</text><text start="575.69" dur="4.38">maybe not in an adversarial context we</text><text start="578.149" dur="4.291">can see that most any tool that was</text><text start="580.07" dur="4.16">developed for a knot weapon purpose</text><text start="582.44" dur="6.149">could be weaponized if it needed to be</text><text start="584.23" dur="6.58">so the kitchen cutting knife is a tool</text><text start="588.589" dur="3.511">that is obviously to prepare food in the</text><text start="590.81" dur="2.82">kitchen but it could be weaponized if</text><text start="592.1" dur="3.66">one needed it too and so could a hammer</text><text start="593.63" dur="4.829">and so could a screwdriver and so could</text><text start="595.76" dur="5.79">a chainsaw and so could a car right so</text><text start="598.459" dur="5.88">could my laptop if I needed it to be and</text><text start="601.55" dur="6.0">so we can see that pretty much any tool</text><text start="604.339" dur="4.771">can be made into a weapon actually I&apos;m</text><text start="607.55" dur="4.95">not positive but I think the term</text><text start="609.11" dur="5.28">weaponized which is now like one of the</text><text start="612.5" dur="3.18">most common terms and I think it&apos;s</text><text start="614.39" dur="3.6">important to understand why it&apos;s so</text><text start="615.68" dur="4.74">common but very rarely does anyone say</text><text start="617.99" dur="4.32">we&apos;re weaponizing stuff they typically</text><text start="620.42" dur="4.58">say why someone of another group is</text><text start="622.31" dur="9.36">weaponizing things and what we&apos;ll see is</text><text start="625.0" dur="8.92">like the exact same thing the same topic</text><text start="631.67" dur="3.87">two different groups will say the other</text><text start="633.92" dur="8.909">group is weaponizing a version of it</text><text start="635.54" dur="9.299">right but you know weaponizing safe</text><text start="642.829" dur="4.891">space and vulnerability and whatever on</text><text start="644.839" dur="4.5">the left side versus weaponizing free</text><text start="647.72" dur="4.17">speech to just do hate speech on the</text><text start="649.339" dur="4.651">right side right that kind of debate I</text><text start="651.89" dur="3.72">think that the term weaponized was</text><text start="653.99" dur="4.98">actually coined or at least popularized</text><text start="655.61" dur="6.0">in recent time after World War two by</text><text start="658.97" dur="4.44">Wernher von Braun the Nazi rocket</text><text start="661.61" dur="4.11">scientists that we brought to the US to</text><text start="663.41" dur="4.09">lead a lot of our rocket and also ICBM</text><text start="665.72" dur="4.63">work and the Apollo project</text><text start="667.5" dur="5.01">he was talking about taking the rocketry</text><text start="670.35" dur="3.42">capabilities and things like Apollo and</text><text start="672.51" dur="5.31">being able to weaponize them by adding</text><text start="673.77" dur="5.52">nukes to him and so that was basically</text><text start="677.82" dur="3.54">take a tool there&apos;s not a weapon and</text><text start="679.29" dur="3.75">learn how to weaponize it and in the</text><text start="681.36" dur="3.77">physical domain we can see that anything</text><text start="683.04" dur="6.54">can be used as a weapon the same is true</text><text start="685.13" dur="6.34">with metaphysical tools so psychological</text><text start="689.58" dur="4.26">tools tools that can actually help shift</text><text start="691.47" dur="5.85">people&apos;s psychology or cognitive tools</text><text start="693.84" dur="5.52">tools for sense making or communication</text><text start="697.32" dur="5.82">tools right tools to be able to create</text><text start="699.36" dur="6.18">rapport or to be able to influence of</text><text start="703.14" dur="6.21">other people&apos;s thought all of these and</text><text start="705.54" dur="4.59">even tools or principles or insights of</text><text start="709.35" dur="3.72">good behavior</text><text start="710.13" dur="7.68">ie virtues or morals all of these can be</text><text start="713.07" dur="6.45">used to advance some agenda in a way</text><text start="717.81" dur="3.87">that has some distortion and that</text><text start="719.52" dur="5.76">creates some harm that&apos;s how I&apos;m going</text><text start="721.68" dur="5.19">to define weaponize and you know maybe</text><text start="725.28" dur="3.33">that some of the way we can start to</text><text start="726.87" dur="4.08">think about the demarcation between tool</text><text start="728.61" dur="4.79">and weapon is that a weapon is going to</text><text start="730.95" dur="5.13">be causing harm if it is deployed and</text><text start="733.4" dur="7.03">that if it&apos;s not deployed and it&apos;s</text><text start="736.08" dur="6.81">basically being used to avoid violence</text><text start="740.43" dur="4.5">by saying we can commit violence right</text><text start="742.89"

dur="4.651">the capacity of our choice is</text><text start="818.17" dur="4.44">evolutionarily unprecedented because of</text><text start="820.99" dur="3.42">our tool making capacity and

dur="6.57">Rosling like there&apos;s a whole kind of</text><text start="966.76" dur="7.87">underlying thinking and so when you when</text><text start="969.98" dur="8.01">you see statistics quoted by Hans or</text><text start="974.63" dur="4.86">John Mackey or whatever that say the</text><text start="977.99" dur="7.02">world is doing better than it&apos;s ever</text><text start="979.49"

dur="4.71">better quality of life for everyone well</text><text start="995.63" dur="4.92">that might actually be a true statistic</text><text start="997.67" dur="4.14">that it went from 60 people to 18</text><text start="1000.55" dur="2.58">percent of people or something I forget</text><text start="1001.81" dur="3.68">what the exact statistic is that might</text><text start="1003.13" dur="4.17">be a true statistic but that is</text><text start="1005.49" dur="3.7">misrepresentative in some really</text><text start="1007.3" dur="3.96">important ways taken out of context that</text><text start="1009.19" dur="3.48">in 1850 people&apos;s lives were mediated</text><text start="1011.26" dur="3.41">largely not by dollars a lot of those</text><text start="1012.67" dur="4.53">people who they were talking about were</text><text start="1014.67" dur="4.51">lived in log cabins that they made</text><text start="1017.2" dur="6.12">themselves not mediated by dollars and</text><text start="1019.18" dur="6.899">grew their own food and so the idea that</text><text start="1023.32" dur="6.09">dollars mediated their life actually is</text><text start="1026.079" dur="5.901">not a good representation of economic</text><text start="1029.41" dur="5.789">quality of life nor is the fact that now</text><text start="1031.98" dur="6.64">obesity which is mediated by you know</text><text start="1035.199" dur="5.73">more dollars is a radical cause of life</text><text start="1038.62" dur="4.29">expectancy challenges and all kinds of</text><text start="1040.929" dur="3.541">psychological and physical issues and</text><text start="1042.91" dur="4.71">kind of rampant a new BIC witness and</text><text start="1044.47" dur="4.98">you know when the story comes that there</text><text start="1047.62" dur="4.53">the world has always had violence and</text><text start="1049.45" dur="5.25">we&apos;re less violent now well kind of like</text><text start="1052.15" dur="4.71">we&apos;re in a fairly short period of having</text><text start="1054.7" dur="5.01">to be less violent of certain kinds</text><text start="1056.86" dur="5.22">after developing the bomb but now the</text><text start="1059.71" dur="4.59">the Bretton Woods convention that</text><text start="1062.08" dur="5.67">mediated that has almost completely</text><text start="1064.3" dur="6.24">broken

force</text><text start="1073.09" dur="3.54">nash equilibrium like meets you sure</text><text start="1074.59" dur="3.57">destruction isn&apos;t even possible the</text><text start="1076.63" dur="5.64">tensions in the situation are heat</text><text start="1078.16" dur="6.66">heating and yeah we never had weaponized</text><text start="1082.27" dur="5.67">AI drones before right we didn&apos;t have</text><text start="1084.82" dur="5.16">CRISPR based bio weapon so like the fact</text><text start="1087.94" dur="4.35">that there might be less violence of</text><text start="1089.98" dur="3.78">some kinds at the moment but radically</text><text start="1092.29" dur="4.05">more violence capacity and less ability</text><text start="1093.76" dur="4.26">to do anything effective towards it</text><text start="1096.34" dur="4.02">while orienting more towards it is a</text><text start="1098.02" dur="4.14">stat that&apos;s not being or a it&apos;s not a</text><text start="1100.36" dur="4.2">stat you can&apos;t even make a proper stat</text><text start="1102.16" dur="4.71">on it it&apos;s a trendline that isn&apos;t being</text><text start="1104.56" dur="4.44">paid attention to nor is the radical</text><text start="1106.87" dur="4.08">amounts of species extinction or coral</text><text start="1109.0" dur="4.56">bleaching or micro plastics in the ocean</text><text start="1110.95" dur="6.6">or rampant addiction rates or etc so I</text><text start="1113.56" dur="5.67">can take a true statistic out of context</text><text start="1117.55" dur="4.32">of all the things to assess and say</text><text start="1119.23" dur="3.93">quality of life is getting better I can</text><text start="1121.87" dur="3.87">take another true statistic and say</text><text start="1123.16" dur="4.26">quality of life is getting worse I can</text><text start="1125.74" dur="3.45">group some group of those statistics</text><text start="1127.42" dur="3.33">together to make a compelling argument</text><text start="1129.19" dur="4.29">with a book on either side</text><text start="1130.75" dur="5.67">and neither of them are representative</text><text start="1133.48" dur="7.2">of the whole picture and so something</text><text start="1136.42" dur="9.84">can be true in isolation but it is way</text><text start="1140.68" dur="8.64">too reductive and as a result is if</text><text start="1146.26" dur="5.91">shared as representative and isn&apos;t is</text><text start="1149.32" dur="5.15">actually a weapon to convince a</text><text start="1152.17" dur="6.6">narrative that is not actually a</text><text start="1154.47" dur="6.25">reasonable narrative and so this is</text><text start="1158.77" dur="4.23">where I would say you know like when we</text><text start="1160.72" dur="5.22">look at climate change we have kind of</text><text start="1163.0" dur="5.79">like a Greta versus Trump narrative</text><text start="1165.94" dur="6.27">warfare on climate change right and we</text><text start="1168.79" dur="4.62">have people see letters circulating on</text><text start="1172.21" dur="3.81">Facebook depending upon which side</text><text start="1173.41" dur="4.83">they&apos;re on that&apos;s a X number of</text><text start="1176.02" dur="3.87">X percentage of scientists all agree</text><text start="1178.24" dur="3.09">that climate change is real and both on</text><text start="1179.89" dur="4.2">the only ones who think otherwise are</text><text start="1181.33" dur="4.35">paid by oil companies and then also X</text><text start="1184.09" dur="3.54">number of thousands of scientists say</text><text start="1185.68" dur="3.51">the Clinton the IPCC climate change</text><text start="1187.63" dur="6.05">thing is bunk and there&apos;s other stuff</text><text start="1189.19" dur="8.22">that we need to look at and who actually</text><text start="1193.68" dur="5.41">looks at the science in detail</text><text start="1197.41" dur="3.54">themselves looks at the methodology</text><text start="1199.09" dur="3.3">looks at the models looks at where the</text><text start="1200.95" dur="3.69">funding came from and the sources of</text><text start="1202.39" dur="3.93">bias to actually be able to sense make</text><text start="1204.64" dur="3.48">themselves they just defect to the</text><text start="1206.32" dur="4.08">authority that is most associated with</text><text start="1208.12" dur="5.03">their in-group and the whole thing that</text><text start="1210.4" dur="4.92">ends up being oriented around co2 and</text><text start="1213.15" dur="4.75">either co2 is really a problem or co2</text><text start="1215.32" dur="4.89">isn&apos;t a problem and that framing isn&apos;t</text><text start="1217.9" dur="4.59">even the right conversation because we</text><text start="1220.21" dur="4.53">look at okay what are the arguments for</text><text start="1222.49" dur="3.87">co2 is a problem well there&apos;s arguments</text><text start="1224.74" dur="3.03">about a lot of things but let&apos;s just</text><text start="1226.36" dur="2.61">take for instance coral what&apos;s going to</text><text start="1227.77" dur="1.77">kill the coral that&apos;s gonna kill the</text><text start="1228.97" dur="4.56">oceans</text><text start="1229.54" dur="6.9">well carbonic acid can affect coral</text><text start="1233.53" dur="6.12">that&apos;s true and increased temperature</text><text start="1236.44" dur="5.55">can affect coral that&apos;s true but that</text><text start="1239.65" dur="5.13">doesn&apos;t address nitrogen runoff from you</text><text start="1241.99" dur="4.62">know radical amounts of NPK or other</text><text start="1244.78" dur="3.42">nitrogen based fertilizers are creating</text><text start="1246.61" dur="3.51">nitrogen affluent that causes both dead</text><text start="1248.2" dur="4.08">zones and the oceans and messes up the</text><text start="1250.12" dur="4.92">phosphorous cycle for the coral or</text><text start="1252.28" dur="5.75">having overfished most of the large fish</text><text start="1255.04" dur="5.7">species in the whale that create the</text><text start="1258.03" dur="4.78">trophic cascades from the apex predators</text><text start="1260.74" dur="4.26">that are actually necessary to maintain</text><text start="1262.81" dur="4.11">the coral so again it&apos;s like even if</text><text start="1265.0" dur="3.51">there are some stats about co2 that are</text><text start="1266.92" dur="3.21">true they might not be representative of</text><text start="1268.51" dur="3.03">them of what we&apos;re claiming they&apos;re</text><text start="1270.13" dur="4.11">representative of that it&apos;s actually a</text><text start="1271.54" dur="4.26">multifactorial situation and to try and</text><text start="1274.24" dur="4.59">get something through we think we have</text><text start="1275.8" dur="5.58">to orient it in this particular way and</text><text start="1278.83" dur="5.4">overhype that particular thing now of</text><text start="1281.38" dur="4.8">course I can actually use nitrogen</text><text start="1284.23" dur="3.9">fertilizer to grow more plants that</text><text start="1286.18" dur="4.02">sequester co2 that will actually</text><text start="1288.13"

and so this is</text><text start="1295.96" dur="5.12">an example where it&apos;s like no better</text><text start="1298.6" dur="6.69">sense making actually has to happen and</text><text

dur="3.84">weapon defenses and better versions of</text><text start="1852.48" dur="4.29">that weapon and so this is the thing</text><text start="1854.52" dur="4.14">that when you think like oh

dur="9.22">invoking rule Omega when as a tactic to</text><text start="2214.25" dur="5.28">get other people to include them in a</text><text start="2217.46" dur="4.38">conversation where the the way that they</text><text start="2219.53" dur="6.24">showed up in conversation did not compel</text><text start="2221.84" dur="5.88">the other people to include them and the</text><text start="2225.77" dur="3.87">way we actually articulate rule Omega is</text><text start="2227.72" dur="3.05">that it cannot be invoked by others it</text><text start="2229.64" dur="3.78">has to be granted</text><text start="2230.77" dur="4.81">shall we just recap what rule Omega is</text><text start="2233.42" dur="7.08">it&apos;s basically giving the benefit of the</text><text start="2235.58" dur="6.58">doubt and calling out assuming the other</text><text start="2240.5" dur="4.42">person is trying to express some</text><text start="2242.16" dur="5.13">meaningful and helping to tease that out</text><text start="2244.92" dur="5.73">in the interaction so rather than mixing</text><text start="2247.29" dur="5.25">it yeah and so rule Omega is this kind</text><text start="2250.65" dur="5.82">of process where with those we are</text><text start="2252.54" dur="7.53">seeking to collaborate we grant a level</text><text start="2256.47" dur="6.3">of giving the benefit of the doubt you</text><text start="2260.07" dur="6.27">shouldn&apos;t do this with everyone right</text><text start="2262.77" dur="7.47">like if if somebody comes up to me on</text><text start="2266.34" dur="5.64">the street and they seem like they&apos;re</text><text start="2270.24" dur="4.92">trying to con me in some way I don&apos;t</text><text start="2271.98" dur="5.13">give them Rule megha and assume that</text><text

again</text><text start="2548.65" dur="3.84">these I&apos;m talking about topics that</text><text start="2551.079" dur="3.241">everybody is talking about right now I&apos;m</text><text start="2552.49" dur="3.03">just hopefully trying to talk about them</text><text start="2554.32" dur="4.38">in a slightly different way to say</text><text start="2555.52" dur="5.88">everyone on all sides is are oriented to</text><text start="2558.7" dur="5.55">do versions of this as opposed to those</text><text start="2561.4" dur="5.13">guys are virtue signaling and us calling</text><text start="2564.25" dur="4.13">them out is us demonstrating our actual</text><text start="2566.53" dur="6.03">virtue but we&apos;re not virtue signaling</text><text start="2568.38" dur="6.219">and so one way that I think of the</text><text start="2572.56" dur="6.12">distinction between real virtue and</text><text start="2574.599" dur="7.411">virtue signaling is virtue signaling is</text><text start="2578.68" dur="5.85">when it&apos;s clear that an enough people</text><text start="2582.01" dur="5.37">hold a particular trait as a virtue that</text><text start="2584.53" dur="4.589">if I seem to have that virtue it would</text><text start="2587.38" dur="3.75">be good for me right the people would</text><text start="2589.119" dur="5.011">like me accept me agree with me buy my</text><text start="2591.13" dur="5.459">stuff like my ideas whatever it is so if</text><text start="2594.13" dur="5.699">I signal if I communicate in some way</text><text start="2596.589" dur="5.851">that I have that virtue it&apos;s beneficial</text><text start="2599.829" dur="5.971">for me in straight self-serving ways</text><text start="2602.44" dur="6.36">right so I have a reason to signal the</text><text start="2605.8" dur="5.58">virtue beyond my authentic living of it</text><text start="2608.8" dur="4.279">and this is where rather than I&apos;m just</text><text start="2611.38" dur="5.4">doing what I&apos;m doing and people notice</text><text start="2613.079" dur="6.04">the virtue that I happen to to be living</text><text start="2616.78" dur="4.38">I am intentionally trying to seem</text><text

this is where the you know</text><text start="2626.88" dur="3.88">Jesus saying don&apos;t let the right hand</text><text start="2628.9" dur="3.9">see what the left hand was doing and I</text><text start="2630.76" dur="4.23">think every culture that has wisdom has</text><text start="2632.8" dur="4.5">some quotes like that because virtue</text><text start="2634.99" dur="3.69">signaling has is forever right and it&apos;s</text><text start="2637.3" dur="2.67">whatever the dominant culture is</text><text start="2638.68" dur="2.33">whatever the thing that is seen as</text><text start="2639.97" dur="6.53">virtue there</text><text start="2641.01" dur="9.57">so during you know during the early</text><text start="2646.5" dur="7.13">Soviet empire Marxist ideology people</text><text start="2650.58" dur="4.2">would virtue signal being more Marxist</text><text start="2653.63" dur="4.479">right</text><text start="2654.78" dur="5.18">and during Dark Age Catholic reign the</text><text start="2658.109" dur="5.491">virtuous signaling was about being</text><text start="2659.96" dur="5.409">better Catholics and you know so now</text><text start="2663.6" dur="4.61">left and right have their own versions</text><text start="2665.369" dur="9.451">of virtue signaling to their own base</text><text start="2668.21" dur="9.159">and so politicians and companies and</text><text start="2674.82" dur="3.75">social leaders are oriented to signal</text><text start="2677.369" dur="8.281">the thing they would need to in that way</text><text start="2678.57" dur="10.7">a real virtue is something that is that</text><text start="2685.65" dur="7.49">I care about that I value actually</text><text start="2689.27" dur="7.18">hopefully something that is sacred to me</text><text start="2693.14" dur="6.64">that I am willing to experience personal</text><text start="2696.45" dur="4.68">sacrifice for not that my signalling of</text><text start="2699.78" dur="3.9">it creates personal gain but I am</text><text start="2701.13" dur="4.2">willing to lose personal gain in service</text><text start="2703.68" dur="4.2">of this because it&apos;s more important than</text><text

believe</text><text start="2725.82" dur="4.32">in it right most people are willing to</text><text start="2728.73" dur="3.93">be disliked by the group that they</text><text start="2730.14" dur="3.78">identify as enemies though they might</text><text start="2732.66" dur="2.91">even take pride in it because they&apos;re</text><text start="2733.92" dur="5.79">doing in-group out-group

start="2741.15" dur="3.33">in group with is where it&apos;s actually</text><text start="2742.73" dur="2.68">consequential because losing the ones</text><text start="2744.48" dur="2.7">that I&apos;ve already lost isn&apos;t</text><text start="2745.41" dur="3.39">consequential so then I get to weaponize</text><text start="2747.18" dur="3.27">see I&apos;m willing to make a sacrifice and</text><text start="2748.8" dur="6.05">have enemies which is actually</text><text start="2750.45" dur="7.65">weaponizing the idea of sacrifice itself</text><text start="2754.85" dur="4.18">we can also see that so yeah the</text><text start="2758.1" dur="3.96">difference between virtue and virtue</text><text start="2759.03" dur="4.77">signaling is real virtue is not trying</text><text start="2762.06"

something</text><text start="2767.85" dur="6.03">where it is personally disadvantageous</text><text start="2770.85" dur="3.63">and so you can see someone&apos;s virtue in</text><text start="2773.88" dur="2.28">the</text><text start="2774.48" dur="4.86">series of choices they have made that</text><text start="2776.16" dur="4.65">have been hard choices so when someone</text><text start="2779.34"

start="2811.02" dur="9.93">right so I was having a conversation the</text><text start="2818.97" dur="8.07">other day with somebody about this and I</text><text start="2820.95" dur="10.65">was thinking about the kind of virtues</text><text start="2827.04" dur="7.319">the kind of self sacrifice and courage</text><text start="2831.6" dur="4.88">and valor and heroism that would have</text><text start="2834.359" dur="10.321">someone jump on a grenade to protect</text><text start="2836.48" dur="10.99">their fellows and how profoundly</text><text start="2844.68" dur="5.79">beautiful and incredible that impulses</text><text start="2847.47" dur="7.07">and that actual developed capacity and</text><text start="2850.47" dur="7.32">commitment in oneself and then the way</text><text start="2854.54" dur="6.25">that other people weaponize the most</text><text start="2857.79" dur="5.43">beautiful traits in someone right so</text><text start="2860.79" dur="4.68">like develop soldiers that have that</text><text start="2863.22" dur="3.96">virtue and then apply them to a</text><text start="2865.47" dur="3.03">false-flag war where they&apos;re told the</text><text start="2867.18" dur="4.11">war is for one reason and that&apos;s not</text><text start="2868.5" dur="4.71">really the reason that it&apos;s for so those</text><text start="2871.29" dur="7.17">who are running the false flag war are</text><text start="2873.21" dur="8.7">weaponizing the energy of patriotism of</text><text start="2878.46" dur="6.899">self-sacrifice of whatever in people and</text><text start="2881.91" dur="7.89">we can see that like as you know suicide</text><text start="2885.359" dur="6.331">bombing where a young person is willing</text><text start="2889.8" dur="3.54">to give up their life in service of the</text><text start="2891.69" dur="4.35">thing that they believe is right only</text><text start="2893.34" dur="5.25">when the infidels are gone well you know</text><text start="2896.04" dur="4.71">the world be remade and and I&apos;ll come</text><text start="2898.59" dur="4.17">back and etc and like that the other</text><text start="2900.75" dur="3.72">people are

start="2907.09" dur="11.1">and yet it&apos;s clearly some people who are</text><text start="2913.99" dur="7.47">fighting political and cultural wars who</text><text start="2918.19" dur="5.79">don&apos;t really believe in 72 virgins in</text><text start="2921.46" dur="4.38">heaven but believe in other much more</text><text start="2923.98" dur="4.68">strategic things who then end up</text><text start="2925.84" dur="4.44">weaponizing those people&apos;s deepest</text><text start="2928.66" dur="3.3">virtues that are more important in their</text><text start="2930.28" dur="5.09">own life weaponizing the sense of the</text><text start="2931.96" dur="7.89">sacred against them and against others</text><text start="2935.37" dur="8.11">this most thing to be able to</text><text start="2939.85" dur="6.78">actually turn what is most sacred into</text><text start="2943.48" dur="8.91">what is most defiled and that also is</text><text start="2946.63" dur="7.77">Ubiquiti like it blows my mind when i</text><text start="2952.39" dur="5.79">think about we talked about this before</text><text start="2954.4" dur="5.91">but when we think about things like</text><text start="2958.18" dur="5.52">christian holy war when think about the</text><text start="2960.31" dur="7.68">inquisition and it&apos;s like okay so people</text><text start="2963.7" dur="6.78">who are claiming to believe in Jesus as</text><text start="2967.99" dur="5.79">the Savior who said let he who has no</text><text start="2970.48" dur="5.61">sins cast the first stone and if they</text><text start="2973.78" dur="4.29">strike one cheek give them the other in</text><text start="2976.09" dur="3.9">seventy times seven and you know on and</text><text start="2978.07" dur="3.21">on all these types of things and Father</text><text start="2979.99" dur="5.25">forgive them for they know not what they</text><text start="2981.28" dur="5.73">do how we figure out in the name of the</text><text start="2985.24" dur="3.75">religion that believes in him to torture</text><text start="2987.01" dur="3.66">people who think differently or to burn</text><text start="2988.99" dur="5.04">them at the stake it&apos;s like what the</text><text start="2990.67" dur="6.03"> how do we figure out how to do that</text><text start="2994.03" dur="6.15">well there&apos;s a there&apos;s easy ways he also</text><text start="2996.7" dur="4.95">said you know I come not to destroy the</text><text start="3000.18" dur="3.03">law but to uphold it and then I can go</text><text start="3001.65" dur="2.7">back to Leviticus and then I can see</text><text start="3003.21" dur="6.69">where we were supposed to kill people</text><text start="3004.35" dur="10.29">and whatever right so basically so there</text><text start="3009.9" dur="6.24">are individuals who take tools and</text><text start="3014.64" dur="4.88">weaponize them in relationship with</text><text start="3016.14" dur="5.76">other individuals there are also</text><text start="3019.52" dur="5.41">individuals and groups and positions of</text><text start="3021.9" dur="5.87">power that seek to weaponize groups

a false enemy that will scare</text><text start="3032.7" dur="3.93">everyone and unify them together against</text><text start="3034.56" dur="4.4">that enemy that was either created or</text><text start="3036.63" dur="3.75">exaggerated to begin with or whatever</text><text start="3038.96" dur="3.339">and</text><text start="3040.38" dur="4.129">they are basically weaponizing people</text><text start="3042.299" dur="4.5">and people&apos;s courage to be willing to</text><text start="3044.509" dur="7.421">step up and fight so it&apos;s actually</text><text start="3046.799"

about giving</text><text start="3062.759" dur="7.26">examples of all the things that can be</text><text start="3064.559" dur="7.49">Mis applied and you know weaponizing is</text><text start="3070.019" dur="7.201">a strong term for all of the cases but</text><text start="3072.049" dur="6.55">but yes applied with some intention that</text><text start="3077.22" dur="4.68">has some knowing or not knowing</text><text start="3078.599" dur="5.52">distortion and some harm that will there</text><text start="3081.9" dur="4.859">is no doubt or not that will occur from</text><text start="3084.119" dur="6.571">it we can talk about the weaponization</text><text start="3086.759" dur="5.491">of science the philosophy of science and</text><text start="3090.69" dur="3.03">even more the practice of science and</text><text start="3092.25" dur="5.059">the funding of science we can talk about</text><text start="3093.72" dur="3.589">the weaponization of philanthropy of</text><text start="3098.269" dur="4.661">we&apos;ve talked about the weaponization of</text><text start="3100.859" dur="3.42">market dynamics quite a lot we could</text><text start="3102.93" dur="3.72">also talk about the weaponization of the</text><text start="3104.279" dur="3.81">critique of market dynamics to to then</text><text start="3106.65" dur="4.53">promote other things that are even</text><text start="3108.089" dur="5.94">nummer we can talk about where</text><text start="3111.18" dur="5.04">postmodern ideas became weaponized and</text><text start="3114.029" dur="5.82">then also over reactive critiques of</text><text start="3116.22" dur="5.069">post-modernism became weaponized we can</text><text start="3119.849" dur="3.541">look at where critical thinking was</text><text start="3121.289" dur="4.381">supposed to be a tool to help identify</text><text start="3123.39" dur="4.139">these things and it itself can be</text><text start="3125.67" dur="4.71">weaponized in many cases to lead to</text><text start="3127.529" dur="4.401">people who are overconfident and just</text><text start="3130.38" dur="4.889">simply looking for tools of rhetoric</text><text start="3131.93" dur="5.409">that have very little actual curiosity</text><text start="3135.269" dur="3.99">and are trying to support certainty</text><text start="3137.339" dur="3.601">rather than the kind of comfort with</text><text start="3139.259" dur="2.881">uncertainty that is of the basis of</text><text start="3140.94" dur="6.75">earnestness in the philosophy of science</text><text start="3142.14" dur="8.33">itself so you this would be a impossibly</text><text start="3147.69" dur="6.679">long video if we got into all of that</text><text start="3150.47" dur="7.24">but we could write we could look at</text><text start="3154.369" dur="5.46">examples of the applications of Buddhism</text><text start="3157.71" dur="6.03">that I think are pretty badly weaponized</text><text start="3159.829" dur="10.18">and of you know pick the religion picked</text><text start="3163.74" dur="8.309">or whatever and and yet also examples of</text><text start="3170.009" dur="3.751">things that are authentically good</text><text start="3172.049" dur="6.001">meaningful and maybe even necessary</text><text start="3173.76" dur="5.85">in all those places so hopefully we&apos;ve</text><text start="3178.05" dur="4.44">covered enough that there&apos;s enough</text><text start="3179.61" dur="4.74">examples that people can start to think</text><text start="3182.49" dur="3.72">through them and I think one of the most</text><text start="3184.35" dur="4.02">interesting things would be if people</text><text start="3186.21" dur="3.93">did and started to give examples of</text><text start="3188.37" dur="4.68">where they have seen this occur in</text><text start="3190.14" dur="4.44">various domains and especially if they</text><text start="3193.05" dur="2.82">didn&apos;t just give the examples of where</text><text start="3194.58" dur="5.1">they&apos;ve seen the people that they feel</text><text start="3195.87" dur="5.67">are other do it but that where they&apos;ve</text><text start="3199.68" dur="3.39">seen groups that they identify with do</text><text start="3201.54" dur="3.81">it and maybe where they can see both</text><text start="3203.07" dur="4.32">sides of a debate both in doing some</text><text start="3205.35" dur="5.25">kind of weaponizing and what engaging</text><text start="3207.39" dur="5.04">without that might look like if if there</text><text start="3210.6" dur="3.36">could start to be in the Facebook groups</text><text start="3212.43" dur="3.6">and then the YouTube thread like people</text><text start="3213.96" dur="10.08">actually discussing that that would be</text><text start="3216.03" dur="9.42">generative and of course YouTube is</text><text start="3224.04" dur="3.45">degenerate enough there would be trolls</text><text start="3225.45" dur="4.53">what I&apos;m hoping is that most people</text><text start="3227.49" dur="4.92">recognize that they themselves are</text><text start="3229.98" dur="5.88">sometimes susceptible to a subclinical</text><text start="3232.41" dur="5.04">degree of troll them where they&apos;re not</text><text start="3235.86" dur="4.07">full-blown trolls but they&apos;re also not</text><text start="3237.45" dur="9.27">engaging in the most generative way and</text><text start="3239.93" dur="9.52">hopefully seek to do better yeah the</text><text start="3246.72" dur="5.24">troll spectrum we&apos;re hoping to move</text><text start="3249.45" dur="2.51">people down</text><text start="3255.099" dur="6.18">to share here I don&apos;t believe that I am</text><text start="3259.66" dur="3.899">an expert in any of the topics I&apos;m</text><text start="3261.279" dur="5.131">talking about right now I&apos;m talking</text><text start="3263.559" dur="4.23">about them because there are certain</text><text start="3266.41" dur="3.569">phenomena that are quite clear to me</text><text start="3267.789" dur="4.17">that I see happening in this space that</text><text start="3269.979" dur="3.961">I want to address and I don&apos;t see it</text><text start="3271.959" dur="4.53">being addressed yet and I actually feel</text><text start="3273.94" dur="4.47">a certain responsibility to make sure</text><text start="3276.489" dur="4.08">that insofar as we have shared insights</text><text start="3278.41" dur="3.359">that we also share how to be thoughtful</text><text start="3280.569" dur="3.361">about the interpretation and use of</text><text start="3281.769" dur="7.23">those insights but I&apos;m sure that there</text><text start="3283.93" dur="7.23">are people who have studied the history</text><text start="3288.999" dur="4.381">and evolution and tools and technologies</text><text start="3291.16" dur="3.869">of propaganda and narrative warfare and</text><text start="3293.38" dur="3.3">information warfare much much better</text><text start="3295.029" dur="5.49">than I have I would be super interested</text><text start="3296.68" dur="6.24">in having those people on and same with</text><text start="3300.519" dur="3.75">like psychiatric diagnosis and various</text><text start="3302.92" dur="2.849">lines of it I&apos;m sure there are more</text><text start="3304.269" dur="3.0">nuanced thinkers so I&apos;m going to share</text><text start="3305.769" dur="3.45">the way that I think about it and I</text><text start="3307.269" dur="4.25">would be surprised if in five years I&apos;ll</text><text start="3309.219" dur="5.221">still think the same way about it and</text><text start="3311.519" dur="5.44">that&apos;s important because I like this is</text><text start="3314.44" dur="6.599">my best current thinking in an area that</text><text start="3316.959" dur="6.09">I know a little bit about so I would ask</text><text start="3321.039" dur="3.72">that people take it as a stimulus for</text><text start="3323.049" dur="6.54">your own thinking including where you</text><text start="3324.759" dur="7.11">disagree rather than as a am i right or</text><text start="3329.589" dur="3.72">not right and if I not right throw it</text><text start="3331.869" dur="3.75">out and don&apos;t even have stimulated</text><text start="3333.309" dur="4.5">thinking and if right then also don&apos;t</text><text start="3335.619" dur="3.96">have stimulated thinking the ability to</text><text start="3337.809" dur="3.871">treat someone as an authority and then</text><text start="3339.579" dur="4.051">either accept what they say and don&apos;t</text><text start="3341.68" dur="3.149">think or reject what they say and don&apos;t</text><text start="3343.63" dur="4.199">think like both of those are so</text><text start="3344.829" dur="5.88">uninteresting so my hope is that this</text><text start="3347.829" dur="4.801">video if it does anything stimulate your</text><text start="3350.709" dur="3.39">own deeper thinking and own exploration</text><text start="3352.63" dur="11.76">and study and learning and conversation</text><text start="3354.099" dur="12.031">on these topics okay so and and if you</text><text start="3364.39" dur="5.669">disagree with me about something I&apos;m</text><text start="3366.13" dur="6.75">super interested to know because like I</text><text start="3370.059" dur="5.851">said I&apos;m sure that conversations where</text><text start="3372.88" dur="4.949">people disagree is and I and in some</text><text start="3375.91" dur="3.089">places their right is why in five years</text><text start="3377.829" dur="2.67">I will think differently on these things</text><text start="3378.999" dur="2.52">than I do now just like I think</text><text start="3380.499" dur="2.431">different there are lots of things now</text><text start="3381.519" dur="2.73">they did five years ago so one of the</text><text start="3382.93" dur="4.589">places where my thoughts have updated</text><text start="3384.249" dur="5.241">was when I studied the literature on</text><text start="3387.519" dur="6.001">cluster be dynamic</text><text start="3389.49" dur="6.31">it really both helped and bothered me</text><text start="3393.52" dur="5.309">Plus to be 9mx mean meaning the sort of</text><text start="3395.8" dur="3.9">dot often called the dark triad yeah</text><text start="3398.829" dur="4.02">yeah</text><text start="3399.7" dur="4.83">and so I&apos;ll specifically say the thing</text><text start="3402.849" dur="3.691">we call antisocial personality disorder</text><text start="3404.53" dur="4.71">the sociopathy psychopathy and</text><text start="3406.54" dur="15.77">narcissism I&apos;ll particularly focus on</text><text start="3409.24" dur="17.43">those ones I had always previously taken</text><text start="3422.31" dur="8.35">people who behaved in those ways through</text><text start="3426.67" dur="8.61">a before I had studied that literature I</text><text start="3430.66" dur="6.3">took those behaviors as like from an</text><text start="3435.28" dur="3.51">attachment theoretic perspective that</text><text start="3436.96" dur="2.609">they had you know some kind of avoidant</text><text start="3438.79" dur="2.25">attachment where they had been</text><text start="3439.569" dur="5.331">traumatized so they couldn&apos;t trust well</text><text start="3441.04" dur="5.94">or you know something like that or they</text><text start="3444.9" dur="3.61">they were traumatized in the traumas</text><text start="3446.98" dur="3.72">perpetuating itself in some way but I</text><text start="3448.51" dur="5.45">took it that way where then my goal was</text><text start="3450.7" dur="5.129">to help heal the trauma and be</text><text start="3453.96" dur="4.57">redemptive right to be compassionate</text><text start="3455.829" dur="5.911">redemptive and I have a and I think lots</text><text start="3458.53" dur="4.62">of people have a very deep don&apos;t want to</text><text start="3461.74" dur="5.52">just villainize throw people away</text><text start="3463.15" dur="5.58">punished but recognize that insofar as</text><text start="3467.26" dur="3.059">people are hurting people it&apos;s often</text><text start="3468.73" dur="3.51">because they were hurt and the answer is</text><text start="3470.319" dur="3.871">not just a punitive answer right and we</text><text start="3472.24" dur="4.079">know that the just punitive answer</text><text start="3474.19" dur="3.419">itself leads to escalating warfare that</text><text start="3476.319" dur="3.721">leads to a world that&apos;s because</text><text start="3477.609" dur="4.681">we can&apos;t keep handling group punitive</text><text start="3480.04" dur="4.41">dynamics which is war with escalating</text><text start="3482.29" dur="4.2">texts so but I was very oriented in that</text><text start="3484.45" dur="4.95">way and I noticed that there were lots</text><text start="3486.49" dur="4.56">of people who had addictions and lied</text><text start="3489.4" dur="3.48">and did violent things that I spent time</text><text start="3491.05" dur="4.35">with and they really changed like the</text><text start="3492.88" dur="5.01">someone helping them have new</text><text start="3495.4" dur="5.4">experiences really change him awesome I</text><text start="3497.89" dur="6.54">also noticed some people didn&apos;t which I</text><text start="3500.8" dur="6.93">always took as a failing of my capacity</text><text start="3504.43" dur="4.71">to be more effective with them and as I</text><text start="3507.73" dur="4.609">started to say the literature I saw that</text><text start="3509.14" dur="5.49">where the failings had occurred and</text><text start="3512.339" dur="5.081">corresponding with the places where I</text><text start="3514.63" dur="5.13">had the most regrets in my life which</text><text start="3517.42" dur="4.199">usually involved giving the benefit of</text><text start="3519.76" dur="3.04">the doubt so I trusted someone

talked myself into it</text><text start="3525.74" dur="3.93">out of give the benefit of the doubt and</text><text start="3527.27" dur="5.61">be redemptive which means I gas lit</text><text start="3529.67" dur="5.73">myself right when we Gaslight other</text><text start="3532.88" dur="4.2">people what that means usually is that</text><text start="3535.4" dur="3.48">we share some kind of

dur="4.39">sometimes we will use our virtues to</text><text start="3544.34" dur="3.33">Gaslight ourselves and this is again</text><text start="3546.47" dur="3.15">where we have to be careful because is</text><text start="3547.67" dur="3.87">it that I have a real intuitive knowing</text><text start="3549.62" dur="3.99">and I&apos;m gaslighting myself in it with an</text><text start="3551.54"

Prejudice</text><text start="3558.47" dur="3.21">and using logic to help clear it as the</text><text start="3560.96" dur="3.96">right thing</text><text start="3561.68" dur="5.31">this is tricky and I can share</text><text start="3564.92" dur="4.53">no absolute rule other than no both of</text><text start="3566.99" dur="5.61">those things can be the case and really</text><text start="3569.45" dur="4.35">be thoughtful about it and create</text><text start="3572.6" dur="2.82">friendships with people that you also</text><text start="3573.8" dur="3.48">think are very thoughtful and kind of</text><text start="3575.42" dur="4.17">wise and explore the topics with them</text><text start="3577.28" dur="4.44">and like I don&apos;t have an algorithm and I</text><text start="3579.59" dur="3.78">don&apos;t believe there is one I believe one</text><text start="3581.72" dur="3.93">can simply understand the different</text><text start="3583.37" dur="2.76">types of failure case and be

damaging so I</text><text start="3600.16" dur="7.95">noticed that there were places where I I</text><text start="3602.72" dur="8.7">gasp let myself in overrode my own sense</text><text start="3608.11" dur="5.56">that someone was not trustworthy because</text><text start="3611.42" dur="3.81">I wanted to offer trust to them in a way</text><text start="3613.67" dur="3.21">that would help them be able to trust</text><text start="3615.23" dur="2.79">because obviously offering trust in good</text><text start="3616.88" dur="3.03">faith can help other people be able to</text><text start="3618.02" dur="4.05">trust but of course if I trust someone</text><text start="3619.91" dur="3.63">and as a result invite them into my life</text><text start="3622.07" dur="4.79">or circles or whatever in certain ways</text><text start="3623.54" dur="6.87">where then other people that trust me</text><text start="3626.86" dur="7.78">now can be hurt by those people then I</text><text start="3630.41" dur="6.6">actually became untrustworthy myself to</text><text start="3634.64" dur="4.71">the other people through my own poor</text><text start="3637.01" dur="3.84">discernment or poor boundaries and those</text><text start="3639.35" dur="3.18">were the places where I usually had the</text><text start="3640.85" dur="3.6">deepest regrets from like man I actually</text><text start="3642.53" dur="4.08">did something that led to other people</text><text start="3644.45" dur="3.81">getting hurt or me not upholding</text><text start="3646.61" dur="4.41">boundaries that I should have and it was</text><text start="3648.26" dur="5.31">it was actually out of my own desire to</text><text start="3651.02" dur="4.19">be redemptive and have good faith where</text><text start="3653.57" dur="4.269">it was inappropriate</text><text start="3655.21" dur="5.28">and so when I start understand the NPD</text><text start="3657.839" dur="5.651">sociopathy I started saying oh there are</text><text start="3660.49" dur="5.339">certain people where whom I&apos;m not going</text><text start="3663.49" dur="4.079">to say healing isn&apos;t possible a</text><text start="3665.829" dur="4.23">redemption isn&apos;t possible but it is of a</text><text start="3667.569" dur="4.981">different type what what it would take</text><text start="3670.059" dur="4.02">to heal it like that the pathology is of</text><text start="3672.55" dur="5.1">a different type it has created some</text><text start="3674.079" dur="6.061">very powerful self reinforcing loop that</text><text start="3677.65" dur="4.59">eats most types of therapy without</text><text start="3680.14" dur="3.479">actually addressing the loop and simply</text><text start="3682.24" dur="5.22">uses them to get better at doing the</text><text start="3683.619" dur="6.511">thing and so you either need to not</text><text start="3687.46" dur="4.05">engage or engage of some type that could</text><text start="3690.13" dur="3.179">be effective which I would say I don&apos;t</text><text start="3691.51" dur="7.62">see anyone who is generally good at that</text><text start="3693.309" dur="7.111">currently so then there are some times</text><text start="3699.13" dur="2.189">where rather than being redemptive the</text><text start="3700.42" dur="3.6">higher value is actually being</text><text start="3701.319" dur="6.691">protective which is again still not</text><text start="3704.02" dur="6.329">punitive right and it doesn&apos;t close the</text><text start="3708.01" dur="4.38">door on ever redemptive but it certainly</text><text start="3710.349" dur="3.661">says I&apos;m not going to try and do it and</text><text start="3712.39" dur="3.15">fail where I&apos;m actually not equipped to</text><text start="3714.01" dur="5.39">do it because of certain things that I</text><text start="3715.54" dur="6.509">notice so yes if there is someone who is</text><text start="3719.4" dur="4.78">oriented to power in a way that maybe</text><text start="3722.049" dur="3.75">has some defended blind spots where they</text><text start="3724.18" dur="3.06">don&apos;t even see that they are or they</text><text start="3725.799" dur="2.731">don&apos;t hold it that way or they don&apos;t</text><text start="3727.24" dur="3.66">hold that there&apos;s a problem with it or</text><text start="3728.53" dur="4.23">whatever and I show them hey the reason</text><text start="3730.9" dur="4.26">I don&apos;t trust you is these three things</text><text start="3732.76" dur="4.289">then what they know is oh I will make</text><text start="3735.16" dur="6.959">sure around him to never demonstrate</text><text start="3737.049" dur="7.741">those three things again and now they</text><text start="3742.119" dur="6.48">have gotten better right at being able</text><text start="3744.79" dur="6.299">to be covert in that process so we do</text><text start="3748.599" dur="4.02">have to be careful about hey when I</text><text start="3751.089" dur="3.901">offer feedback is this going to help</text><text start="3752.619" dur="4.651">someone actually heal because they have</text><text start="3754.99" dur="5.04">the earnest willingness and desire and</text><text start="3757.27" dur="6.93">capacity to heal or is this going to</text><text start="3760.03" dur="7.2">help weaponize their orientation now I</text><text start="3764.2" dur="4.32">have also seen obviously there are</text><text start="3767.23" dur="4.379">certain circles that don&apos;t talk about</text><text start="3768.52" dur="4.92">healing and in psychotherapy very much</text><text start="3771.609" dur="4.44">they might talk about religion or</text><text start="3773.44" dur="5.19">tradition or just science or whatever</text><text start="3776.049" dur="4.231">then they&apos;re in the circles that talk</text><text start="3778.63" dur="5.55">more about things like healing and</text><text start="3780.28" dur="6.0">healing trauma I don&apos;t know any places</text><text start="3784.18" dur="4.05">that attract narcissism sociopaths</text><text start="3786.28" dur="4.26">better because there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="3788.23" dur="3.54">vulnerable people</text><text start="3790.54" dur="4.89">that would be good sources of</text><text start="3791.77" dur="6.65">narcissistic supply and who are willing</text><text start="3795.43" dur="5.939">to hear like that&apos;s just your ego</text><text start="3798.42" dur="5.65">or me doing this as me just being</text><text start="3801.369" dur="4.591">authentic or being vulnerable or</text><text start="3804.07" dur="6.6">expressing my emotions or whatever else</text><text start="3805.96" dur="6.18">that basically allows bad behavior under</text><text start="3810.67" dur="3.75">the name of some therapeutic or</text><text start="3812.14" dur="5.61">spiritual idea and this is why we see so</text><text start="3814.42" dur="5.13">many spiritual teachers that we then see</text><text start="3817.75" dur="2.81">later we&apos;re being sexually or</text><text start="3819.55" dur="4.559">financially or emotionally</text><text start="3820.56" dur="5.83">psychologically abusive with people and</text><text start="3824.109" dur="5.701">in the therapeutic space because</text><text start="3826.39" dur="7.16">basically insofar as they&apos;re oriented to</text><text start="3829.81" dur="6.33">weaponize relationship and mind control</text><text start="3833.55" dur="4.059">the domains of mind control in the</text><text start="3836.14" dur="3.09">domains where there is legitimate</text><text start="3837.609" dur="3.151">Authority like a priest or a therapist</text><text start="3839.23" dur="3.72">or whatever where people are offering</text><text start="3840.76" dur="4.26">some degree of trust and vulnerability</text><text start="3842.95" dur="4.56">to legitimate Authority there are no</text><text start="3845.02" dur="4.29">more powerful positions to be able to do</text><text start="3847.51" dur="3.57">that thing now of course also economics</text><text start="3849.31" dur="3.059">politics military you know those other</text><text start="3851.08" dur="6.62">things but these are particularly</text><text start="3852.369" dur="5.331">sensitive in susceptible areas and so I</text><text start="3857.97" dur="6.51">have seen I&apos;ll give some examples of</text><text start="3862.09" dur="4.86">weaponization of psychological tools</text><text start="3864.48" dur="5.11">especially that show up in what we might</text><text start="3866.95" dur="6.54">call progressive new-age whatever kinds</text><text start="3869.59" dur="5.16">of circles that there are versions of</text><text start="3873.49" dur="2.879">this that are slightly different that</text><text start="3874.75" dur="3.51">showed up in the Catholic Dark Age or</text><text start="3876.369" dur="3.631">the whatever right like what what is the</text><text start="3878.26" dur="3.3">way that the the virtues the</text><text start="3880.0" dur="3.57">psychological tools spiritual insights</text><text start="3881.56" dur="3.75">get weaponized for power games but I&apos;ll</text><text start="3883.57" dur="4.02">share that these ones here because these</text><text start="3885.31" dur="3.63">you know because rebel wisdom hosts</text><text start="3887.59" dur="3.09">circling because people here are</text><text start="3888.94" dur="5.179">interested in psychological development</text><text start="3890.68" dur="3.439">so we need to be aware of these</text><text start="3895.9" dur="5.889">people can use the virtue or the</text><text start="3899.719" dur="6.451">statement of the virtue of transparency</text><text start="3901.789" dur="6.0">to just be and it&apos;s a weapon I</text><text start="3906.17" dur="3.24">it&apos;s a weaponization of the idea of</text><text start="3907.789" dur="5.31">transparency I remember the first time I</text><text start="3909.41" dur="5.669">saw this like which some it was like</text><text start="3913.099" dur="4.47">shocking and disgusting to me I saw this</text><text start="3915.079" dur="4.68">married couple that was there&apos;s many</text><text start="3917.569" dur="6.48">many years ago that was doing this like</text><text start="3919.759" dur="6.27">radical honesty group and he was saying</text><text start="3924.049" dur="4.26">things to her like your face looks</text><text start="3926.029" dur="5.671">really ugly today and she was saying</text><text start="3928.309" dur="4.17">things to him like I feel hatred arising</text><text start="3931.7" dur="5.609">and I want to throw you out the window</text><text start="3932.479" dur="6.39">and I was like and then they&apos;re saying</text><text start="3937.309" dur="4.821">we&apos;re just being radically honest and</text><text start="3938.869" dur="6.271">transparent and that&apos;s a virtue I&apos;m like</text><text start="3942.13" dur="5.26">no it&apos;s not like this is actually not a</text><text start="3945.14" dur="3.99">virtue this is you taking the lowest</text><text start="3947.39" dur="6.0">parts of your nature and amplifying the</text><text start="3949.13" dur="5.82"> out of them and in ways that don&apos;t</text><text start="3953.39" dur="4.949">actually serve anything other than</text><text start="3954.95" dur="5.73">cruelty and so it&apos;s very easy to see</text><text start="3958.339" dur="5.67">like that&apos;s not a healthy example of of</text><text start="3960.68" dur="5.7">transparency so then on the other side</text><text start="3964.009" dur="4.921">people can weaponize kindness or I&apos;ll</text><text start="3966.38" dur="4.859">say miss apply it but it can also be</text><text start="3968.93" dur="4.25">weaponized right which is no no we don&apos;t</text><text start="3971.239" dur="4.77">want to say things that are</text><text start="3973.18" dur="4.929">unnecessarily hurtful so then the</text><text start="3976.009" dur="4.11">overcompensation and that side can be</text><text start="3978.109" dur="2.97">well I&apos;m not gonna tell them those</text><text start="3980.119" dur="3.74">things because it would hurt their</text><text start="3981.079" dur="6.48">feelings which is actually now a</text><text start="3983.859" dur="7.811">rationalization for lying or lying</text><text start="3987.559" dur="5.79">through a mission which then like the</text><text start="3991.67" dur="2.939">other person doesn&apos;t have consent and is</text><text start="3993.349" dur="6.39">that information being withheld from</text><text start="3994.609" dur="6.63">them and so there is a dialectic</text><text start="3999.739" dur="3.81">relationship between something like</text><text start="4001.239" dur="4.02">honesty or transparency on one side and</text><text start="4003.549" dur="3.99">kindness and thoughtfulness on the other</text><text start="4005.259" dur="4.74">side that are both relevant and neither</text><text start="4007.539" dur="4.68">are the absolute virtue that trumps the</text><text start="4009.999" dur="4.86">set of things that all need considered</text><text start="4012.219" dur="5.01">to show up well right so this is</text><text start="4014.859" dur="4.98">important and I will specifically see</text><text start="4017.229" dur="3.84">that some people just being dumb and</text><text start="4019.839" dur="2.97">believing a teacher will do this</text><text start="4021.069" dur="3.48">nonsense right but nobody&apos;s particular</text><text start="4022.809" dur="4.05">narcissist but narcissists who want to</text><text start="4024.549" dur="3.181">kind of say mean things to people well</text><text start="4026.859" dur="2.25">then after</text><text start="4027.73" dur="3.21">words and people are all upset say</text><text start="4029.109" dur="3.271">you&apos;re shaming me for my honesty and</text><text start="4030.94" dur="3.63">transparency you&apos;re trying to get me to</text><text start="4032.38" dur="3.63">emotionally repress this you&apos;re the part</text><text start="4034.57" dur="3.15">of the patriarchy again that is trying</text><text start="4036.01" dur="3.0">to shut down emotions this is just about</text><text start="4037.72" dur="8.79">honestly embracing and accepting</text><text start="4039.01" dur="10.47">emotionality right hogwash I am</text><text start="4046.51" dur="5.28">responsible for my emotions and I don&apos;t</text><text start="4049.48" dur="3.45">want to suppress them where they&apos;ll blow</text><text start="4051.79" dur="3.54">up and I also don&apos;t want to</text><text start="4052.93" dur="4.439">unconsciously act on the lowest parts of</text><text start="4055.33" dur="4.26">n triggered and wounded parts of my</text><text start="4057.369" dur="4.021">nature I want to notice them and</text><text start="4059.59" dur="5.19">responsibly do what it takes to heal</text><text start="4061.39" dur="5.67">them without perpetuating harm and I</text><text start="4064.78" dur="3.93">don&apos;t want to perpetuate harm and then</text><text start="4067.06" dur="3.09">pretend that I didn&apos;t and say no no</text><text start="4068.71" dur="3.21">you&apos;re responsible for the meaning you</text><text start="4070.15" dur="5.55">made this is another classic example</text><text start="4071.92" dur="6.75">right which is a first person or a</text><text start="4075.7" dur="6.48">second person emphasis and in relational</text><text start="4078.67" dur="5.4">dynamics you can&apos;t hurt me because</text><text start="4082.18" dur="3.81">whatever you say is just you saying</text><text start="4084.07" dur="3.39">things it&apos;s the meaning that I make of</text><text start="4085.99" dur="4.02">it that hurts me well that&apos;s partially</text><text start="4087.46" dur="4.35">true and it&apos;s empowering to me to the</text><text start="4090.01" dur="3.09">degree that I hold it because even if</text><text start="4091.81" dur="3.87">you&apos;re an I don&apos;t have to get</text><text start="4093.1" dur="4.92">really bent out of shape about it but</text><text start="4095.68" dur="4.2">the moment I tried to tell someone else</text><text start="4098.02" dur="3.569">that the only reason they feel hurt by</text><text start="4099.88" dur="4.59">me is the meaning they&apos;re making up on</text><text start="4101.589" dur="5.491">it this is again like rule Omega can be</text><text start="4104.47" dur="4.32">offered not invoked I can take</text><text start="4107.08" dur="3.12">responsibility for not having my</text><text start="4108.79" dur="3.569">feelings hurt by what someone else says</text><text start="4110.2" dur="4.98">but I can&apos;t tell someone else they need</text><text start="4112.359" dur="5.761">to take responsibility for it therefore</text><text start="4115.18" dur="5.97">I can be an right now this is</text><text start="4118.12" dur="4.38">again tricky as because we can see</text><text start="4121.15" dur="2.91">where people will do that they will just</text><text start="4122.5" dur="2.609">be an and then say I&apos;m not being</text><text start="4124.06" dur="4.04">an I&apos;m just being me</text><text start="4125.109" dur="12.031">authentically and you&apos;re choosing to be</text><text start="4128.1" dur="14.949">unsolved in but then on the other side</text><text start="4137.14" dur="9.06">of that where is it important to</text><text start="4143.049" dur="5.131">actually help other people take more</text><text start="4146.2" dur="3.659">sovereign responsibility and say look</text><text start="4148.18" dur="3.179">I&apos;m actually not being an I&apos;m</text><text start="4149.859" dur="2.88">not being unlawful and considered I&apos;m</text><text start="4151.359" dur="5.761">saying something that is really true and</text><text start="4152.739" dur="6.48">important and consider it and the</text><text start="4157.12" dur="4.269">reactivity that you hold about it is</text><text start="4159.219" dur="6.73">actually taking you out of relationship</text><text start="4161.389" dur="7.68">right so again it&apos;s easy to air on</text><text start="4165.949" dur="5.931">either side of this so if someone gets</text><text start="4169.069" dur="6.96">their feelings hurt am I responsible</text><text start="4171.88" dur="6.129">kind of sometimes yes sometimes no to</text><text start="4176.029" dur="4.11">some degree as to some degree no right</text><text start="4178.009" dur="8.761">and how do we tell the difference that&apos;s</text><text start="4180.139" dur="8.551">the key question the moment I offer a</text><text start="4186.77" dur="7.44">algorithm for that that will become the</text><text start="4188.69" dur="8.04">new weapon and so what I can say is you</text><text start="4194.21" dur="4.8">can endeavor earnestly as best you can</text><text start="4196.73" dur="4.71">to notice where you&apos;re actually coming</text><text start="4199.01" dur="3.78">from and the effects of what you&apos;re</text><text start="4201.44" dur="2.429">doing and where others are actually</text><text start="4202.79" dur="3.48">coming from and the effects they&apos;re</text><text start="4203.869" dur="4.411">doing and also listen to other people&apos;s</text><text start="4206.27" dur="4.32">perspective on the way you&apos;re doing it</text><text start="4208.28" dur="4.95">and I don&apos;t have a better answer than</text><text start="4210.59" dur="4.77">that so there are certain things that</text><text start="4213.23" dur="3.389">seem obviously in bad faith there are a</text><text start="4215.36" dur="2.67">lot of other things that clearly the</text><text start="4216.619" dur="3.0">other person doesn&apos;t think it&apos;s in bad</text><text start="4218.03" dur="2.58">faith but they&apos;re making a mistake there</text><text start="4219.619" dur="2.191">are other things that might seem like</text><text start="4220.61" dur="2.67">they&apos;re in bad faith but it&apos;s just</text><text start="4221.81" dur="2.55">because the person saying something that</text><text start="4223.28" dur="2.31">pisses me off but they&apos;re actually</text><text start="4224.36" dur="9.24">showing up in good faith and I just</text><text start="4225.59" dur="9.96">don&apos;t want to hear it and so like here&apos;s</text><text start="4233.6" dur="6.9">a protocol that I hold in relationships</text><text start="4235.55" dur="7.98">for communication when I&apos;m communicating</text><text start="4240.5" dur="5.34">with someone I endeavor to and I</text><text start="4243.53" dur="3.93">definitely do not always succeed at this</text><text

start="4256.73" dur="3.06">I&apos;m gonna try to empathetically put</text><text start="4258.26" dur="3.689">myself in their shoes enough that I can</text><text start="4259.79" dur="3.57">customize how I communicate where</text><text start="4261.949" dur="2.75">they&apos;ll be able to hear it not just say</text><text start="4263.36" dur="3.75"> the way that makes sense to me</text><text start="4264.699" dur="3.581">you don&apos;t hear that here cuz I&apos;m talking</text><text start="4267.11" dur="2.339">to a huge number of people and I don&apos;t</text><text start="4268.28" dur="1.98">know how to do that for a huge number of</text><text start="4269.449" dur="2.881">people but when I&apos;m talking with</text><text start="4270.26" dur="4.229">somebody one on one that&apos;s my goal</text><text start="4272.33" dur="4.95">not as a manipulation but as a meeting</text><text start="4274.489" dur="4.351">someone where they are and saying my</text><text

actually communicate</text><text start="4282.56" dur="2.7">in a way where they hear what I&apos;m saying</text><text start="4284.179" dur="2.911">and I hear what they&apos;re saying</text><text start="4285.26" dur="5.85">communicate is to find some communion</text><text start="4287.09" dur="5.16">right and so if I&apos;m talking at them and</text><text start="4291.11" dur="2.52">they&apos;re not hearing what I&apos;m saying I</text><text start="4292.25" dur="2.909">want to take responsibility to say okay</text><text start="4293.63" dur="3.12">well even if their react</text><text

their ears that are</text><text start="4301.52" dur="3.719"> up the way they&apos;re hearing stuff</text><text start="4302.9" dur="4.739">I don&apos;t have to communicate with them</text><text

communion how do I check that my</text><text start="4312.409" dur="3.871">communication is landing and how do I</text><text start="4313.909" dur="3.841">use the frames the words the metaphors</text><text start="4316.28" dur="3.09">that might be able to make sense to them</text><text start="4317.75" dur="4.71">as opposed to just say it&apos;s your fault</text><text start="4319.37" dur="5.28">that you&apos;re listening badly on the other</text><text start="4322.46" dur="4.83">side when someone is talking to me as</text><text start="4324.65" dur="3.96">best I can I try to take responsibility</text><text start="4327.29" dur="2.9">to hear where they&apos;re coming from even</text><text start="4328.61" dur="4.14">if I think they&apos;re communicating poorly</text><text

blah blah blah blah blah and it&apos;s</text><text start="4336.05" dur="3.089">not true they never blow a lot but that</text><text start="4337.67" dur="4.049">like they&apos;re angry they&apos;re exaggerating</text><text start="4339.139" dur="5.341">but I&apos;m trying to listen to is there</text><text start="4341.719" dur="5.161">some true thing here rather than got</text><text start="4344.48" dur="4.949">caught up on what is false is there some</text><text start="4346.88" dur="6.839">actual need that isn&apos;t met that I can</text><text start="4349.429" dur="6.181">hear is there and because that&apos;s on</text><text start="4353.719" dur="4.741">either side of the communication that&apos;s</text><text start="4355.61" dur="4.56">me taking the responsibility to try to</text><text start="4358.46" dur="4.83">have effective communication come as</text><text start="4360.17" dur="5.37">much as I can now I also want to try and</text><text start="4363.29" dur="4.139">support them to do that but I can&apos;t</text><text start="4365.54" dur="2.97">force it I can only support it and then</text><text start="4367.429" dur="2.611">I have to pay attention to what is</text><text start="4368.51" dur="4.379">effective and actually supporting it and</text><text start="4370.04" dur="6.57">then I also ultimately decide whether or</text><text start="4372.889" dur="6.6">not I keep relating with them there</text><text start="4376.61" dur="5.43">there&apos;s so much nuance here and then</text><text start="4379.489" dur="6.17">again it&apos;s very easy for people to</text><text start="4382.04" dur="7.65">weaponize the idea of nuance generally</text><text start="4385.659" dur="6.161">the answer is that it&apos;s very easy to</text><text start="4389.69" dur="4.83">have a partial truth that polarizes that</text><text start="4391.82" dur="5.129">isn&apos;t held with other partial truths</text><text start="4394.52" dur="4.139">that polarize or like a fact right like</text><text start="4396.949" dur="3.151">the the facts we gave as examples</text><text start="4398.659" dur="4.171">earlier where I&apos;m cherry-picking out of</text><text start="4400.1" dur="5.67">datasets that is true but not</text><text start="4402.83" dur="5.22">representative and so then usually the</text><text start="4405.77" dur="4.889">answer is include more stuff which is</text><text start="4408.05" dur="5.37">more nuanced more complex but then I</text><text start="4410.659" dur="5.671">have seen people weaponize the idea of</text><text start="4413.42" dur="4.95">nuance when someone is actually stating</text><text start="4416.33" dur="3.78">something that is simple and actually</text><text start="4418.37" dur="2.94">has truth and clarity and simplicity and</text><text start="4420.11" dur="4.2">the other person doesn&apos;t want that</text><text start="4421.31" dur="6.87">boundary to exist then they say you&apos;re</text><text start="4424.31" dur="6.07">not being nuanced enough right and so</text><text start="4428.18" dur="5.31">this is why it&apos;s like the Dow that his</text><text start="4430.38" dur="6.18">name was not the eternal Dow the virtue</text><text start="4433.49" dur="6.73">that you say is the one that trumps all</text><text start="4436.56" dur="9.3">of the other ones the the protocol that</text><text start="4440.22" dur="7.86">is the protocol it doesn&apos;t exist and you</text><text start="4445.86" dur="2.94">know if I want to try and talk about</text><text start="4448.08" dur="4.65">integrity</text><text start="4448.8" dur="7.26">I usually don&apos;t think of integrity as a</text><text start="4452.73" dur="5.43">virtue or a value as much as I think</text><text start="4456.06" dur="4.44">that it about it as the degree of</text><text start="4458.16" dur="7.32">congruence between my behavior and all</text><text start="4460.5" dur="6.89">of my other virtues or values and so if</text><text start="4465.48" dur="7.59">I value kindness and I also value</text><text start="4467.39" dur="9.34">transparency and I value truth and I</text><text start="4473.07" dur="6.69">also value connection and I then how</text><text start="4476.73" dur="4.8">well am I able to navigate high</text><text start="4479.76" dur="2.97">correlation between the way I&apos;m showing</text><text start="4481.53" dur="4.37">up and all of those values</text><text start="4482.73" dur="7.52">simultaneously is kind of my integrity</text><text start="4485.9" dur="6.67">assessment we were talking about</text><text start="4490.25" dur="3.85">weaponizing certain psychological things</text><text start="4492.57" dur="3.99">and there&apos;s some more examples that are</text><text start="4494.1" dur="3.87">important so we talked about weaponizing</text><text start="4496.56" dur="5.19">transparency then we talked about</text><text start="4497.97" dur="5.76">weaponizing kindness I have seen so</text><text start="4501.75" dur="5.67">people can weaponize their own</text><text start="4503.73" dur="5.67">vulnerability where it&apos;s like I watched</text><text start="4507.42" dur="4.86">after brené Brown came out and did her</text><text start="4509.4" dur="5.37">stuff on vulnerability that then I saw</text><text start="4512.28" dur="4.89">all these things on Facebook of life</text><text start="4514.77" dur="3.45">coaches crying in the camera with tears</text><text start="4517.17" dur="4.2">in their eyes showing how vulnerable</text><text start="4518.22" dur="4.56">they are and you know then if you want</text><text start="4521.37" dur="4.26">to learn how to be vulnerable to their</text><text start="4522.78" dur="5.01">packages for sale and like oh</text><text start="4525.63" dur="5.49">like that that&apos;s like weaponizing via</text><text start="4527.79" dur="5.04">virtue signaling where the more</text><text start="4531.12" dur="3.54">vulnerable thing if they were being</text><text start="4532.83" dur="2.97">really vulnerable wouldn&apos;t be them</text><text start="4534.66" dur="2.61">crying about this thing that they&apos;ve</text><text start="4535.8" dur="3.63">already resolved and is really not</text><text start="4537.27" dur="4.05">actually consequential to them which is</text><text start="4539.43" dur="4.05">not real vulnerability it would be them</text><text start="4541.32" dur="4.29">saying I&apos;m broke right now guys and I</text><text start="4543.48" dur="5.01">need to pay the bills and I really want</text><text start="4545.61" dur="5.61">you to buy my package and I think that</text><text start="4548.49" dur="4.17">it&apos;s beneficial for some people and like</text><text start="4551.22" dur="2.58">that would be awesome actual</text><text start="4552.66" dur="6.15">authenticity and vulnerability which</text><text start="4553.8" dur="7.549">very rarely happens I have seen like one</text><text start="4558.81" dur="7.67">of the worst ones is weaponizing apology</text><text start="4561.349" dur="12.361">and and remorse so again associated with</text><text start="4566.48" dur="10.469">something like narcissism generally if</text><text start="4573.71" dur="5.04">the person feels that the person who&apos;s</text><text start="4576.949" dur="4.77">challenging them or upset with them</text><text start="4578.75" dur="5.909">doesn&apos;t have power and they do they will</text><text start="4581.719" dur="5.73">just say this is your ego making up</text><text start="4584.659" dur="4.891">nonsense and they&apos;ll Gaslight them but</text><text start="4587.449" dur="4.411">if the other person has power and they</text><text start="4589.55" dur="3.689">can&apos;t do that because it&apos;s a whole group</text><text start="4591.86" dur="3.359">of people calling them out or it&apos;s a</text><text start="4593.239" dur="4.351">very someone with a lot of following or</text><text start="4595.219" dur="3.991">whatever then the most effective</text><text start="4597.59" dur="5.069">game-theoretic thing for them to do</text><text start="4599.21" dur="5.13">might be to start crying and say oh my</text><text start="4602.659" dur="3.991">god I&apos;m so sorry this goes back to a</text><text start="4604.34" dur="4.379">childhood wound of mine and it&apos;s really</text><text start="4606.65" dur="3.42">vulnerable and I&apos;m working on it and I</text><text start="4608.719" dur="3.121">thought I had healed this pattern and</text><text start="4610.07" dur="4.44">still showing up thank you for showing</text><text start="4611.84" dur="5.42">it to me I&apos;m really gonna work on it I</text><text start="4614.51" dur="5.64">want you guys to hold me accountable and</text><text start="4617.26" dur="4.72">I have seen people do this with tears in</text><text start="4620.15" dur="3.9">their eyes and a week later do the exact</text><text start="4621.98" dur="4.009">same thing when powerful people weren&apos;t</text><text start="4624.05" dur="5.91">around to hold them accountable and that</text><text start="4625.989" dur="6.46">is basically weaponizing fake remorse</text><text start="4629.96" dur="4.32">and apology and whatever so you have to</text><text start="4632.449" dur="3.841">so if I notice that happen what I know</text><text start="4634.28" dur="4.04">is that no words that person says will</text><text start="4636.29" dur="4.77">mean anything to me</text><text start="4638.32" dur="3.94">so I would need to see if the that</text><text start="4641.06" dur="3.24">doesn&apos;t mean that I&apos;ve closed off</text><text start="4642.26" dur="4.919">redemptive possibilities it means I need</text><text start="4644.3" dur="4.049">a different kind of signal so if the</text><text start="4647.179" dur="3.9">person said no I&apos;ve really made a change</text><text start="4648.349" dur="4.381">I&apos;d be like awesome I&apos;m gonna watch that</text><text start="4651.079" dur="6.961">that bad behavior doesn&apos;t happen for</text><text start="4652.73" dur="6.929">three or five years and in including</text><text start="4658.04" dur="5.28">where you have to actually face</text><text start="4659.659" dur="5.911">consequential things right and so again</text><text start="4663.32" dur="3.87">the guy beats his wife when he&apos;s drunk</text><text start="4665.57" dur="2.73">and then the next day apologize I love</text><text start="4667.19" dur="2.759">you I&apos;m sorry I&apos;m never gonna drink</text><text start="4668.3" dur="3.689">again and whatever right and the pattern</text><text start="4669.949" dur="4.38">keeps rinse repeat it&apos;s not an apology</text><text start="4671.989" dur="4.081">at the level that will actually change</text><text start="4674.329" dur="5.16">the pattern therefore it is a weapon to</text><text start="4676.07" dur="4.47">keep her bound to an abuse cycle so when</text><text start="4679.489" dur="5.25">is an apology</text><text start="4680.54" dur="7.02">or remorse or accountability real well</text><text start="4684.739" dur="5.46">it it&apos;s when it is at the level of depth</text><text start="4687.56" dur="6.03">that will actually change the behavior</text><text start="4690.199" dur="4.901">if it isn&apos;t then whether the person</text><text start="4693.59" dur="7.99">thinks they mean it in the moment</text><text start="4695.1" dur="8.01">not you shouldn&apos;t trust it right so I I</text><text start="4701.58" dur="3.39">can obviously give a million examples</text><text start="4703.11" dur="3.87">what I&apos;m hoping is I&apos;ve given enough</text><text start="4704.97" dur="5.19">examples that you can start finding your</text><text start="4706.98" dur="4.71">own examples now does this mean that</text><text start="4710.16" dur="4.2">anytime someone is crying and</text><text start="4711.69" dur="4.05">apologizing that they are weaponizing it</text><text start="4714.36" dur="2.82">not earnest now sometimes they might</text><text start="4715.74" dur="3.66">really be earnest and they&apos;re going to</text><text start="4717.18" dur="3.51">shift forever or they&apos;re going to start</text><text start="4719.4"

seeking as</text><text start="4734.4" dur="3.6">soon as everyone&apos;s attention is off of</text><text start="4735.57" dur="4.23">them which is why three months isn&apos;t</text><text start="4738.0"

of</text><text start="5010.16" dur="3.0">the things that good sense-making</text><text start="5011.39" dur="5.49">requires it a lot more courage but also</text><text start="5013.16" dur="8.67">a lot

what</text><text start="5034.55" dur="3.96">the going on and playing video</text><text start="5035.81" dur="4.23">games or I got no idea what&apos;s true so</text><text start="5038.51" dur="3.09">I&apos;m gonna vote for a strong man leader</text><text start="5040.04" dur="4.68">that I think will at least protect me</text><text start="5041.6" dur="9.0">and more right so we can see the number</text><text start="5044.72" dur="8.1">of Russian citizens that say that they</text><text start="5050.6" dur="4.65">think Putin is lying even to them in the</text><text start="5052.82" dur="4.23">news but also still support him because</text><text start="5055.25" dur="3.99">they don&apos;t think that truth is a</text><text start="5057.05" dur="5.04">possibility and that a good strong</text><text start="5059.24" dur="4.65">politician facing huge opponents and</text><text start="5062.09" dur="4.68">enemies like the West has to lie and</text><text start="5063.89" dur="4.47">they at least think that he&apos;s gonna keep</text><text start="5066.77" dur="2.76">them safe and serve their interests</text><text start="5068.36" dur="3.38">better than some other people wouldn&apos;t</text><text start="5069.53" dur="5.4">and so you can see there</text><text start="5071.74" dur="5.02">when people&apos;s epistemic certainty is low</text><text start="5074.93"

in their interest and that</text><text start="5095.24" dur="4.89">will always lead in the direction of</text><text start="5097.12" dur="6.4">dictatorship towards despotism and if we</text><text

you don&apos;t commit to do what</text><text start="5121.7" dur="4.44">it takes to be actively informed and</text><text start="5124.01" dur="5.52">civically engaged then you consent to be</text><text start="5126.14" dur="6.15">ruled by those who seek to rule if you</text><text start="5129.53" dur="5.19">are willing to just adopt belief systems</text><text start="5132.29" dur="4.14">based on who the dominant group think</text><text start="5134.72" dur="4.95">closest to you that seems serve your</text><text start="5136.43" dur="5.37">interests as then you are consenting to</text><text start="5139.67" dur="4.56">be ruled and to the dissent towards that</text><text start="5141.8" dur="6.36">particular kind of dictatorship and if</text><text start="5144.23" dur="6.07">you want something like a democratized</text><text start="5148.16" dur="3.7">process democracy doesn&apos;t mean voting</text><text start="5150.3" dur="3.39">it&apos;s the it means a process by which</text><text start="5151.86" dur="3.42">more people are engaged in their own</text><text start="5153.69" dur="3.12">governance of which voting is one tool</text><text start="5155.28" dur="3.99">but the founding fathers said voting is</text><text start="5156.81" dur="4.71">the death of democracy I forget I think</text><text start="5159.27" dur="3.87">it was Jefferson said it because the</text><text start="5161.52" dur="3.57">democracy really meant can more of us</text><text start="5163.14" dur="4.82">engage in better conversations than the</text><text start="5165.09" dur="5.42">monarch says what happens right or the</text><text start="5167.96" dur="4.63">whatever kind of rulership there is and</text><text start="5170.51" dur="4.54">to the degree we have a town

dur="2.85">vote because we come up with something</text><text start="5177.93" dur="4.74">where we all agree that&apos;s a good idea</text><text start="5179.85" dur="5.51">and the vote is if we can&apos;t to sublimate</text><text start="5182.67" dur="5.4">physical warfare with a voting warfare</text><text start="5185.36" dur="4.24">right but it&apos;s actually a warfare where</text><text start="5188.07" dur="2.46">some people are now actually unhappy</text><text start="5189.6" dur="2.55">with the way the whole thing is moving</text><text start="5190.53" dur="3.48">forward but they at least think that</text><text start="5192.15" dur="4.02">still participating with that system is</text><text start="5194.01" dur="3.81">better than defecting on it and going</text><text start="5196.17" dur="3.47">into war so they&apos;re willing to do it and</text><text start="5197.82" dur="4.77">try again in the next four years right</text><text start="5199.64" dur="5.05">or whatever the next thing is but if we</text><text start="5202.59" dur="4.83">want something other than despotism it</text><text start="5204.69" dur="4.47">the only way to check power actually</text><text start="5207.42" dur="8.88">this is an important point that I would</text><text start="5209.16" dur="9.39">like to make them closing anyone who has</text><text start="5216.3" dur="5.7">asymmetric power whether that&apos;s more</text><text start="5218.55" dur="8.31">money or political power or cultural</text><text start="5222.0" dur="6.54">influence or whatever and usually those</text><text start="5226.86" dur="3.48">come together right more money also</text><text start="5228.54" dur="4.14">means that I can buy cultural influence</text><text start="5230.34" dur="4.14">through media and marketing and paying</text><text start="5232.68" dur="3.54">other people to say things that are</text><text start="5234.48" dur="3.6">aligned with what I want and being able</text><text start="5236.22" dur="5.04">to pay lobbyists and campaign budgets to</text><text start="5238.08" dur="5.97">get political power so we can just talk</text><text start="5241.26" dur="5.7">about power itself and all of those as</text><text start="5244.05" dur="5.7">expressions those who have more power</text><text start="5246.96" dur="5.34">within a power asymmetry both have the</text><text start="5249.75" dur="6.96">incentive and the capacity to maintain</text><text start="5252.3" dur="6.84">that power asymmetry and increase it so</text><text start="5256.71" dur="6.15">they have the ability to make news that</text><text start="5259.14" dur="5.73">does the bidding of what that has the</text><text start="5262.86" dur="5.85">populace believe things that continue to</text><text start="5264.87" dur="7.08">serve them having more power in that</text><text start="5268.71" dur="5.4">system they can get representation they</text><text start="5271.95" dur="4.56">can create technologies they can corner</text><text start="5274.11" dur="3.72">markets they can whatever it is corner</text><text start="5276.51" dur="2.91">scarce resources that allow them to</text><text start="5277.83"

will</text><text start="5287.13" dur="4.38">be kind of state you know leveled the</text><text start="5290.07" dur="3.509">playing field will be a bit leveled and</text><text start="5291.51"

dur="3.9">whatever dump all their stuff in the</text><text start="5451.85" dur="3.84">drinking water so we&apos;re gonna create</text><text start="5454.07" dur="5.19">regulatory bodies that keep them from</text><text start="5455.69" dur="5.04">the bind the market so then the markets</text><text start="5459.26" dur="3.78">primary goal is to capture those</text><text start="5460.73" dur="3.93">regulatory bodies right any anyone who&apos;s</text><text start="5463.04" dur="3.24">doing well in the market that is gonna</text><text start="5464.66" dur="3.63">do less well if the regulators are</text><text start="5466.28" dur="3.51">successful their primary agenda is to</text><text start="5468.29" dur="3.51">debase the integrity of the regulator</text><text start="5469.79" dur="4.08">and they can do that with legislation</text><text start="5471.8" dur="3.51">because the lobbyists are lawyers that</text><text start="5473.87" dur="2.55">have to be paid for by somebody and who</text><text start="5475.31" dur="4.44">has the money to pay them as the</text><text start="5476.42" dur="5.52">corporate interests the campaign budgets</text><text start="5479.75" dur="4.14">have

you&apos;ve</text><text start="5485.87" dur="4.35">only got four years in office blah blah</text><text start="5488.21" dur="3.33">blah right so it&apos;s very easy to see how</text><text start="5490.22" dur="3.18">the market is up capturing the</text><text start="5491.54" dur="4.68">regulatory forces to then end up doing</text><text start="5493.4" dur="4.68">their bidding so now we have banks that</text><text start="5496.22" dur="4.23">get bailed out when they actually should</text><text start="5498.08" dur="4.08">go bankrupt and oil companies that are</text><text start="5500.45" dur="3.96">subsidized like that&apos;s not a market what</text><text start="5502.16" dur="4.05">the and that&apos;s also not the healthy</text><text start="5504.41" dur="3.93">kind of binding the predatory aspects</text><text start="5506.21" dur="4.68">that&apos;s a crony capitalist type thing so</text><text start="5508.34" dur="5.31">if the regulator&apos;s are supposed to be</text><text start="5510.89" dur="4.77">able to bind the market type dynamics</text><text start="5513.65" dur="3.69">where the the predatory parts of the</text><text start="5515.66" dur="3.78">market they got asymmetric power over</text><text start="5517.34" dur="4.05">everybody else well who is it that&apos;s</text><text start="5519.44" dur="4.08">going to check the

dur="4.32">people are actually educated aware</text><text start="5527.33" dur="4.83">engaged enough to be able to do that is</text><text start="5529.61" dur="4.62">supposedly the idea which is why in the</text><text start="5532.16" dur="4.13">founding of you know the United States</text><text start="5534.23" dur="5.28">and we can look at examples and other</text><text start="5536.29"

civic</text><text start="5565.26" dur="3.57">engagement is where that would happens</text><text start="5566.64" dur="4.289">you see how much the study of the</text><text start="5568.83" dur="3.69">humanities and civics in the versions</text><text start="5570.929" dur="4.351">that would be relevant for this got cut</text><text start="5572.52" dur="4.5">after world war two stem and law

dur="2.759">that actually couldn&apos;t fight the</text><text start="5579.81" dur="3.27">dominant system effectively at all</text><text start="5581.159" dur="3.481">because it goes against itself
