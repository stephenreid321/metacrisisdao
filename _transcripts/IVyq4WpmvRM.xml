struggling to stay healthy on a vegan</text><text start="8.18" dur="0.49">diet?</text><text start="8.67" dur="3.94">There are people that have been easier
time being healthy</text><text start="12.61" dur="3.57">with animal products than without them.
There are a lot of people for whom it&apos;s the</text><text start="16.18" dur="0.58">opposite.</text><text start="16.76" dur="4.49">Where as soon as they become vegan they start feeling a lot healthier and issues clear</text><text start="21.25" dur="0.64">up and</text><text start="21.89" dur="3.13">they lose weight and their athletics become better.</text><text start="25.02" dur="3.0">Great, but for some people that have a
harder time with it</text><text start="28.02" dur="5.379">it&apos;s my belief that almost all of them can
learn how to be vegan just as</text><text start="33.399" dur="0.73">healthfully</text><text start="34.129" dur="4.021">but for some people,</text><text start="38.15" dur="3.1">getting a variety of amino acids</text><text start="41.25" dur="3.62">is a little bit more of a challenge because
they actually have to source them</text><text start="44.87" dur="3.72">intelligently, because when you&apos;re eating an animal, the animal eats whatever</text><text start="48.59" dur="3.16">a varied diet is and creates a complete
protein in its muscle</text><text start="51.75" dur="3.04">and when you eat that complete protein it breaks back down into all the</text><text start="54.79" dur="4.58">essential amino acids. But if we&apos;re just
eating, beans, legumes, the plant</text><text start="59.37" dur="0.61">sources</text><text start="59.98" dur="3.64">that are mostly not complete
proteins themselves, we have to make sure</text><text start="63.62" dur="2.17">we have some variety of those and if
someone</text><text start="65.79" dur="3.219">isn&apos;t paying attention to do that they
can start to get an amino acid imbalance.</text><text start="69.009" dur="4.581">So for the most part, I would say learn more. Having a complete amino acid profile is</text><text start="73.59" dur="1.31">one of the major things</text><text start="74.9" dur="3.53">that matters for people also
long-chain</text><text start="78.43" dur="3.18">fatty acids, specifically long-chain
omega-3 in your</text><text start="81.61" dur="3.63">flax oil and other seed oils you&apos;re
gonna be getting a form of  omega-3</text><text start="85.24" dur="2.76">called ALA which is a shorter chain. The
longer chain</text><text start="88.0" dur="4.33">EPA and DHA come in meats because the animal synthesizes it</text><text start="92.33" dur="1.37">and in egg yolk.</text><text start="93.7" dur="3.64">You can get those longer chains in
algae</text><text start="97.34" dur="4.67">and in algae oils, you can supplement with that but your body can also convert it</text><text start="102.01" dur="2.96">but it converts if your blood sugar is
balanced. If your blood sugar isn&apos;t</text><text start="104.97" dur="2.34">balanced and you have high resting insulin, it&apos;s harder to convert it.</text><text start="107.31" dur="4.29">For so many people that are eating a
higher starch, carbohydrate, sugar diet</text><text start="111.6" dur="3.21">then it&apos;s harder to convert those things.</text><text start="114.81" dur="3.559">And then for other people heme iron is
one of those</text><text start="118.369" dur="4.771">other challenges, again there are vegan and vegetarian source of iron that</text><text start="123.14" dur="1.22">do convert well</text><text start="124.36" dur="4.739">and the B vitamins that are essential
co-factors for the conversion of it</text><text start="129.099" dur="1.41">and so basically I would say</text><text start="130.509" dur="4.001">study and learn about it and almost
everyone that I have ever interface with</text><text start="134.51" dur="1.41">that was having a challenge with it,</text><text start="135.92" dur="3.37">actually to be honest everyone that I
have ever</text><text start="139.29" dur="4.55">worked with who wanted to be
vegetarian or wanted to be vegan for spiritual,</text><text start="143.84" dur="1.18">ethical, moral reasons</text><text start="145.02" dur="3.329">and was having a challenge with their
health and they felt better when they ate some meat</text><text start="148.349" dur="0.451">than not,</text><text start="148.8" dur="3.37">when we figured out what was going on,
what nutrients they were missing and</text><text start="152.17" dur="1.569">we figured out how to plant-source them,</text><text start="153.739" dur="4.991">they were all able to plant-source them
effectively. But to acknowledge</text><text start="158.73" dur="3.24">the possibility that someone doesn&apos;t yet
know how to do that</text><text start="161.97" dur="3.21">or maybe their body just can&apos;t, I just
want be open to that possibility,</text><text start="165.18" dur="3.66">then I&apos;m not going to begrudge that person for eating an animal product because if our</text><text start="168.84" dur="2.6">goal is to minimize suffering that means
to the person also.</text><text start="171.44" dur="3.74">And if they don&apos;t know how to not suffer
and I don&apos;t mean emotionally</text><text start="175.18" dur="2.24">because they&apos;re craving it because that&apos;s something that we can work with but I mean</text><text start="177.42" dur="1.01">physiologically,</text><text start="178.43" dur="3.16">then what I would say is, make sure that
you are</text><text start="181.59" dur="3.82">sourcing the things as ethically as
possible</text><text start="185.41" dur="3.079">and that you really doing the minimum</text><text start="188.489" dur="2.821">amounts of those possible to really
support you and so if you can get by</text><text start="191.31" dur="0.959">just with eggs</text><text start="192.269" dur="3.391">from a local farm and you don&apos;t need to
actually have a kill product</text><text start="195.66" dur="3.719">then the fact that you need some animal
product does not automatically justify</text><text start="199.379" dur="1.121">going to kill products.</text><text start="200.5" dur="3.58">And if you do need to kill product and
you find some sustainably</text><text start="204.08" dur="2.78">harvested thing that doesn&apos;t mean go to factory-farmed things.</text><text start="206.86" dur="4.769">I would just say if you&apos;re in that place
where you have an ethical care for</text><text start="211.629" dur="3.86">the sentient experience of other life forms</text><text start="215.489" dur="3.571">and yet you don&apos;t know how to do it with
your body yet,</text><text start="219.06" dur="4.069">have compassion with yourself so</text><text start="223.129" dur="3.461">that you don&apos;t have to shame yourself
for just not knowing how to do it yet</text><text start="226.59" dur="1.05">and</text><text start="227.64" dur="3.2">make sure</text><text start="230.84" dur="4.399">that you also hold the lines of, okay if I
need to do this that doesn&apos;t mean that I</text><text start="235.239" dur="1.89">automatically do a bunch of other things,
right?</text><text start="237.129" dur="2.97">Because very often there is a black and white kind of thinking where as soon as we have a</text><text start="240.099" dur="1.67">real justification for part,</text><text start="241.769" dur="3.561">we end up leaking beyond that. And then
the other thing is</text><text start="245.33" dur="4.14">do continue to work to progress in that
area and educate yourself and see if you</text><text start="249.47" dur="2.61">can get to where, hey I needed that but
now I don&apos;t anymore</text><text start="252.08" dur="3.37">and it&apos;s been my experience it with
right education and support from other</text><text start="255.45" dur="1.349">people that know more about it,</text><text start="256.799" dur="3.96">I have yet to find anyone that hasn&apos;t
been able to do it healthfully.</text><text start="260.759" dur="3.421">Yeah, I feel like it&apos;s a journey for
everyone. I know for myself</text><text start="264.18" dur="3.78">when I initially became a vegan, I ate a lot more processed food</text><text start="267.96" dur="4.979">and learning to eat more whole foods, whole grains and vegetables and fruits and</text><text start="272.939" dur="3.54">and things that don&apos;t have a lot of
other ingredients in them has really helped</text><text start="276.479" dur="1.74">me thrive on a vegan diet.</text><text start="278.219" dur="3.91">What someone replaces the meat
with is a big deal because</text><text start="282.129" dur="4.391">if they were eating meat that was a
a lot of say, pre-processed fast food</text><text start="286.52" dur="0.59">or whatever because</text><text start="287.11" dur="3.97">they&apos;re not really in the food prep way
of mind and so now</text><text start="291.08" dur="3.929">they&apos;re still doing kind of  pre-processed, etc., that means it&apos;s probably going to</text><text start="295.009" dur="3.201">be mostly all grain products that
they&apos;re replacing it with and now they&apos;re doing</text><text start="298.21" dur="2.609">a bunch of breads and cereals and pastas and</text><text start="300.819" dur="3.96">that does mean that they are likely to
get unstable blood sugar</text><text start="304.779" dur="4.67">that they are likely to get amino acid
imbalances</text><text start="309.449" dur="4.18">and it&apos;s just not a healthy diet so the
protein has to be replaced with other</text><text start="313.629" dur="1.15">things that contain</text><text start="314.779" dur="3.16">protein, which is complexes of</text><text start="317.939" dur="4.991">beans and legumes and nuts and seeds as well as potential algae, sea vegetables,</text><text start="322.93" dur="3.319">fresh green vegetables</text><text start="326.249" dur="3.361">and so moving to vegan healthfully</text><text start="329.61" dur="2.919">usually also means a movement towards
more whole foods.</text></transcript>
