start="185.16" dur="5.52">from say where we were in</text><text start="188.22" dur="4.68">January whatever it was was it 2020 that</text><text start="190.68" dur="3.779">we went into lockdown is that right so</text><text start="192.9" dur="5.4">we went in like February or March right</text><text start="194.459" dur="5.761">so what going into that wood chipper of</text><text start="198.3" dur="3.42">existence</text><text start="200.22" dur="3.9">um what&apos;s changed or shifted because</text><text start="201.72" dur="4.019">obviously there&apos;s been so much and I</text><text

dur="4.92">of you know this conversation and and</text><text start="225.659" dur="4.14">our friends our colleagues</text><text start="228.12" dur="5.0">um and just what what you&apos;re sensing and</text><text start="229.799" dur="3.321">the kind of zeitgeist of the space</text><text start="236.22" dur="4.98">it&apos;s an interesting question because the</text><text start="238.92" dur="7.08">the initial frame of</text><text start="241.2" dur="6.119">what things are in the conversation</text><text start="246.0" dur="3.0">it</text><text start="247.319" dur="3.84">it actually seems like a pretty small</text><text start="249.0" dur="7.44">number of people that think about</text><text start="251.159" dur="6.901">existential risk and all things positive</text><text start="256.44" dur="4.62">um and state of the world as a whole</text><text start="258.06" dur="3.919">like as a single conversation</text><text start="261.06" dur="3.18">um</text><text start="261.979" dur="6.78">I would say the biggest changes that</text><text start="264.24" dur="4.519">I&apos;ve seen in terms of people&apos;s sense of</text><text start="269.639" dur="5.101">like maybe what that conversation has in</text><text start="272.16" dur="5.16">common is people who are thinking about</text><text start="274.74" dur="4.2">uh Humanity in the world globally what</text><text start="277.32" dur="3.48">are the major issues that we Face rather</text><text start="278.94" dur="4.199">than in a specific sector or by a</text><text start="280.8" dur="4.5">specific Nation or to a specific you</text><text start="283.139" dur="4.801">know audience of people but what are the</text><text start="285.3" dur="4.26">things Humanity faces globally and what</text><text start="287.94" dur="4.62">are the ways of</text><text start="289.56" dur="5.22">addressing those that might be adequate</text><text start="292.56" dur="6.18">or meaningful and how do those global</text><text

before</text><text start="303.78" dur="3.18">covid</text><text start="305.04" dur="3.719">the</text><text start="306.96" dur="4.44">Trump election</text><text start="308.759" dur="5.281">I noticed a launch shift in my</text><text start="311.4" dur="5.04">conversation publicly but also in my</text><text start="314.04" dur="4.159">conversation with a lot of institutional</text><text start="316.44" dur="6.3">heads whether like academic government</text><text start="318.199" dur="6.641">big business whatever in their sense of</text><text start="322.74" dur="3.66">there are problems but there have always</text><text start="324.84" dur="3.84">been problems this is kind of business</text><text start="326.4" dur="3.78">as usual to the sense that oh no we&apos;re</text><text start="328.68" dur="5.04">actually entering a kind of different</text><text start="330.18" dur="6.54">phase where Pax Americana and the</text><text start="333.72" dur="6.24">post-world War II world seems to be</text><text start="336.72" dur="6.0">um shifting radically it seems like the</text><text start="339.96" dur="4.86">degree of bipartisan like Venom and</text><text start="342.72" dur="3.02">polarization associated with the Trump</text><text start="344.82" dur="3.78">election</text><text start="345.74" dur="5.019">had a lot of people who had before that</text><text start="348.6" dur="4.08">still been arguing their problems but</text><text start="350.759" dur="3.66">the country Works fundamentally fine it</text><text start="352.68" dur="3.42">works better than any other country to</text><text start="354.419" dur="3.72">like oh maybe there&apos;s actually an</text><text start="356.1" dur="5.7">existential risk to democracy itself</text><text start="358.139" dur="5.821">maybe you know maybe uh social media</text><text start="361.8" dur="4.14">technology really did break the fourth</text><text start="363.96" dur="3.9">estate in a way that breaks to democracy</text><text start="365.94" dur="4.259">but is fine for autocracy I I started</text><text start="367.86" dur="4.619">noticing much more serious consideration</text><text start="370.199" dur="4.321">regarding like the fundamental</text><text start="372.479" dur="3.66">viability of these social systems that</text><text start="374.52" dur="2.88">we&apos;ve depended upon liberal democracy</text><text start="376.139" dur="2.701">and things like that</text><text start="377.4" dur="4.019">and then</text><text start="378.84" dur="6.18">the</text><text start="381.419" dur="5.521">so much of Australia coming on fire</text><text start="385.02" dur="4.86">and then everybody&apos;s forgetting that</text><text start="386.94" dur="4.199">because of covid when that was like the</text><text start="389.88" dur="4.68">biggest thing ever</text><text start="391.139" dur="5.641">and then the secondary shocks of cobit</text><text start="394.56" dur="4.199">from the supply chain effects to the</text><text start="396.78" dur="5.1">economic effects to the</text><text start="398.759" dur="5.101">that and then I think definitely January</text><text start="401.88" dur="3.96">6th and</text><text start="403.86" dur="3.839">um all of the uh George Floyd related</text><text start="405.84" dur="4.919">protests and</text><text start="407.699" dur="4.861">um that Suite of things seems to have</text><text start="410.759" dur="4.681">made</text><text start="412.56" dur="4.82">the small group of people that saw that</text><text start="415.44" dur="4.979">these current world systems were</text><text start="417.38" dur="5.379">untenable and kind of unwinding made</text><text start="420.419" dur="3.661">that pretty popularly</text><text start="422.759" dur="3.541">um</text><text start="424.08" dur="3.72">if not believed at least something that</text><text start="426.3" dur="4.08">a lot of people were sensitive to and</text><text start="427.8" dur="4.56">particularly the people who have been in</text><text start="430.38" dur="5.159">the running the institution&apos;s position</text><text start="432.36" dur="5.04">that is what I find very interesting</text><text start="435.539" dur="3.061">so what I&apos;ve found is that I&apos;ve had way</text><text start="437.4" dur="2.94">more people</text><text start="438.6" dur="3.599">asking</text><text start="440.34" dur="4.02">about things like how do we</text><text start="442.199" dur="4.981">fundamentally redesign our political</text><text start="444.36" dur="5.16">economy how do we how do we</text><text start="447.18" dur="4.38">build a world where democracy is viable</text><text start="449.52" dur="3.84">in a post social media and pretty soon</text><text start="451.56" dur="5.539">post deep fake world</text><text start="453.36" dur="6.239">like and asking in</text><text start="457.099" dur="4.66">even getting a little bit more future</text><text start="459.599" dur="3.6">oriented what does the future of economy</text><text start="461.759" dur="3.121">and education and everything in a</text><text start="463.199" dur="6.181">post-technological automation world look</text><text start="464.88" dur="5.879">like it&apos;s those are questions now that</text><text start="469.38" dur="3.36">um there are very few people in</text><text start="470.759" dur="3.901">institutional positions not kind of</text><text start="472.74" dur="4.399">interested in and there were very few</text><text start="474.66" dur="5.34">very interested in them before</text><text start="477.139" dur="5.321">yeah that reminds me of uh that</text><text start="480.0" dur="4.139">University of Chicago philosopher</text><text start="482.46" dur="3.66">Jonathan Leah who wrote that book</text><text start="484.139" dur="3.361">radical hope and I I reference him at</text><text start="486.12" dur="3.5">the end of recapture the

own demise is one of the blind</text><text start="494.52" dur="4.079">spots of any culture and it does feel</text><text start="497.16" dur="3.3">it&apos;s with FM tracking what you&apos;re saying</text><text start="498.599" dur="4.141">you&apos;re sort of suggesting that 2016</text><text start="500.46" dur="5.22">through now including both the political</text><text start="502.74" dur="5.54">disruptions there brexit Trump you know</text><text start="505.68" dur="4.68">Gen 6 but also these psychosocial</text><text start="508.28" dur="3.34">governmental policy everything of</text><text start="510.36" dur="2.82">quarantine</text><text start="511.62" dur="2.88">um has just massively stretched the</text><text start="513.18" dur="4.62">Overton window</text><text start="514.5" dur="6.12">as to what quote unquote mainstream or</text><text start="517.8" dur="4.619">or polite opinion is willing to</text><text start="520.62" dur="4.26">entertain at this point</text><text start="522.419" dur="4.261">yeah totally and you know I know our</text><text start="524.88" dur="4.019">friend uh Nate Higgins is just out with</text><text start="526.68" dur="4.14">you and like they&apos;re</text><text start="528.899" dur="4.201">there are some things that are still</text><text start="530.82" dur="5.34">really far outside the Overton window of</text><text start="533.1" dur="3.84">thinking about adequate solutions to</text><text start="536.16" dur="2.76">um</text><text start="536.94" dur="4.74">and so when</text><text start="538.92" dur="4.859">when you it I&apos;ll just take his as an</text><text start="541.68" dur="3.18">example because maybe people here are</text><text start="543.779" dur="2.221">familiar</text><text start="544.86" dur="2.58">um</text><text start="546.0" dur="3.6">one of the things that he looks at very</text><text start="547.44" dur="4.019">deeply is that the GDP of the world the</text><text start="549.6" dur="3.419">total size of the global economy is</text><text start="551.459" dur="3.06">pegged very tightly to the total amount</text><text start="553.019" dur="3.301">of energy used which makes sense right</text><text start="554.519" dur="3.061">whether you&apos;re any good or service was</text><text start="556.32" dur="3.24">going to require some energy so it&apos;s</text><text start="557.58" dur="3.72">kind of tightly pegged we say well what</text><text start="559.56" dur="3.12">about efficiency shouldn&apos;t we get more</text><text start="561.3" dur="4.38">dollars per Joule of energy with</text><text start="562.68" dur="4.92">efficiency yeah but at a smaller rate of</text><text start="565.68" dur="3.9">changes in efficiency then the rate of</text><text start="567.6" dur="3.78">increased demand of energy from the</text><text start="569.58" dur="3.96">increased demand in finance and those</text><text start="571.38" dur="4.8">efficiencies lead to using more energy</text><text start="573.54" dur="4.26">is that javen&apos;s Paradox Devin&apos;s Paradox</text><text start="576.18" dur="3.839">anytime you get an increase in</text><text start="577.8" dur="4.2">efficiency of energy you use more energy</text><text start="580.019" dur="4.581">because when energy becomes a little bit</text><text start="582.0" dur="4.44">cheaper you get new markets that open up</text><text start="584.6" dur="2.5">and</text><text start="586.44" dur="2.28">um</text><text start="587.1" dur="3.84">and the energy return on energy</text><text start="588.72" dur="3.72">investment needed to get us off oil</text><text start="590.94" dur="2.88">means you&apos;ve got to use a lot of oil and</text><text start="592.44" dur="2.88">coal to make those solar panels it&apos;s</text><text start="593.82" dur="3.42">going to take them 10 years or however</text><text start="595.32" dur="3.36">long to make enough energy to pay off</text><text start="597.24" dur="3.8">the energy it took it just doesn&apos;t</text><text start="598.68" dur="4.98">converge and so then we say okay well</text><text start="601.04" dur="4.84">this is like a key Insight is that</text><text start="603.66" dur="4.08">somewhere around 2019 we started getting</text><text start="605.88" dur="3.84">very clear diminishing returns on</text><text start="607.74" dur="3.48">hydrocarbon investment meaning it takes</text><text start="609.72" dur="3.72">more barrels of oil to get a new barrel</text><text start="611.22" dur="3.179">of oil it&apos;s not specifically like toss</text><text start="613.44" dur="2.16">ends and fracking and all the</text><text start="614.399" dur="4.081">diminishing returns on those original</text><text start="615.6" dur="4.56">bonanzas exactly and so if we&apos;re in a</text><text start="618.48" dur="3.66">place where we can get more oil but</text><text start="620.16" dur="3.359">we&apos;re getting lower energy return on</text><text start="622.14" dur="4.5">energy investment which is going to</text><text start="623.519" dur="5.101">continue to happen while having a need</text><text start="626.64" dur="3.6">for an exponential amount more money for</text><text start="628.62" dur="3.0">the financial system to keep up with its</text><text start="630.24" dur="3.12">own interest and the money in the oil</text><text start="631.62" dur="2.64">are correlated that thing doesn&apos;t get to</text><text start="633.36" dur="3.06">keep going</text><text start="634.26" dur="4.68">and so then there&apos;s

there was a that&apos;s what</text><text start="1069.799" dur="3.12">I would call there was like a standard</text><text start="1071.12" dur="4.02">model narrative</text><text start="1072.919"

um</text><text start="1455.72" dur="3.72">and this is you know Pat Ryan&apos;s stuff he</text><text start="1457.88" dur="4.62">was talking about this years ago on auto</text><text start="1459.44" dur="5.34">Cults that you would he was predicting</text><text start="1462.5" dur="3.96">that we&apos;d have this phenomena that</text><text start="1464.78" dur="3.66">things like Colts would just

dur="6.761">because when and I would say the</text><text start="1474.32" dur="5.16">underlying cause of this or one thing we</text><text start="1477.32" dur="5.64">have to factor is that of all of the</text><text start="1479.48" dur="5.52">singularities that Kurzweil talked about</text><text start="1482.96" dur="4.86">um the info Singularity is the first one</text><text start="1485.0" dur="4.679">meaning the the</text><text start="1487.82" dur="4.5">Singularity meaning the point at which</text><text start="1489.679" dur="3.961">things change so radically that we can&apos;t</text><text start="1492.32" dur="2.76">really predict what&apos;s going to happen or</text><text start="1493.64" dur="2.88">how to respond to them afterwards and</text><text start="1495.08" dur="3.3">where humans kind of can&apos;t keep up with</text><text start="1496.52" dur="4.139">the pace of technological change</text><text start="1498.38" dur="3.9">the idea of the information Singularity</text><text start="1500.659" dur="3.061">is that so much information would be</text><text start="1502.28" dur="2.58">published that no human could process</text><text start="1503.72" dur="2.339">all the relevant information about</text><text start="1504.86" dur="3.059">anything</text><text start="1506.059" dur="3.36">and so there would no longer be an</text><text start="1507.919" dur="4.74">expert and that&apos;s already true right</text><text start="1509.419" dur="5.581">it&apos;s already true that you&apos;ll have more</text><text start="1512.659" dur="4.26">peer-reviewed

things like</text><text start="1541.52" dur="4.2">news feed algorithms Facebook and other</text><text start="1543.62" dur="3.84">news feed algorithms at least deciding</text><text start="1545.72" dur="3.18">of all the stuff out there what makes it</text><text start="1547.46" dur="3.42">into your feed because you&apos;re not going</text><text start="1548.9" dur="3.96">to see a million news articles in the</text><text start="1550.88" dur="3.659">day so the ones that make it in are</text><text start="1552.86" dur="4.74">based on personalized data harvesting</text><text start="1554.539" dur="4.321">about you mostly focused on not trying</text><text start="1557.6" dur="3.36">to make you believe something but what</text><text start="1558.86" dur="3.419">you actually interact with the

dur="4.74">marshmallow stuff right mostly based on</text><text start="1566.24" dur="4.679">like what actually makes you click with</text><text start="1568.76" dur="3.899">it because the title was so

dur="4.561">something like that</text><text start="1575.299" dur="4.561">and so that phenomena means everybody</text><text start="1578.48" dur="2.64">doesn&apos;t see the same thing

right I think</text><text start="1591.559" dur="3.541">twitching is a term you use it and that</text><text start="1593.779" dur="2.821">usually means in the direction of their</text><text

can&apos;t put lead out because the</text><text start="2090.82" dur="3.42">market just figured out how to add it</text><text start="2092.2" dur="3.3">and then only after enough people die</text><text

of</text><text start="2140.079" dur="6.481">the amount of power of exponential Tech</text><text start="2143.859" dur="4.861">you can&apos;t let it out unregulated first</text><text start="2146.56"

you</text><text start="2153.579" dur="3.301">can&apos;t regulate it at a national level so</text><text start="2155.5" dur="5.099">you do have to have something like</text><text start="2156.88"

dur="5.701">democracy that was occurring and say</text><text start="3216.24" dur="5.579">that was the philosophy upon which</text><text start="3219.3" dur="5.519">the political thinkers were saying

things like public education so</text><text start="3239.46" dur="2.58">that that was being insured for everyone</text><text start="3240.599" dur="3.121">which wasn&apos;t a thing under most of</text><text start="3242.04" dur="4.559">feudalism right</text><text start="3243.72" dur="4.619">um and tripartite government term limits</text><text start="3246.599" dur="3.361">there was all sorts of these fairly</text><text start="3248.339" dur="4.381">ingeniously constructed checks and</text><text start="3249.96" dur="5.099">balances effectively to nudge towards</text><text start="3252.72"

dur="3.24">purpose you know secondary question but</text><text start="3265.14" dur="3.719">I mean it does feel like the</text><text start="3266.52" dur="4.86">architecture was surprisingly

start="3273.059" dur="4.081">for purpose so a different instantiation</text><text start="3275.22" dur="3.18">a different way that they play out so</text><text start="3277.14" dur="4.199">like I don&apos;t know if you&apos;ve had</text><text start="3278.4" dur="4.62">Alexander Bardon he has a</text><text start="3281.339" dur="4.141">he&apos;s a he&apos;s an interesting thinker in</text><text

every system of</text><text start="3289.319" dur="4.681">governance that was stable long term had</text><text start="3291.9" dur="5.459">three things that were somewhat similar</text><text start="3294.0" dur="6.0">um like structurally similar to</text><text start="3297.359" dur="4.74">um a Judicial uh executive and uh</text><text start="3300.0" dur="3.059">legislative branch</text><text start="3302.099" dur="3.301">um</text><text start="3303.059" dur="4.321">I think</text><text start="3305.4" dur="4.26">so I think things like</text><text start="3307.38" dur="5.1">separations of Power are trying to get</text><text start="3309.66" dur="4.8">to something deeper which is avoiding</text><text start="3312.48" dur="4.52">centralized failure modes either from</text><text start="3314.46" dur="5.46">corruption or bias and blindness right</text><text start="3317.0" dur="4.42">and that doesn&apos;t mean we have to do it</text><text start="3319.92" dur="4.139">through separations of power like we</text><text start="3321.42" dur="4.02">could do it through something like</text><text start="3324.059" dur="4.5">uh</text><text start="3325.44" dur="4.619">computational methods allowed the</text><text start="3328.559" dur="3.54">transparency on the information</text><text start="3330.059" dur="3.601">provenance of the whole system and</text><text start="3332.099" dur="3.181">insurance that all of the information</text><text start="3333.66" dur="4.199">was being processed with all the</text><text start="3335.28" dur="4.62">relevant epistemologies but that wasn&apos;t</text><text start="3337.859" dur="3.841">possible then so simply checks and</text><text start="3339.9" dur="3.36">balances on power was how you prevented</text><text start="3341.7" dur="2.94">centralized capture corruption or</text><text start="3343.26" dur="3.78">failure</text><text start="3344.64" dur="3.979">say that last sentence again</text><text start="3347.04" dur="4.5">um</text><text start="3348.619" dur="4.901">separating power into these various</text><text start="3351.54" dur="4.74">branches was ways of preventing</text><text start="3353.52" dur="3.9">centralized failure modes yeah and they</text><text start="3356.28" dur="3.24">didn&apos;t just do three branches like the</text><text start="3357.42" dur="3.54">Mad the Mad King idea right just</text><text start="3359.52" dur="3.18">somebody going totally off the rails and</text><text start="3360.96" dur="3.42">having unchecked power or even the</text><text start="3362.7" dur="3.18">emperor has no clothes situation where</text><text start="3364.38" dur="4.439">it&apos;s not that they&apos;re Idi Amin and</text><text start="3365.88" dur="4.679">they&apos;re have really really nasty</text><text start="3368.819" dur="3.54">but where they are</text><text start="3370.559" dur="4.141">uh</text><text start="3372.359" dur="4.021">in a distortion bubble where they have a</text><text start="3374.7" dur="3.18">bunch of Yes Men and a court around them</text><text start="3376.38" dur="3.42">they just can&apos;t tell what&apos;s true and the</text><text start="3377.88" dur="3.959">thing is failing for those reasons right</text><text start="3379.8" dur="5.759">so the idea of like</text><text start="3381.839" dur="6.181">a centralized system can have</text><text start="3385.559" dur="5.221">bad intent at the top it can have</text><text start="3388.02" dur="4.26">mistakes at the top it can have modes of</text><text start="3390.78" dur="3.36">capture at the top for others who have</text><text start="3392.28" dur="3.0">bad intent who aren&apos;t currently there so</text><text start="3394.14" dur="3.719">let&apos;s just keep it from being</text><text start="3395.28" dur="5.64">centralized so there&apos;s some type of</text><text start="3397.859" dur="4.5">um stability and the two alone can&apos;t do</text><text start="3400.92" dur="2.88">that which is why the two-party system</text><text start="3402.359" dur="3.48">gets so is it ends up just</text><text start="3403.8" dur="3.48">driving polarization so you have to be</text><text start="3405.839" dur="3.24">able to have something like this</text><text start="3407.28" dur="3.96">three-body problem of you know having</text><text start="3409.079" dur="4.201">them check each other

dur="4.321">even if the previous system was well</text><text start="3528.96" dur="3.48">intact it would be insufficient for</text><text start="3530.94" dur="2.76">various reasons and we didn&apos;t start to</text><text start="3532.44" dur="5.58">lay out all those reasons but it would</text><text start="3533.7" dur="7.08">be insufficient we can say things like</text><text start="3538.02" dur="4.02">we don&apos;t have ways of ensuring that the</text><text start="3540.78" dur="2.46">representatives are representing the</text><text start="3542.04" dur="2.94">people because we don&apos;t have everybody</text><text start="3543.24" dur="4.98">going to town halls and because of</text><text start="3544.98" dur="5.099">smallness of scale type issues and we</text><text start="3548.22" dur="3.72">um don&apos;t and the fact that you would</text><text start="3550.079" dur="3.48">regulate after the facts because of the</text><text start="3551.94" dur="2.7">speed of tech being so slow doesn&apos;t work</text><text start="3553.559" dur="2.52">anymore so there&apos;s like a few things</text><text start="3554.64" dur="3.12">where it&apos;s like even if that system was</text><text start="3556.079" dur="3.78">intact it&apos;s no longer an adequate system</text><text start="3557.76" dur="4.38">or the thing like it needed a fourth</text><text start="3559.859" dur="3.96">estate to

that</text><text start="3565.559" dur="4.5">system has eroded profoundly</text><text start="3568.38" dur="3.84">um and so both of those things are</text><text start="3570.059" dur="4.681">simultaneously true because it&apos;s eroded</text><text start="3572.22" dur="4.56">so profoundly we know some major changes</text><text start="3574.74" dur="4.619">to governance are

a</text><text start="3683.94" dur="3.78">model do you want to just play this</text><text start="3685.859" dur="4.081">through and kind of lay out what you</text><text start="3687.72" dur="3.899">think

dur="3.899">potentially corrupt or captured powers</text><text start="3713.4" dur="3.679">and interests that are running the old</text><text start="3714.839" dur="4.621">system</text><text start="3717.079" dur="4.421">Yeah It&apos;s Tricky if we were to say how</text><text start="3719.46" dur="4.379">do you def how do you design an ideal</text><text start="3721.5" dur="3.72">system from scratch even if you come up</text><text start="3723.839" dur="2.641">with a good design obviously it&apos;ll</text><text start="3725.22" dur="3.42">probably be wrong but let&apos;s even say we</text><text start="3726.48" dur="4.44">came up with a really good design how do</text><text start="3728.64" dur="4.38">you do enactments and this is where a</text><text start="3730.92" dur="4.379">lot of people like the people in the</text><text start="3733.02" dur="4.38">teal Circle become libertarian is</text><text start="3735.299" dur="3.721">they&apos;re like your utopian ideals take so</text><text start="3737.4" dur="3.12">much violence to enact in the presence</text><text start="3739.02" dur="3.539">of all of the vested interests that</text><text start="3740.52" dur="3.12">don&apos;t want them is it still a Utopia</text><text start="3742.559" dur="3.361">after you committed the amount of</text><text start="3743.64" dur="5.88">violence needed to enact it</text><text start="3745.92" dur="5.879">um that&apos;s the sheikhavara Paradox right</text><text start="3749.52" dur="4.079">yeah exactly I mean he starts out as a</text><text start="3751.799" dur="3.54">starts out as a as a bleeding hot</text><text start="3753.599" dur="3.72">do-gooder you know doctor on a</text><text start="3755.339" dur="3.24">motorcycle and ends up capping people

dur="2.779">um and</text><text start="3771.72" dur="4.44">the other so the the other direction is</text><text start="3774.0" dur="4.319">not design a perfect system and then be</text><text start="3776.16" dur="3.659">stuck with enactment problems the other</text><text start="3778.319" dur="3.48">way is</text><text start="3779.819" dur="3.24">what is intelligible to the current</text><text start="3781.799" dur="2.76">system</text><text start="3783.059" dur="4.081">they could Vector it in the right</text><text start="3784.559" dur="5.161">direction and can those

start="3791.099" dur="3.48">like to do both of those and have them</text><text start="3793.079" dur="3.54">enter inform each other because I do</text><text start="3794.579" dur="4.861">think there are certain</text><text start="3796.619" dur="6.48">risks that are clear and eminent enough</text><text start="3799.44" dur="5.04">that they require acting and where the</text><text start="3803.099" dur="3.541">forcing function of them can make</text><text start="3804.48" dur="3.48">certain action occur they can also move</text><text start="3806.64" dur="3.3">us in a fundamentally

start="3816.059" dur="3.06">will take a lot to construct some of</text><text start="3817.68" dur="3.6">these things</text><text start="3819.119" dur="4.44">let me let me construct one other thing</text><text start="3821.28" dur="3.539">first when I was saying that at the time</text><text start="3823.559" dur="2.941">of the</text><text start="3824.819" dur="3.3">U.S democracy and the other kind of</text><text start="3826.5" dur="3.78">modern European Democracies were roughly</text><text start="3828.119" dur="3.841">in a similar-ish Time</text><text start="3830.28" dur="3.779">but let&apos;s take the US democracy</text><text start="3831.96" dur="4.44">obviously the critique is also pretty</text><text start="3834.059" dur="4.321">clear that the</text><text start="3836.4" dur="4.02">the political economy right you can&apos;t</text><text start="3838.38" dur="4.679">separate the government and the economic</text><text start="3840.42" dur="3.659">system the the those things are embedded</text><text start="3843.059" dur="2.52">especially when it&apos;s something like</text><text start="3844.079" dur="4.22">liberal democracy that&apos;s trying to make</text><text start="3845.579" dur="6.661">the market do most things</text><text start="3848.299" dur="5.381">it uh it did depend upon genocide and</text><text start="3852.24" dur="3.48">slavery right it was not a political</text><text start="3853.68" dur="5.1">economy that worked without the most</text><text start="3855.72" dur="6.06">gruesome things and then it only</text><text start="3858.78" dur="4.68">we can only kind of say slavery ended</text><text start="3861.78" dur="4.14">when you actually really look at the</text><text start="3863.46" dur="5.04">history of the pnh indentured servitude</text><text start="3865.92" dur="4.8">system following and like that but also</text><text start="3868.5" dur="4.2">it was able to kind of start to end</text><text start="3870.72" dur="4.02">because of fossil fuel slaves because of</text><text start="3872.7" dur="3.3">the Industrial Revolution and then this</text><text start="3874.74" dur="3.0">gets us into the Nate stuff we were</text><text start="3876.0" dur="3.72">talking about earlier which was oh now</text><text start="3877.74" dur="3.72">rather than extract from another race we</text><text start="3879.72" dur="4.02">can extract from nature radically faster</text><text start="3881.46" dur="4.26">than is possible to produce enough</text><text start="3883.74" dur="3.839">abundance that this kind of system works</text><text start="3885.72" dur="3.359">this is another one of the ideas of why</text><text start="3887.579" dur="3.24">this is a short-term one of what like</text><text start="3889.079" dur="3.24">Whitney calls the carbon spike a very</text><text start="3890.819" dur="3.361">short period of time where the abundance</text><text start="3892.319" dur="4.76">went way up from anything it had ever</text><text start="3894.18" dur="4.98">been where you can have people happier</text><text start="3897.079" dur="3.401">with whatever the system is because</text><text start="3899.16" dur="3.3">you&apos;re creating so much distributed</text><text start="3900.48" dur="3.24">abundance of certain kinds that everyone</text><text start="3902.46" dur="2.94">feels like well at least it keeps</text><text start="3903.72" dur="4.139">getting better every year but in a way</text><text start="3905.4" dur="4.14">that is fundamentally not continuous and</text><text start="3907.859" dur="3.96">actually self-terminating</text><text start="3909.54" dur="4.079">yeah well I mean and that&apos;s worth</text><text start="3911.819" dur="4.74">talking about right because if because</text><text start="3913.619" dur="5.0">all modern political Theory economic</text><text start="3916.559" dur="4.56">theory I mean I mean Friedman Hayek the</text><text start="3918.619" dur="4.841">austrians you name it any and you know</text><text start="3921.119" dur="3.661">all the way to Keynes and and and the</text><text start="3923.46" dur="2.7">new economic whatever the</text><text start="3924.78" dur="2.88">quantitative easing just print more</text><text start="3926.16" dur="3.3">money because Keynes was basically like</text><text start="3927.66" dur="3.36">hey you you can&apos;t ever print too much</text><text start="3929.46" dur="3.359">money provided you can deliver on the</text><text start="3931.02" dur="3.66">Investments right but there was that</text><text start="3932.819" dur="3.54">huge key asterisk of provided you can</text><text start="3934.68" dur="4.139">deliver on the investment right and</text><text start="3936.359" dur="4.381">sociological consideration on that yeah</text><text start="3938.819" dur="4.381">and and but all of that was within that</text><text start="3940.74" dur="3.9">carbon pulse so it was basically like we</text><text start="3943.2" dur="3.54">were trying to do sleep and Physiology</text><text start="3944.64" dur="3.719">tests you know when everybody was given</text><text start="3946.74" dur="2.76">an eight ball to go you know to go home</text><text start="3948.359" dur="3.061">for the weekend and you&apos;re like okay</text><text start="3949.5" dur="4.38">none of this is actually more human</text><text start="3951.42" dur="4.379">nature tests on ubiquitous lead yeah</text><text start="3953.88" dur="3.479">yeah yeah so so one of the things that</text><text start="3955.799" dur="2.52">Nate has said that I think is is really</text><text start="3957.359" dur="3.24">memorable I mean you&apos;re talking about</text><text start="3958.319" dur="3.901">slavery right because because there is a</text><text start="3960.599" dur="3.421">there is a strong argument Yale</text><text start="3962.22" dur="3.72">historian Evan Morgan made it American</text><text

start="3973.26" dur="3.48">United States it&apos;s not until you get to</text><text start="3974.88" dur="4.739">the mid 19th century with the Advent of</text><text start="3976.74" dur="4.98">coal and

were</text><text start="5348.219" dur="2.581">talking about the problem of the</text><text start="5349.179" dur="3.241">financial system having an exponential</text><text start="5350.8"

that on a</text><text start="5355.6" dur="4.38">finite planet with a open loop materials</text><text start="5357.699" dur="4.02">economy but the financial system also</text><text start="5359.98" dur="3.42">even deeper</text><text start="5361.719" dur="4.5">if you</text><text start="5363.4" dur="4.02">have your assessment of value all</text><text start="5366.219" dur="3.841">quantitative</text><text start="5367.42" dur="5.819">and a single quanta</text><text start="5370.06" dur="4.92">right dollars then the value of</text><text start="5373.239" dur="3.301">everything that is qualitative gets</text><text start="5374.98" dur="4.32">converted to quantitative what will the</text><text start="5376.54" dur="4.74">market bear and all different

start="5404.26" dur="3.959">like no they&apos;re fundamentally different</text><text start="5406.0" dur="4.739">things those quanta are those those</text><text start="5408.219" dur="4.92">metrics are un inter-exchangeable with</text><text start="5410.739" dur="3.9">each other but when you determine the</text><text start="5413.139" dur="4.56">market-based value of all of them in a</text><text start="5414.639" dur="4.681">single metric then rather than maintain</text><text start="5417.699" dur="4.081">each of them with their own accounting</text><text start="5419.32" dur="4.5">and logic that they need where you</text><text start="5421.78" dur="4.2">maximize extraction externalization is</text><text start="5423.82" dur="3.96">where the logic of the dollars ends up</text><text

more power</text><text start="5436.06" dur="4.26">in the system so those that have the</text><text start="5438.52" dur="4.139">most perverse value system end up</text><text start="5440.32" dur="3.96">winning and determining the system so</text><text start="5442.659" dur="4.681">the future system won&apos;t have something</text><text start="5444.28" dur="4.68">like a single fungible metrified</text><text start="5447.34" dur="3.72">currency</text><text start="5448.96" dur="3.719">that&apos;s really different that&apos;s</text><text start="5451.06" dur="2.76">so different right because then if you</text><text start="5452.679" dur="2.641">say okay well we&apos;ll have lots of</text><text start="5453.82" dur="3.72">different currencies for different</text><text start="5455.32" dur="4.319">things well if there&apos;s an exchange</text><text start="5457.54" dur="4.8">between them then you end up still</text><text start="5459.639" dur="4.981">getting one Quantified I mean one one</text><text start="5462.34" dur="5.22">thing so who&apos;s your reserve currency</text><text start="5464.62" dur="4.74">that everything is scissors</text><text start="5467.56" dur="3.06">so that&apos;s an example again of like oh</text><text start="5469.36" dur="3.779">the future things we&apos;re talking about</text><text start="5470.62" dur="4.2">are really really different and there</text><text start="5473.139" dur="3.0">are so many of these and it&apos;s important</text><text start="5474.82" dur="3.66">if we&apos;re going to try to talk about how</text><text start="5476.139" dur="3.841">to design a future because if we if we</text><text start="5478.48" dur="2.88">were just talking about these issues</text><text start="5479.98" dur="4.14">that we&apos;ve talked about so far regarding</text><text start="5481.36" dur="4.799">the global Mega machine and energy and</text><text start="5484.12" dur="4.32">like that and we weren&apos;t recognizing</text><text start="5486.159" dur="5.101">that we&apos;re within a single digit number</text><text start="5488.44" dur="4.92">of years from tabletop Gene synthesizers</text><text start="5491.26" dur="4.14">in basements which actually I think gets</text><text start="5493.36" dur="4.44">us to globalizing catastrophes faster</text><text start="5495.4" dur="3.6">than these other globalized things do we</text><text start="5497.8" dur="3.72">wouldn&apos;t have to focus on regulating</text><text start="5499.0" dur="4.38">exponential Tech that fast or the</text><text start="5501.52" dur="3.48">exponential Tech applied to AI applied</text><text start="5503.38" dur="4.14">to population-centric kind of warfare</text><text start="5505.0" dur="4.5">and mind control so it&apos;s all this</text><text start="5507.52" dur="3.719">at once right and that&apos;s the important</text><text start="5509.5" dur="3.54">thing most everybody gets overwhelmed</text><text start="5511.239" dur="5.041">with one of them and then over indexes</text><text start="5513.04" dur="4.56">everything on that thing and but the</text><text start="5516.28" dur="3.66">solution to that thing makes other</text><text start="5517.6" dur="4.26">problems worse most of the time</text><text start="5519.94" dur="3.719">sure but this is this is this is the</text><text start="5521.86" dur="3.96">schmachtenberger effect right like like</text><text start="5523.659" dur="4.5">listening to you and listening to your</text><text start="5525.82" dur="4.64">credible running down all the threads</text><text start="5528.159" dur="5.101">and all of them being self-terminating</text><text start="5530.46" dur="5.56">my sense as let&apos;s say just as a listener</text><text start="5533.26" dur="5.16">right is like I either slit my wrist or</text><text start="5536.02" dur="5.34">I gather my loved ones and I off to</text><text start="5538.42" dur="5.759">the Deep Woods because none of this is</text><text start="5541.36" dur="5.52">solvable given how we&apos;ve done so far</text><text start="5544.179" dur="6.121">yeah I think it is unsolvable actually</text><text start="5546.88" dur="4.68">and so thank you for bringing this up</text><text start="5550.3" dur="3.06">um</text><text start="5551.56" dur="4.2">something I find interesting in the</text><text start="5553.36" dur="5.4">current thinking environment the as you</text><text start="5555.76" dur="6.0">mentioned of everybody being kind of</text><text start="5558.76" dur="4.62">deeper and not clear thinking rabbit</text><text start="5561.76" dur="4.14">holes one of the other things I&apos;ve</text><text start="5563.38" dur="4.98">noticed is that it&apos;s very common for</text><text start="5565.9" dur="4.259">people currently to go from high</text><text start="5568.36" dur="4.2">epistemic certainty to when that&apos;s</text><text start="5570.159" dur="5.101">challenged adequately epistemic nihilism</text><text start="5572.56" dur="5.639">in one step like they&apos;re super certain</text><text start="5575.26" dur="5.22">about whatever the thing is regarding</text><text start="5578.199" dur="5.161">um covet or climate change or</text><text start="5580.48" dur="4.739">institutional racism or whatever and if</text><text start="5583.36" dur="3.359">some and mostly they&apos;re closed to having</text><text start="5585.219" dur="3.601">their child&apos;s thinking their their</text><text start="5586.719" dur="4.381">thinking challenged at all but if you do</text><text start="5588.82" dur="3.54">adequately challenge it including the</text><text start="5591.1" dur="2.88">solution that they have hope in because</text><text start="5592.36" dur="4.08">as you know as you bring up people need</text><text start="5593.98" dur="3.96">hope if you challenge the hey Renewables</text><text start="5596.44" dur="2.94">aren&apos;t going to get us there in time to</text><text start="5597.94" dur="4.08">solve the climate change problem because</text><text start="5599.38" dur="5.22">dot dot or whatever it is they go to</text><text start="5602.02" dur="4.44">I don&apos;t know what&apos;s true and but</text><text start="5604.6" dur="3.9">not let go that&apos;s interesting let&apos;s work</text><text start="5606.46" dur="4.259">on that and figure it out but like a</text><text start="5608.5" dur="4.739">give up right annihilism and you can&apos;t</text><text start="5610.719" dur="4.081">go from certainty to nihilism and</text><text start="5613.239" dur="3.541">possibly have any chance of being a part</text><text start="5614.8" dur="3.839">of the solution or being part of</text><text start="5616.78" dur="3.419">solution you have to be able to say I</text><text start="5618.639" dur="3.781">don&apos;t have anything close to adequate</text><text start="5620.199" dur="4.321">certainty but that also means I don&apos;t</text><text start="5622.42" dur="4.739">have adequate certainty that the whole</text><text start="5624.52" dur="4.38">thing is inexorably I should I</text><text start="5627.159" dur="3.181">should not have certainty about what the</text><text

dur="3.119"> I don&apos;t know and there might be a</text><text start="5640.42" dur="3.12">lot of Solutions in there if I don&apos;t</text><text start="5642.159" dur="2.881">know the problem space well I won&apos;t even</text><text start="5643.54" dur="3.3">know how to recognize them because I&apos;ll</text><text start="5645.04" dur="3.3">think the thing that just solves the</text><text start="5646.84" dur="3.0">tiny part of the problem space I</text><text start="5648.34" dur="3.42">currently know is a good answer and it</text><text start="5649.84" dur="3.6">externalize and harms somewhere else so</text><text start="5651.76" dur="3.06">I need to actually be willing to engage</text><text start="5653.44" dur="3.239">in understanding the problem space</text><text start="5654.82" dur="3.18">better so I can recognize good Solutions</text><text start="5656.679" dur="2.401">and then I have to be engaged and</text><text start="5658.0" dur="2.04">working hard to figure out what those</text><text start="5659.08" dur="5.099">might be</text><text start="5660.04" dur="6.659">so I think the people</text><text start="5664.179" dur="5.401">like people&apos;s</text><text

almost</text><text start="7037.639" dur="5.821">um it&apos;s almost people overreaching</text><text start="7040.76" dur="4.56">for too much complexity too much scope</text><text start="7043.46"

there&apos;s no national</text><text start="8210.46" dur="3.84">parks and up stuff so we&apos;re going</text><text start="8211.96" dur="3.78">to have some state that has some law to</text><text

right now</text><text start="8278.139" dur="4.08">for understandable Reasons I&apos;m saying we</text><text start="8280.599" dur="3.781">need to rebuild the institutions in a</text><text

start="9189.6" dur="4.56">much power under the current extractive</text><text start="9191.88" dur="4.439">and coordination failure Dynamics leads</text><text start="9194.16" dur="3.9">to

dur="4.92">planetary wide coordination without the</text><text start="9206.34" dur="3.059">tools to be able to do that so</text><text start="9208.68" dur="4.139">um</text><text start="9209.399" dur="5.761">so yeah I do think that if I take all of</text><text start="9212.819" dur="4.561">the failure modes that I know of all the</text><text start="9215.16" dur="5.46">self-terminating things I take the</text><text start="9217.38" dur="5.76">timelines Associated and then I say is</text><text start="9220.62" dur="4.14">there any path through this that is both</text><text start="9223.14" dur="3.54">feasible with physics it doesn&apos;t require</text><text start="9224.76" dur="3.12">replicators and die lithium crystals and</text><text start="9226.68" dur="3.06">stuff it&apos;s like feasible with physics</text><text start="9227.88" dur="3.42">and it&apos;s feasible with human nature and</text><text start="9229.74" dur="2.88">assuming we condition people differently</text><text start="9231.3" dur="4.019">but I don&apos;t have to assume that everyone</text><text start="9232.62" dur="4.08">has an IQ of 2000 and are omnibenevolent</text><text start="9235.319" dur="4.441">to begin with</text><text start="9236.7" dur="4.86">yes I absolutely believe there are</text><text start="9239.76" dur="3.179">models that are adequate that are both</text><text start="9241.56" dur="3.419">possible with physics and possible with</text><text start="9242.939" dur="3.601">human nature I believe they&apos;re threading</text><text start="9244.979" dur="3.241">the eye of a needle I believe there are</text><text start="9246.54" dur="4.02">way more ways it fails</text><text start="9248.22" dur="3.54">but I believe that the likelihood for it</text><text start="9250.56" dur="2.82">to succeed is the people who are</text><text start="9251.76" dur="2.76">oriented to how we make it through the</text><text start="9253.38" dur="2.34">eye of the needle and dedicate their</text><text start="9254.52" dur="2.879">whole lives not to asking the question</text><text start="9255.72" dur="4.44">do we or not but how does my life</text><text start="9257.399" dur="3.841">increase the likelihood that it does</text><text start="9260.16" dur="3.659">um</text><text start="9261.24" dur="4.98">beautiful so yeah that notion of leaving</text><text start="9263.819" dur="4.08">space for Grace right the idea that if</text><text start="9266.22" dur="3.24">there is there is always that Miracle</text><text start="9267.899" dur="3.061">element and Kevin Kelly has that</text><text start="9269.46" dur="3.899">beautiful quote where he&apos;s like it&apos;s way</text><text start="9270.96" dur="4.26">easier to imagine the devil than God</text><text start="9273.359" dur="3.96">because of basically second law of</text><text start="9275.22" dur="4.02">Thermodynamics but yeah everything</text><text start="9277.319" dur="4.561">awesome from the flowers to you and me</text><text start="9279.24" dur="6.26">are highly improbable and we have to get</text><text start="9281.88" dur="3.62">better at believing in the improbable</text><text start="9286.02" dur="3.24">foreign</text><text start="9286.859" dur="5.101">yeah and and feeling it even before we</text><text start="9289.26" dur="4.38">have a thing to believe in</text><text start="9291.96" dur="3.479">and then the other thing is I don&apos;t</text><text start="9293.64" dur="3.36">believe that humanity is going to make</text><text start="9295.439" dur="4.221">it I also don&apos;t believe it&apos;s not going</text><text start="9297.0" dur="4.62">to make it I know either could happen</text><text start="9299.66" dur="4.18">and my</text><text start="9301.62" dur="3.42">my disposition is not just because I&apos;m</text><text start="9303.84" dur="4.019">sure we&apos;re going to make it so I have</text><text start="9305.04" dur="5.34">that certainty it&apos;s that I&apos;m sure that I</text><text start="9307.859" dur="4.741">want my life oriented to what could help</text><text start="9310.38" dur="4.68">it happen and I know that everyone who&apos;s</text><text start="9312.6" dur="4.08">sure that we aren&apos;t has unwarranted</text><text start="9315.06" dur="3.78">certainty</text><text start="9316.68" dur="5.46">and disconnection from the life force</text><text start="9318.84" dur="4.92">yes yes and then so the other thing is I</text><text start="9322.14" dur="3.54">want my life oriented to the best</text><text start="9323.76" dur="3.54">possible future but I also want it</text><text start="9325.68" dur="3.84">oriented to the most honoring of life</text><text start="9327.3" dur="3.36">now so if we don&apos;t make it I still</text><text start="9329.52" dur="3.66">wouldn&apos;t change any of how I&apos;m living</text><text start="9330.66" dur="5.34">because it is coming from the like</text><text start="9333.18" dur="4.92">recognition of the radical amazing that</text><text start="9336.0" dur="3.78">I get to be alive for a second at all</text><text start="9338.1" dur="2.46">right like I had this experience this is</text><text start="9339.78" dur="3.0">so</text><text start="9340.56" dur="4.68">fundamental is like</text><text start="9342.78" dur="5.22">I remember when I was a teenager looking</text><text start="9345.24" dur="5.76">at a sunset</text><text start="9348.0" dur="4.439">and feeling this experience of like I</text><text start="9351.0" dur="2.58">would incarnate this life and I&apos;d go</text><text start="9352.439" dur="3.301">through every hell and</text><text start="9353.58" dur="4.14">difficulty for this moment because it&apos;s</text><text start="9355.74" dur="4.739">so like as opposed to no experience at</text><text start="9357.72" dur="4.38">all ever like it&apos;s so incredible</text><text start="9360.479" dur="4.441">and then I&apos;m like I&apos;ve already had</text><text start="9362.1" dur="5.219">thousands of moments like that</text><text start="9364.92" dur="4.38">and if they&apos;re if I&apos;ve had thousands of</text><text start="9367.319" dur="3.901">moments that are worth an entire life</text><text start="9369.3" dur="4.019">it&apos;s all gravy from here in terms of</text><text start="9371.22" dur="3.78">what&apos;s in it for me right like it just</text><text start="9373.319" dur="3.181">keeps being this embarrassment of riches</text><text start="9375.0" dur="3.12">that the beauty of Life keeps happening</text><text start="9376.5" dur="3.12">and it&apos;s all worth it</text><text start="9378.12" dur="5.239">and that doesn&apos;t mean the pain isn&apos;t</text><text start="9379.62" dur="3.739">painful it just means like</text><text start="9383.58" dur="3.0">I&apos;ve experienced pain as it works</text><text start="9385.26" dur="2.52">cruciating and I can&apos;t feel them right</text><text start="9386.58" dur="3.3">now</text><text start="9387.78" dur="3.96">and I don&apos;t choose to dwell on them and</text><text start="9389.88" dur="4.559">I&apos;ve experienced beauties that were</text><text start="9391.74" dur="5.1">awe-inspiring and I do dwell on them</text><text start="9394.439" dur="4.861">and so it&apos;s worth it right and so</text><text start="9396.84" dur="3.9">there&apos;s also a like if we don&apos;t make it</text><text start="9399.3" dur="2.88">I don&apos;t just want to be partying in the</text><text start="9400.74" dur="3.54">Bahamas I want to be in like sacred</text><text

dur="2.601">actually makes sense</text><text start="9411.3" dur="3.54">beautiful well I mean and that feels</text><text start="9413.58" dur="2.34">very</text><text start="9414.84" dur="3.96">um</text><text start="9415.92" dur="5.66">resonant with the Arjuna Krishna story</text><text start="9418.8" dur="5.099">in in the bhagavad-gita right some</text><text start="9421.58" dur="5.14">reconciliation with the impossibility of</text><text start="9423.899" dur="5.821">this thing and also</text><text start="9426.72" dur="4.679">um that we&apos;re never off the hook

ethic</text><text start="9436.02" dur="4.62">right it&apos;s a virtue ethic which says the</text><text start="9438.359" dur="4.741">utilitarian ethic says I can calculate</text><text start="9440.64" dur="3.96">the possible future States and choose an</text><text start="9443.1" dur="3.0">action based on the best utilitarian</text><text start="9444.6" dur="3.0">outcome except you and I both know that</text><text start="9446.1" dur="2.94">we can&apos;t know what the wind is going to</text><text start="9447.6" dur="4.5">be 10 days from now because</text><text start="9449.04" dur="4.859">complex systems are unpredictable and so</text><text start="9452.1" dur="4.08">I want to do utilitating calculus where</text><text start="9453.899" dur="3.661">I can but I also want to say if I can&apos;t</text><text start="9456.18" dur="3.36">predict the future</text><text start="9457.56" dur="4.259">each moment is unfolding from this</text><text start="9459.54" dur="4.2">moment and

way</text><text start="9476.58" dur="3.6">this moment is lived and the</text><text start="9478.439" dur="3.361">bhagavad-gita is just like the whole</text><text start="9480.18" dur="2.94">thing is understanding that Dharma let</text><text start="9481.8" dur="3.42">go of the fruits of action and do what</text><text start="9483.12" dur="4.199">is right because you know it&apos;s right</text><text start="9485.22" dur="3.84">yeah which also feels like why Yoda can</text><text start="9487.319" dur="3.061">never like call like eight ball Corner</text><text start="9489.06" dur="3.24">Pocket

but it</text><text start="9493.979" dur="5.041">is a dynamic flow of a complex system</text><text start="9496.859" dur="3.781">right so so yeah</text><text start="9499.02" dur="3.18">um because Yoda

start="9568.5" dur="4.08">it ends up in Mount Doom and destroyed</text><text start="9570.72" dur="4.08">so you&apos;re sort of like and that&apos;s what I</text><text start="9572.58" dur="3.779">mean about the the space for Grace right</text><text start="9574.8" dur="3.48">we don&apos;t know and I feel like you&apos;re</text><text start="9576.359" dur="5.46">echoing that really strongly we cannot</text><text start="9578.28" dur="5.28">with certainty predict what happens next</text><text start="9581.819" dur="4.321">and if I&apos;m hearing you right what you&apos;re</text><text start="9583.56" dur="5.4">saying is the only thing I can do is act</text><text start="9586.14" dur="5.7">from The Chew act from love act from</text><text start="9588.96" dur="5.519">defense of and and and and bearing</text><text start="9591.84" dur="5.22">witness to life in this moment and the</text><text start="9594.479" dur="5.88">next moment and the next and perhaps</text><text start="9597.06" dur="4.799">right if there is a path to Salvation if</text><text start="9600.359" dur="2.821">there is a path to Redemption it lies</text><text start="9601.859" dur="3.721">that way</text><text start="9603.18" dur="4.32">and and we cannot see it from here but</text><text start="9605.58" dur="4.44">if but if we keep the faith in it um</text><text start="9607.5" dur="4.26">that is essential for us ever arriving</text><text start="9610.02" dur="3.66">yeah</text><text start="9611.76" dur="4.26">yeah totally</text><text start="9613.68" dur="3.9">and when the Fellowship of the Ring came</text><text start="9616.02" dur="3.0">together they knew the task was most</text><text start="9617.58" dur="2.94">likely impossible</text><text start="9619.02" dur="3.6">and they didn&apos;t know exactly how it</text><text start="9620.52" dur="4.799">unfold and there was also wisdom that</text><text start="9622.62" dur="4.02">guided that it was the right thing to do</text><text start="9625.319" dur="3.721">it needed to happen</text><text start="9626.64" dur="4.32">yeah all right so before I off and</text><text start="9629.04" dur="3.0">sail sail west over the ocean at the end</text><text start="9630.96" dur="3.0">of Middle Earth</text><text start="9632.04" dur="2.7">um I will hang out I will hang out with</text><text start="9633.96" dur="3.6">you</text><text start="9634.74" dur="5.04">um optimistic and Rosie one</text><text start="9637.56" dur="3.9">it&apos;s weird to be</text><text start="9639.78" dur="3.06">you know this is actually this is</text><text start="9641.46" dur="4.56">interesting Nate and I talked about this</text><text start="9642.84" dur="4.86">recently where a lot of the people</text><text start="9646.02" dur="3.78">that I not everybody I don&apos;t want to</text><text start="9647.7" dur="5.4">make any general relations that are too</text><text start="9649.8" dur="4.62">sweeping but some people get into being</text><text start="9653.1" dur="2.82">very good at like thinking about</text><text start="9654.42" dur="3.3">catastrophic risks because their</text><text start="9655.92" dur="4.5">disposition is that they catastrophized</text><text start="9657.72" dur="4.259">like in the CBT sense of like running</text><text start="9660.42" dur="4.019">worst case all the time in their</text><text start="9661.979" dur="4.441">own personal life but then smart and</text><text start="9664.439" dur="3.841">they end up the good side the gift of</text><text start="9666.42" dur="3.72">that is that they&apos;re able to think about</text><text start="9668.28" dur="3.18">how could this Tech really mess stuff up</text><text start="9670.14" dur="5.42">and how could this agreement get</text><text start="9671.46" dur="4.1">up and how could this be gamed and</text><text start="9675.78" dur="3.539">um</text><text start="9676.5" dur="4.68">but it&apos;s also that that&apos;s the gift of it</text><text start="9679.319" dur="3.421">but they&apos;re that disposition is not</text><text start="9681.18" dur="2.759">oriented to find Solutions it&apos;s oriented</text><text start="9682.74" dur="3.0">to find what&apos;s wrong with any possible</text><text start="9683.939" dur="2.88">solution I was talking with a different</text><text start="9685.74" dur="3.72">friend the other day and I&apos;m like look</text><text start="9686.819" dur="5.701">every time I tell you a new possible</text><text start="9689.46" dur="5.04">catastrophic risk you without a lot of</text><text start="9692.52" dur="3.9">rigorous analysis you just believe me</text><text start="9694.5" dur="3.42">that that&apos;s probably going to happen</text><text start="9696.42" dur="3.0">and every time I tell you a possible</text><text start="9697.92" dur="2.58">solution you&apos;re like what&apos;s wrong with</text><text start="9699.42" dur="2.22">that what&apos;s wrong with that until you</text><text start="9700.5" dur="3.12">find something possibly wrong with it</text><text start="9701.64" dur="3.839">that&apos;s a bias you&apos;re running because why</text><text start="9703.62" dur="3.72">don&apos;t you wonder what could be why don&apos;t</text><text start="9705.479" dur="3.181">you just as rigorously analyze the</text><text start="9707.34" dur="4.62">catastrophic risk of why that probably</text><text start="9708.66" dur="5.1">won&apos;t happen there&apos;s a and so</text><text start="9711.96" dur="4.32">I</text><text start="9713.76" dur="3.719">and if one is oriented to catastrophize</text><text start="9716.28" dur="2.64">they won&apos;t coordinate with other people</text><text start="9717.479" dur="2.701">for because they&apos;ll catastrophize</text><text start="9718.92" dur="3.0">the relationships and assume that</text><text start="9720.18" dur="3.24">everyone is them and just doing</text><text start="9721.92" dur="4.439">it for game theoretic power just virtue</text><text start="9723.42" dur="4.019">signaling and everything else and so you</text><text start="9726.359" dur="3.301">actually have to overcome</text><text start="9727.439" dur="3.781">catastrophizing in one&apos;s own self to</text><text start="9729.66" dur="2.4">actually be in service to catastrophe as</text><text start="9731.22" dur="2.58">well</text><text start="9732.06" dur="3.72">to be able to think through them and yet</text><text start="9733.8" dur="3.24">be oriented to Solutions and oriented to</text><text start="9735.78" dur="3.36">collaborate with other people so it&apos;s</text><text start="9737.04" dur="3.66">weird to be in a place of like no we</text><text start="9739.14" dur="3.9">really want to understand all the things</text><text start="9740.7" dur="4.26">that are so we can address them</text><text start="9743.04" dur="5.04">but it is so we can address them and</text><text start="9744.96" dur="6.2">that&apos;s both the show we

dur="3.72">end we can kind of go back and I&apos;ll send</text><text start="9787.859" dur="3.481">all the ones I can remember</text><text start="9789.6" dur="2.879">that sounds great and then just just an</text><text start="9791.34" dur="3.24">encouragement</text><text start="9792.479" dur="4.5">um that out of all of this complexity</text><text start="9794.58" dur="4.859">the Simplicity on the
