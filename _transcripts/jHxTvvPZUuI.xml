particularly in the citadel,</text><text start="17.42" dur="7.17">Google, because I think
the broad cultural force</text><text start="24.59" dur="3.63">that intelligent,
rational, technologically</text><text start="28.22" dur="7.08">sophisticated, scientifically
innovative players are</text><text start="35.3" dur="3.81">able to bring to our
world is so crucial</text><text start="39.11" dur="2.61">and right now, so
under utilized.</text><text start="41.72" dur="2.94">I think we have a
huge opportunity.</text><text start="44.66" dur="2.49">You have a huge
opportunity, and frankly,</text><text start="47.15" dur="2.01">as you&apos;ll hear a responsibility.</text><text start="49.16" dur="4.47">And I&apos;ll be talking about
how the challenges are not</text><text start="53.63" dur="2.85">really just problems
to be figured out,</text><text start="56.48" dur="3.12">but they&apos;re an
existential challenge</text><text start="59.6" dur="4.98">to our whole way of being human
and to our self understanding</text><text start="64.58" dur="1.42">and our orientation.</text><text start="66.0" dur="1.79">I&apos;ll get into that.</text><text start="67.79" dur="2.47">Mainly, I want to talk
about three things.</text><text start="70.26" dur="5.59">One of them is this
idea of a meta-crisis.</text><text start="75.85" dur="2.91">Very often, we talk
about global warming.</text><text start="78.76" dur="2.46">And perhaps, in
some conversations</text><text start="81.22" dur="2.43">we have a broader
view, and we talk</text><text start="83.65" dur="6.04">about the larger ecological
emergency, which isn&apos;t</text><text start="89.69" dur="2.89">reducible to global warming.</text><text start="92.58" dur="4.67">The destruction of so much of
the rainforest, for instance,</text><text start="97.25" dur="1.62">shrinking the
lungs of the planet</text><text start="98.87" dur="3.57">is not exactly the
same as global warming,</text><text start="102.44" dur="2.79">and this broader
ecological predicament</text><text start="105.23" dur="2.82">is a lot more severe
than people realize.</text><text start="108.05" dur="2.7">It&apos;s part of what
I want to express.</text><text start="110.75" dur="2.67">On the other hand, when
people have the courage</text><text start="113.42" dur="5.19">to face directly the
actual nature of our moment</text><text start="118.61" dur="3.84">and how dire it is in some ways.</text><text start="122.45" dur="5.52">It tends to bring about
an orientation of despair.</text><text start="127.97" dur="2.949">There&apos;s a huge community
that&apos;s grown up, for example,</text><text start="130.919" dur="2.931">around the idea of
civilizational collapse,</text><text start="133.85" dur="2.37">the idea that it is
inevitable that we</text><text start="136.22" dur="5.09">will see societal collapse
relatively near term.</text><text start="141.31" dur="1.93">I disagree with that,
and I&apos;ll be explaining</text><text start="143.24" dur="6.6">why that&apos;s not only
logically flawed, but morally</text><text start="149.84" dur="1.17">reprehensible.</text><text start="151.01" dur="5.16">And that&apos;s an important piece
of what I want to share.</text><text start="156.17" dur="3.45">However, what it boils
down to is an opportunity</text><text start="159.62" dur="4.08">and a challenge for
us each individually.</text><text start="163.7" dur="5.82">I often use the
metaphor of a zen koan.</text><text start="169.52" dur="4.92">This meta-crisis is an
impossible question.</text><text start="174.44" dur="3.89">Like in zen, the
monk is sometimes</text><text start="178.33" dur="2.07">given an impossible
question, like what</text><text start="180.4" dur="2.52">is the sound of
one hand clapping,</text><text start="182.92" dur="4.59">or show me your original
face, the one you had</text><text start="187.51" dur="3.35">before your parents were born.</text><text start="190.86" dur="3.33">And those questions
stop the mind,</text><text start="194.19" dur="3.9">and they and they
require the aspirant</text><text start="198.09" dur="2.55">to go beyond their
whole way of being.</text><text start="200.64" dur="3.93">It&apos;s a challenge that&apos;s
non-linear you can&apos;t figure out</text><text start="204.57" dur="1.89">the answer to a koan.</text><text start="206.46" dur="4.71">You have to dwell in the
tensions that the koan creates.</text><text start="211.17" dur="2.1">I think this crisis
represents that kind</text><text start="213.27" dur="2.91">of a transformational
pressure cooker</text><text start="216.18" dur="3.84">that admittedly, most of
humanity is busy ignoring</text><text start="220.02" dur="0.96">and not looking at.</text><text start="220.98" dur="3.9">We live in a culture
pretty profoundly dedicated</text><text start="224.88" dur="2.85">to a kind of radical denialism.</text><text start="227.73" dur="3.55">On the other hand, though, we
live in this time for a reason.</text><text start="231.28" dur="0.95">It is an opportunity.</text><text start="232.23" dur="4.33">And ultimately, I find it
thrilling and inspiring.</text><text start="236.56" dur="2.96">And I hope by the
end of this talk,</text><text start="239.52" dur="3.739">you&apos;ll be feeling the same way.</text><text start="243.259" dur="1.541">The second thing I
want to talk about</text><text start="244.8" dur="3.4">is a deeper dive into what
time it is on the planet</text><text start="248.2" dur="2.87">and what that means for us, the
nature of this tipping point,</text><text start="251.07" dur="4.18">as an existential matter.</text><text start="255.25" dur="1.97">And then finally, I
want to talk to you</text><text start="257.22" dur="3.6">about what the innovators--</text><text start="260.82" dur="2.64">and here at Google,
it&apos;s like a citadel</text><text start="263.46" dur="4.98">of what I call the innovators,
the unique role that innovators</text><text start="268.44" dur="3.39">will play or fail
to play at a very</text><text start="271.83" dur="4.05">crucial moment in the whole
evolutionary trajectory</text><text start="275.88" dur="3.0">of this human experiment.</text><text start="278.88" dur="3.57">Now, this is a little bit
of a different kind of talk</text><text start="282.45" dur="2.16">than you&apos;ve probably
heard before.</text><text start="284.61" dur="3.42">You might think of it
as a meta synthesis.</text><text start="288.03" dur="6.24">A synthesis might bring together
a lot of data and insights</text><text start="294.27" dur="3.18">and factoids of a
variety of kinds</text><text start="297.45" dur="3.48">to deliver a shift of view.</text><text start="300.93" dur="3.0">That&apos;s what a synthesis is.</text><text start="303.93" dur="2.28">But if you really want
to comprehend what&apos;s</text><text start="306.21" dur="2.85">going on right now, it
requires a whole series</text><text start="309.06" dur="1.687">of such syntheses.</text><text start="310.747" dur="1.583">And so what I&apos;m going
to be delivering</text><text start="312.33" dur="3.63">is a meta synthesis
that therefore will not</text><text start="315.96" dur="3.84">be peppered with all
kinds of references</text><text start="319.8" dur="5.08">to particular studies or to
facts you haven&apos;t heard before.</text><text start="324.88" dur="6.5">It&apos;s going to really have to
do with an invitation for you</text><text start="331.38" dur="4.8">to make your way of seeing
an object of your attention</text><text start="336.18" dur="3.69">to make your way of being an
object of your inspection,</text><text start="339.87" dur="4.05">and to draw you
much more profoundly</text><text start="343.92" dur="4.42">into an opportunity
for new possibility.</text><text start="348.34" dur="4.05">So I invite you to suspend your
usual way of listening in order</text><text start="352.39" dur="2.73">to be available to
making real use,</text><text start="355.12" dur="3.09">downloading this meta synthesis
that I&apos;ll be offering.</text><text start="360.95" dur="2.85">Another thing that is
important to set out,</text><text start="363.8" dur="1.98">just as a vocabulary
for us to use</text><text start="365.78" dur="3.44">is the idea of
world views, which</text><text start="369.22" dur="5.19">we&apos;ve all heard of, that people
occupy certain world views.</text><text start="374.41" dur="2.94">And we generally talk
about the differing world</text><text start="377.35" dur="4.02">views, for instance, of
Republicans and Democrats</text><text start="381.37" dur="3.72">in the United
States, or we might</text><text start="385.09" dur="4.14">talk about the world views of
people in an African country,</text><text start="389.23" dur="6.66">or diverse, indigenous
world views, et cetera.</text><text start="395.89" dur="2.56">But it&apos;s important
to understand just</text><text start="398.45" dur="2.43">how profound and far
reaching that idea</text><text start="400.88" dur="5.01">is, that in a sense, when we
occupy a certain way of seeing</text><text start="405.89" dur="4.05">reality, all kinds of
implicit assumptions</text><text start="409.94" dur="3.33">are part and parcel
of our world view,</text><text start="413.27" dur="5.55">and just that we can
recognize world views and even</text><text start="418.82" dur="1.95">observe some things
about our own world view</text><text start="420.77" dur="4.14">doesn&apos;t deliver us from the
limiting function of world</text><text start="424.91" dur="1.01">views.</text><text start="425.92" dur="1.85">A world view is a
total perspective.</text><text start="427.77" dur="2.21">It has implicit in it values.</text><text start="429.98" dur="2.85">It has implicit in it attitudes.</text><text start="432.83" dur="3.63">It has implicit in it ways
of relating to other people.</text><text start="436.46" dur="3.03">And most of that tends to
be invisible to the occupant</text><text start="439.49" dur="1.63">of any world view.</text><text start="441.12" dur="4.34">And so as we begin to talk
here about how our crisis is</text><text start="445.46" dur="5.08">operating, we have to look at
how the conflict of world views</text><text start="450.54" dur="1.07">plays.</text><text start="451.61" dur="4.53">And I&apos;ll go into this a
bit more as we apply it.</text><text start="461.42" dur="2.05">Where are we right now?</text><text start="463.47" dur="5.84">Well, I think that among
democratic voters, recently,</text><text start="469.31" dur="6.83">a poll identified climate
change, which is really</text><text start="476.14" dur="2.94">the proxy for all
ecological issues,</text><text start="479.08" dur="3.78">as I think, the fifth most
urgent issue in the minds</text><text start="482.86" dur="2.93">of democratic voters.</text><text start="485.79" dur="2.91">But in the last year, if
you&apos;ve been paying attention,</text><text start="488.7" dur="4.87">you&apos;ve probably seen
a new IPCC report</text><text start="493.57" dur="5.86">that outlines just
how devastating 1.5</text><text start="499.43" dur="4.25">centigrade rays of global
temperatures would be.</text><text start="503.68" dur="3.66">You&apos;ve also seen a
US climate report</text><text start="507.34" dur="2.73">that underlines those findings.</text><text start="510.07" dur="1.77">You&apos;ve maybe seen
the new findings</text><text start="511.84" dur="5.459">that show that ocean warming
has been taking place way more</text><text start="517.299" dur="3.151">rapidly than anyone
had previously</text><text start="520.45" dur="5.51">been projecting, by somewhere
between 40% and 60%.</text><text start="525.96" dur="3.69">You may have--
well, I won&apos;t keep--</text><text start="529.65" dur="0.93">this is a litany.</text><text start="530.58" dur="1.21">We hear it all the time.</text><text start="531.79" dur="3.77">You don&apos;t really need
that education from me.</text><text start="535.56" dur="3.0">What you are aware of is
that we&apos;re not addressing it,</text><text start="538.56" dur="4.59">and that the struggle to begin
to address it effectively</text><text start="543.15" dur="3.09">is, if you&apos;ve paid attention,
even to European politics,</text><text start="546.24" dur="1.89">where the countries
there are really</text><text start="548.13" dur="2.97">our leaders in the
world, it&apos;s not</text><text start="551.1" dur="2.82">as if the level of
awareness and action</text><text start="553.92" dur="2.01">that the European
countries are taking</text><text start="555.93" dur="1.86">is adequate to the
problem at all.</text><text start="557.79" dur="3.31">And here in the United
States, nothing is happening.</text><text start="561.1" dur="2.63">So the crisis, even
if we think about it</text><text start="563.73" dur="5.07">in climate or ecological
terms, and the meta-crisis</text><text start="568.8" dur="4.5">is much more than that, still
hinges on cultural changes</text><text start="573.3" dur="2.94">and cultural communication.</text><text start="576.24" dur="4.05">And all kinds of
factors are interacting.</text><text start="580.29" dur="2.7">You get serious about
climate, pretty soon,</text><text start="582.99" dur="2.97">you&apos;re really interested
in campaign finance reform.</text><text start="585.96" dur="1.8">Then you&apos;re interested
in reforming</text><text start="587.76" dur="2.25">the Balkanization of media.</text><text start="590.01" dur="2.13">Then you&apos;re interested
in voting rights.</text><text start="592.14" dur="4.11">I mean, you bounce around from
issue to issue as an activist,</text><text start="596.25" dur="2.52">because everything is entangled.</text><text start="598.77" dur="3.61">We have an entangled
series of crises.</text><text start="602.38" dur="2.49">If you&apos;ve looked
closely at what&apos;s</text><text start="604.87" dur="2.65">happening in the
educational system,</text><text start="607.52" dur="2.96">not just in the United
States, but around the world,</text><text start="610.48" dur="4.17">you discover, wow, our whole
way of educating ourselves</text><text start="614.65" dur="3.039">and younger people
is in a crisis.</text><text start="617.689" dur="1.791">The health care system
in the United States</text><text start="619.48" dur="2.92">is particularly in crisis.</text><text start="622.4" dur="7.35">We also can see that there are
crises that are psychological,</text><text start="629.75" dur="7.09">addiction, depression,
anxiety, breakdown of family,</text><text start="636.84" dur="3.69">and the interaction of family
breakdown and neighborhood,</text><text start="640.53" dur="2.07">community breakdown.</text><text start="642.6" dur="4.35">We can talk about this
crisis from multiple angles.</text><text start="646.95" dur="2.4">But really, there&apos;s
only one world.</text><text start="649.35" dur="3.15">And no matter what lens we put
on, no matter what analytics we</text><text start="652.5" dur="3.66">focus our attention on,
we&apos;re catching a partial view</text><text start="656.16" dur="1.86">of a larger phenomenon.</text><text start="658.02" dur="2.82">And it&apos;s a single phenomenon.</text><text start="660.84" dur="2.91">We may be thinking of it
as an ecological crisis.</text><text start="663.75" dur="2.76">We may be thinking of it as
a psychological or spiritual</text><text start="666.51" dur="1.14">crisis.</text><text start="667.65" dur="3.66">We may be thinking of
it as a cultural crisis</text><text start="671.31" dur="3.49">and a breakdown of
community, family, et cetera.</text><text start="674.8" dur="4.84">We may be thinking of it
as a crisis of government</text><text start="679.64" dur="2.58">and economics and finance.</text><text start="682.22" dur="1.99">And it is all of these things.</text><text start="684.21" dur="2.4">But it&apos;s not reducible
to any one of them.</text><text start="686.61" dur="3.08">That&apos;s why it&apos;s a meta-crisis.</text><text start="689.69" dur="5.49">And in a way, crisis isn&apos;t
quite the right word.</text><text start="695.18" dur="1.62">It&apos;s really kind
of a predicament.</text><text start="699.38" dur="6.99">The ecological analysis
that is simplest and easiest</text><text start="706.37" dur="2.61">to communicate,
argues, essentially,</text><text start="708.98" dur="4.33">that we have gone for
some years into overshoot.</text><text start="713.31" dur="3.75">I think it&apos;s summarized
the best by a book called</text><text start="717.06" dur="4.32">&quot;Overshoot&quot; by William Catton
that was published 30 years ago</text><text start="721.38" dur="1.41">almost.</text><text start="722.79" dur="2.67">And it basically
identifies a way</text><text start="725.46" dur="2.79">of understanding any
ecosystem, whether you&apos;re</text><text start="728.25" dur="2.07">talking about an
island or a pond</text><text start="730.32" dur="3.27">or a Petri dish or a planet.</text><text start="733.59" dur="2.88">And whatever ecosystem
you&apos;re describing,</text><text start="736.47" dur="4.95">whatever environment, it has
a certain carrying capacity.</text><text start="741.42" dur="4.11">And its carrying
capacity is the quantity</text><text start="745.53" dur="5.1">of any particular animal or
plant, any life form that</text><text start="750.63" dur="4.23">can be sustainably supported
in that ecosystem over time,</text><text start="754.86" dur="2.07">permanently.</text><text start="756.93" dur="8.86">And when you exceed the carrying
capacity of that ecosystem,</text><text start="765.79" dur="3.99">you might successfully
continue for a while</text><text start="769.78" dur="5.55">by drawing down certain
resources temporarily.</text><text start="775.33" dur="3.834">The problem is that those
resources you draw down then</text><text start="779.164" dur="1.416">are in shorter
supply, and you may</text><text start="780.58" dur="1.74">have reduced the
ultimate carrying</text><text start="782.32" dur="2.1">capacity of that ecosystem.</text><text start="784.42" dur="2.46">You&apos;ve drawn down
non-renewable resources,</text><text start="786.88" dur="3.36">or you&apos;ve damaged the systems
through which resources</text><text start="790.24" dur="3.13">can regenerate.</text><text start="793.37" dur="2.31">And Catton&apos;s
historical analysis is</text><text start="795.68" dur="7.97">that in an accident of
historical sequence,</text><text start="803.65" dur="4.44">around 1,500 Europeans
discovered the New World,</text><text start="808.09" dur="7.74">and very quickly were able to
draw huge amounts of resources</text><text start="815.83" dur="1.6">from the New World.</text><text start="817.43" dur="4.85">So the European
Western countries</text><text start="822.28" dur="3.87">went through a period of
rapid economic expansion,</text><text start="826.15" dur="3.3">based on the availability of
unlimited resources, which</text><text start="829.45" dur="3.66">he calls the corner
cornucopian myth.</text><text start="833.11" dur="5.34">The idea is that there
are now and will always</text><text start="838.45" dur="2.58">be unlimited resources.</text><text start="841.03" dur="2.64">And that was proven
out, because very soon</text><text start="843.67" dur="2.79">after the discovery
of the New World,</text><text start="846.46" dur="4.02">and the full exploitation of
the incredible rise of wealth</text><text start="850.48" dur="2.707">that that brought, there
was the discovery of coal</text><text start="853.187" dur="1.583">and then the discovery
of oil and then</text><text start="854.77" dur="2.97">the discovery of natural gas
and the exploitation of all</text><text start="857.74" dur="1.9">the fossil fuels.</text><text start="859.64" dur="5.93">So we have gone through a
process in now world culture,</text><text start="865.57" dur="4.26">because those European countries
that originally discovered</text><text start="869.83" dur="3.15">the world view,
it is their legacy</text><text start="872.98" dur="4.03">that is now the pattern
of the whole modern world.</text><text start="877.01" dur="2.57">No matter what part of
the world you go to,</text><text start="879.58" dur="3.72">the systems that
are dominant are</text><text start="883.3" dur="4.08">the legacy of that original--</text><text start="887.38" dur="2.722">the conquest of the world
by the white man&apos;s tribes,</text><text start="890.102" dur="0.708">we might call it.</text><text start="893.61" dur="7.99">So that world has now
instantiated a presumption</text><text start="901.6" dur="8.05">of unlimited resources and
never ending economic expansion,</text><text start="909.65" dur="3.15">and we&apos;re now in the
neighborhood of a peak oil</text><text start="912.8" dur="4.77">moment, in which the efficiency
with which we can make use</text><text start="917.57" dur="3.72">of the remaining fossil
fuels is degrading,</text><text start="921.29" dur="2.55">and that&apos;s periodically
sending shocks.</text><text start="923.84" dur="3.63">It&apos;s one of the reasons that our
financial markets are so jumpy,</text><text start="927.47" dur="2.82">why there is so much pessimism,
why so many people say</text><text start="930.29" dur="2.1">that things are on
the wrong track,</text><text start="932.39" dur="4.05">et cetera, et cetera. this sense
of disquiet, this sense that we</text><text start="936.44" dur="6.15">are headed for some kind
of apocalyptic calamity</text><text start="942.59" dur="2.46">is sort of in the water system.</text><text start="945.05" dur="1.98">You go to the multiplex.</text><text start="947.03" dur="5.26">Three out of four movies
are about saving the world.</text><text start="952.29" dur="3.62">Well, we wouldn&apos;t be saving
the world if it weren&apos;t that we</text><text start="955.91" dur="2.85">believed in some way that
something about what we rest in</text><text start="958.76" dur="1.75">is endangered.</text><text start="960.51" dur="4.04">So there&apos;s a deep
malaise and a confusion</text><text start="964.55" dur="3.93">that is culturally
pervasive that partly comes</text><text start="968.48" dur="3.12">from this intuition
of this situation</text><text start="971.6" dur="5.75">that the cornucopian era
is now under challenge.</text><text start="977.35" dur="3.09">I personally believe
that we will discover</text><text start="980.44" dur="5.22">a relatively free,
relatively clean energy</text><text start="985.66" dur="2.01">source at some
point, and that there</text><text start="987.67" dur="4.62">will be another round of
cornucopian possibility.</text><text start="992.29" dur="4.32">But the unsustainability
of a long term cornucopian</text><text start="996.61" dur="3.6">orientation needs to be--</text><text start="1000.21" dur="3.66">well, the sustainability
of it needs to be examined.</text><text start="1003.87" dur="3.45">The presumption that we
can simply take for granted</text><text start="1007.32" dur="4.41">that this orientation will
be a permanent condition</text><text start="1011.73" dur="4.67">of our existence deserves
critical inspection.</text><text start="1016.4" dur="4.24">Let me digress for a moment
and introduce a vocabulary.</text><text start="1020.64" dur="2.12">I called you guys
innovators, and I</text><text start="1022.76" dur="4.71">was drawing on a very
simple categorization</text><text start="1027.47" dur="3.66">that I make of what I
consider the three most</text><text start="1031.13" dur="1.89">important conversations
that human beings are</text><text start="1033.02" dur="2.16">having at this time.</text><text start="1035.18" dur="3.929">We are at a time in which we are
reaching an inflection point,</text><text start="1039.109" dur="3.631">and we are beginning to have
serious conversations in which</text><text start="1042.74" dur="5.22">our very best intelligence
is in dialogue with itself</text><text start="1047.96" dur="4.04">in the form of the most
intelligent participants.</text><text start="1052.0" dur="3.57">But we&apos;re having three different
conversations that I think,</text><text start="1055.57" dur="2.52">each of which I
believe are essential.</text><text start="1058.09" dur="3.52">And those conversations are not
in dialogue with one another.</text><text start="1061.61" dur="2.06">So one of them I
call the innovators.</text><text start="1063.67" dur="3.09">And I very frequently
mentioned Larry Page as one</text><text start="1066.76" dur="4.29">of the leading thinkers of
that innovator conversation,</text><text start="1071.05" dur="2.43">along with many, many,
many others, too many</text><text start="1073.48" dur="1.35">to mention adequately.</text><text start="1074.83" dur="3.33">But I&apos;ll throw out a few
names, but the obvious people,</text><text start="1078.16" dur="4.11">Elon Musk, Bill Gates.</text><text start="1082.27" dur="4.8">But Sam Harris-- you know,
they&apos;re not all entrepreneurs,</text><text start="1087.07" dur="0.78">necessarily.</text><text start="1087.85" dur="2.97">Rational-- Steven
Pinker, a variety</text><text start="1090.82" dur="6.03">of innovators who are in
the most powerful position</text><text start="1096.85" dur="2.4">right now and are seen
broadly in our culture</text><text start="1099.25" dur="2.43">as the people who are
creating the future.</text><text start="1101.68" dur="2.91">Because not only are they
capturing the flag in terms</text><text start="1104.59" dur="2.232">of technological and
scientific advances,</text><text start="1106.822" dur="1.458">they&apos;re capturing
the flag in terms</text><text start="1108.28" dur="4.14">of the entrepreneurial
deployment of those advances,</text><text start="1112.42" dur="2.58">and therefore, they have
the cultural influence</text><text start="1115.0" dur="3.21">and the money to really
back up their intention</text><text start="1118.21" dur="5.81">to be the change, map the
future of possibility.</text><text start="1124.02" dur="3.9">But I kind of briefly
alluded to this point of view</text><text start="1127.92" dur="3.81">that I describe and give
the simple name ecologists.</text><text start="1131.73" dur="2.53">And I would say the
ecologists ascribe</text><text start="1134.26" dur="6.68">to the narrative I offered,
that the cornucopian myth is</text><text start="1140.94" dur="3.21">a myth, that the
Malthusian attitude,</text><text start="1144.15" dur="4.05">which is that we are
headed for a collision--</text><text start="1148.2" dur="2.01">you know, the
Malthusians have been</text><text start="1150.21" dur="2.4">proven wrong again and
again and again and again</text><text start="1152.61" dur="0.81">throughout history.</text><text start="1153.42" dur="1.83">So the evidence
kind of stacks up</text><text start="1155.25" dur="3.12">to support a
cornucopian orientation,</text><text start="1158.37" dur="3.66">except we&apos;re dealing
with a collision</text><text start="1162.03" dur="2.62">of a different character
than we ever have before.</text><text start="1164.65" dur="1.82">And we don&apos;t see solutions.</text><text start="1166.47" dur="2.05">I&apos;ll get into that in a minute.</text><text start="1168.52" dur="3.14">So I think that
ecologists, you know,</text><text start="1171.66" dur="3.054">there&apos;s a great range of
people I would call ecologists</text><text start="1174.714" dur="1.416">I would include
my friend, Michael</text><text start="1176.13" dur="4.75">Dowd, the evolutionary
evangelist, who&apos;s</text><text start="1180.88" dur="3.02">a very rational character.</text><text start="1183.9" dur="2.65">But I would also include--</text><text start="1186.55" dur="2.33">for instance, there&apos;s a
non-profit organization</text><text start="1188.88" dur="3.93">here in San Francisco called
the Pachamama Alliance, where</text><text start="1192.81" dur="3.57">a financier, Bill Twist
and his wife Lynne,</text><text start="1196.38" dur="4.65">who was the kind of
leader of the Hunger</text><text start="1201.03" dur="4.86">Project for many years, had
a visit to Achuar people</text><text start="1205.89" dur="4.2">in the Amazon and
Ecuador and formed</text><text start="1210.09" dur="1.95">an alliance with
indigenous people,</text><text start="1212.04" dur="6.28">and they&apos;re bringing services
into that part of the world</text><text start="1218.32" dur="2.91">and trying to preserve
chunks of the forest,</text><text start="1221.23" dur="1.8">the habitat of those people.</text><text start="1223.03" dur="4.23">But what they&apos;re arguing
for, more fundamentally,</text><text start="1227.26" dur="3.35">is that there is a kind of--</text><text start="1230.61" dur="4.17">we have lost our memory of how
to live on this planet in a way</text><text start="1234.78" dur="3.69">that doesn&apos;t destroy it,
and that there is something</text><text start="1238.47" dur="4.68">fundamental in the existential
orientation of a life that</text><text start="1243.15" dur="4.29">knows at a deep unconscious
or pre-conscious level</text><text start="1247.44" dur="5.97">that it is killing its host,
that all of us are sick,</text><text start="1253.41" dur="4.11">it would be argued, because
how we feed ourselves,</text><text start="1257.52" dur="2.58">how we transport ourselves,
how we earn our living,</text><text start="1260.1" dur="3.93">and everything else are
intertwined inexorably</text><text start="1264.03" dur="3.72">with a larger system that
is completely unsustainable.</text><text start="1267.75" dur="3.93">And it&apos;s producing horrific
effects that offend us,</text><text start="1271.68" dur="2.91">morally and spiritually.</text><text start="1274.59" dur="4.47">And the ecologists are
arguing in a variety</text><text start="1279.06" dur="1.5">of ways-- some of
them simply have</text><text start="1280.56" dur="2.52">to do with a rational
argument about how</text><text start="1283.08" dur="1.12">to preserve our future.</text><text start="1284.2" dur="4.55">Others have to do with the
whole field of eco psychology</text><text start="1288.75" dur="4.9">as one of the expressions of
this ecological point of view.</text><text start="1293.65" dur="5.522">And there are very intelligent,
very well-read, very deeply--</text><text start="1299.172" dur="1.458">I&apos;m going to be
offering you a link</text><text start="1300.63" dur="3.63">to a rather terrifying,
but very well researched</text><text start="1304.26" dur="4.89">paper called &quot;Deep Adaptation&quot;
by an academic ecologist,</text><text start="1309.15" dur="4.86">somebody in the field
of sustainability.</text><text start="1314.01" dur="2.43">It&apos;s kind of business
management for sustainability</text><text start="1316.44" dur="3.36">is now a pretty big field, and
he&apos;s a leading expert there.</text><text start="1319.8" dur="7.746">And he&apos;s arguing for this
scenario of societal collapse.</text><text start="1327.546" dur="1.374">Now, there&apos;s a
third group that I</text><text start="1328.92" dur="3.12">think is equally important
that I call the evolutionaries.</text><text start="1332.04" dur="4.08">And I would number myself
as an evolutionary.</text><text start="1336.12" dur="2.94">What characterizes
evolutionaries is,</text><text start="1339.06" dur="7.4">is that we recognize evolution
as a multidimensional affair.</text><text start="1346.46" dur="2.44">It wasn&apos;t just
biological evolution,</text><text start="1348.9" dur="1.73">which is what people
usually think of,</text><text start="1350.63" dur="4.57">the adaptive emergence
of new traits.</text><text start="1358.73" dur="3.35">There was cosmic evolution
before the earth was formed</text><text start="1362.08" dur="2.74">and in the early years of the
earth, that just took place</text><text start="1364.82" dur="1.5">in the [INAUDIBLE]
sphere, before it</text><text start="1366.32" dur="4.08">moved into the biosphere
and created the biosphere.</text><text start="1370.4" dur="2.13">And really, the most
important evolution</text><text start="1372.53" dur="2.01">that&apos;s been going on
for the last 500 years</text><text start="1374.54" dur="2.76">has been cultural
evolution, the evolution</text><text start="1377.3" dur="2.71">in the noetic sphere,
the interiors,</text><text start="1380.01" dur="2.12">the collective learning
of human beings.</text><text start="1382.13" dur="3.84">And it&apos;s here that we
have our biggest problem,</text><text start="1385.97" dur="3.09">because no matter how
much we might locate</text><text start="1389.06" dur="2.34">our crisis as a
matter of maintaining</text><text start="1391.4" dur="3.39">a habitable earth, our ability
to reach agreements and make</text><text start="1394.79" dur="2.22">intelligent,
collective decisions is</text><text start="1397.01" dur="3.69">crucial to any solution we
might want to instantiate.</text><text start="1400.7" dur="1.98">And we can all see how broken--</text><text start="1402.68" dur="2.34">we say our politics
are broken, but it&apos;s</text><text start="1405.02" dur="2.95">a much more pervasive matter.</text><text start="1407.97" dur="6.91">So evolutionaries are those
who take a meta perspective</text><text start="1414.88" dur="4.62">on the perspectives
in play and recognize</text><text start="1419.5" dur="6.37">that we are only
effective if we can</text><text start="1425.87" dur="3.75">put on the lens of the person
we&apos;re in discourse with,</text><text start="1429.62" dur="5.76">and if we can draw ourselves
beyond the limits of the world</text><text start="1435.38" dur="4.05">view we&apos;re inhabiting, and
that to do that, we need</text><text start="1439.43" dur="1.95">a lot of things that
radically reformat</text><text start="1441.38" dur="6.0">the hard drive, for example,
higher states of consciousness.</text><text start="1447.38" dur="3.42">Particularly, there
are different species</text><text start="1450.8" dur="5.0">of those higher states that we
can visit through entheogens</text><text start="1455.8" dur="2.88">or psychedelics, or that
we can intentionally</text><text start="1458.68" dur="3.0">cultivate through
practice of meditation,</text><text start="1461.68" dur="2.53">a variety of approaches.</text><text start="1464.21" dur="3.45">That&apos;s only one part of what
evolutionaries bring in.</text><text start="1467.66" dur="2.69">Part of what evolutionaries
are able to see</text><text start="1470.35" dur="4.63">is the way that world views
define everything we can see.</text><text start="1474.98" dur="6.38">So evolutionaries are
looking at this whole matter</text><text start="1481.36" dur="2.61">in an evolutionary context
and are recognizing</text><text start="1483.97" dur="3.11">its evolutionary implications.</text><text start="1487.08" dur="2.44">And there&apos;s a lot more
to say about that,</text><text start="1489.52" dur="5.03">but very briefly, we
are alive at a time when</text><text start="1494.55" dur="5.56">from an evolutionary
perspective of life on Earth,</text><text start="1500.11" dur="5.3">of not just the human species,
but most even marginally</text><text start="1505.41" dur="5.56">intelligent species, not all,
but most mammalian species,</text><text start="1510.97" dur="3.14">there&apos;s an existential
crisis brewing right now.</text><text start="1514.11" dur="5.74">What happens in your lifetimes
will have profound implications</text><text start="1519.85" dur="3.85">to the future, not
just of human life,</text><text start="1523.7" dur="5.03">but of every charismatic
megafauna species</text><text start="1528.73" dur="2.79">that you might care about.</text><text start="1531.52" dur="1.11">And we are here.</text><text start="1532.63" dur="4.27">Who is going to be a part of
the creation of that future?</text><text start="1536.9" dur="4.04">And who has an opportunity
to make a moral difference?</text><text start="1540.94" dur="2.56">We are the ones.</text><text start="1543.5" dur="5.19">When we take that seriously,
it tends to sober us a lot.</text><text start="1548.69" dur="4.74">This particular moment in
time, I think maybe some of you</text><text start="1553.43" dur="4.68">have noticed the 11
year time frame that</text><text start="1558.11" dur="4.62">was identified in
the most recent IPCC</text><text start="1562.73" dur="3.87">report about 1.5 degrees
centigrade temperature</text><text start="1566.6" dur="1.14">increase.</text><text start="1567.74" dur="3.78">We have to make radical
changes that transform</text><text start="1571.52" dur="4.8">our whole pattern of
our whole economy,</text><text start="1576.32" dur="3.87">relative to what powers
us, fossil fuels,</text><text start="1580.19" dur="4.32">and accomplish it in
something like 11 years,</text><text start="1584.51" dur="3.15">according to that
particular analysis.</text><text start="1587.66" dur="4.95">Now, is that analysis
absolutely dependable?</text><text start="1592.61" dur="5.51">Every analysis and every
perspective, by the way,</text><text start="1598.12" dur="2.66">is both true and partial.</text><text start="1600.78" dur="5.25">I think what we can know and how
well we can know it needs to be</text><text start="1606.03" dur="6.18">viewed with a kind of
self-critical awareness,</text><text start="1612.21" dur="4.01">that that 11 year--</text><text start="1616.22" dur="2.46">at the end, nobody
knows for sure.</text><text start="1618.68" dur="4.98">But really, well-informed,
intelligent, deep people</text><text start="1623.66" dur="3.24">have done their best to quantify
our window of opportunity.</text><text start="1626.9" dur="1.57">And they&apos;ve come
up with 11 years.</text><text start="1628.47" dur="1.76">That&apos;s enough for me.</text><text start="1630.23" dur="2.22">What I have decided,
and what I offer</text><text start="1632.45" dur="2.65">to you is the idea
that as much as you</text><text start="1635.1" dur="2.0">may look at things through
a certain world view,</text><text start="1637.1" dur="4.41">and as much as that may
be inescapable, that is,</text><text start="1641.51" dur="3.13">you can&apos;t just notice that
there are multiple world views</text><text start="1644.64" dur="2.48">and escape the
limits of your own.</text><text start="1647.12" dur="4.53">You are bound to it, but
you can be in conversation</text><text start="1651.65" dur="3.57">with perspectives
that are only apparent</text><text start="1655.22" dur="4.17">from outside your world view.</text><text start="1659.39" dur="4.22">It is a little like state
specific memory, you know--</text><text start="1663.61" dur="2.045">I remember, as a
kid seeing kind of--</text><text start="1665.655" dur="1.625">I don&apos;t think it was
a Hitchcock movie,</text><text start="1667.28" dur="1.5">but sort of a similar
to a Hitchcock</text><text start="1668.78" dur="2.28">movie, about a
guy who could only</text><text start="1671.06" dur="5.04">remember certain things when
he was drunk or sometimes</text><text start="1676.1" dur="1.62">in a rage, or whatever.</text><text start="1677.72" dur="4.92">Only in a certain state are
certain things perceptible.</text><text start="1682.64" dur="6.27">Well, we can think about some of
what we&apos;re dealing with, using</text><text start="1688.91" dur="3.21">that as a useful metaphor.</text><text start="1692.12" dur="2.79">It illuminates the fact
that we are actually</text><text start="1694.91" dur="3.06">occupying entirely
different realities,</text><text start="1697.97" dur="1.41">and yet, we talk
with one another</text><text start="1699.38" dur="2.43">in a single body
of discourse, as</text><text start="1701.81" dur="2.85">if there were a single
knowable truth that we all</text><text start="1704.66" dur="2.81">ought to be able to
talk one another into.</text><text start="1707.47" dur="3.07">Well, this orientation that
we have a definable problem</text><text start="1710.54" dur="6.06">that we can figure out, and that
has a single definable solution</text><text start="1716.6" dur="5.19">is completely obsolete.</text><text start="1721.79" dur="3.68">We are facing in
this meta-crisis</text><text start="1725.47" dur="4.45">a necessity of transformation
on every level of human life.</text><text start="1729.92" dur="4.68">It&apos;s what I refer to in my
book as whole systems change.</text><text start="1734.6" dur="3.69">That means that there are
psychological changes, what</text><text start="1738.29" dur="4.92">our idea is of a successful life
well-lived, what our ideas are</text><text start="1743.21" dur="5.0">about satisfying relationships,
what we aspire to,</text><text start="1748.21" dur="4.2">what gives our life meaning
and purpose, the ways that we</text><text start="1752.41" dur="1.73">enjoy.</text><text start="1754.14" dur="3.01">All that&apos;s going to have
to go through a morph.</text><text start="1757.15" dur="2.3">It does arrive on
a personal level.</text><text start="1759.45" dur="4.14">Maybe we begin by thinking of
this as an engineering problem,</text><text start="1763.59" dur="3.36">of coming up with a relatively
free and cheap energy</text><text start="1766.95" dur="3.78">source that will liberate
us from this problem,</text><text start="1770.73" dur="3.03">but that wouldn&apos;t suffice.</text><text start="1773.76" dur="2.55">In fact, there are
analyses of what</text><text start="1776.31" dur="2.76">we&apos;re facing that
don&apos;t focus even</text><text start="1779.07" dur="3.54">on ecology, that regard the
whole matter as a matter</text><text start="1782.61" dur="4.41">of a self-accelerating pattern.</text><text start="1787.02" dur="3.03">Maybe some of you are aware
of a very important book that</text><text start="1790.05" dur="4.41">was published in 2017 by the
physicist Geoffrey West, who</text><text start="1794.46" dur="3.45">is the director of the
Santa Fe Institute.</text><text start="1797.91" dur="1.98">The title of the
book is &quot;Scale,&quot;</text><text start="1799.89" dur="3.21">and in it, he used the tools
of physics, mainly math</text><text start="1803.1" dur="4.95">and ratios, to analyze
biological and social systems.</text><text start="1808.05" dur="2.64">And he came up with a lot
of very interesting insights</text><text start="1810.69" dur="4.77">about metabolism and lifespan
and cities and so forth.</text><text start="1815.46" dur="2.85">But to me, the most
interesting single piece</text><text start="1818.31" dur="2.73">of that broad analysis
was his tracking</text><text start="1821.04" dur="4.11">historically of the
major transformations</text><text start="1825.15" dur="2.52">of the techno economic
means of production</text><text start="1827.67" dur="4.47">that power human societies, like
the discovery and use of stone</text><text start="1832.14" dur="4.393">tools, or agriculture.</text><text start="1836.533" dur="3.587">He marked each one that
had an advent of out</text><text start="1840.12" dur="2.91">of a major increase,
because it definitely</text><text start="1843.03" dur="3.36">precedes in the stage process.</text><text start="1846.39" dur="4.44">It isn&apos;t a smooth
ramped trajectory.</text><text start="1850.83" dur="5.16">And what he noticed was
that each transformation</text><text start="1855.99" dur="3.12">happened faster and faster
and faster and faster.</text><text start="1859.11" dur="4.8">And he noted, gosh, if we
are all together involved</text><text start="1863.91" dur="5.68">in a self-accelerating pattern,
we have a design problem,</text><text start="1869.59" dur="4.62">because a self-accelerating
pattern is self-terminating.</text><text start="1874.21" dur="2.82">You can&apos;t go faster
and faster forever.</text><text start="1877.03" dur="3.15">If you track changes
on a timeline,</text><text start="1880.18" dur="2.7">and at first, they&apos;re
very slow, and then</text><text start="1882.88" dur="2.37">they&apos;re a little faster and
faster and faster and faster</text><text start="1885.25" dur="4.2">and faster and faster, you
come upon a time singularity.</text><text start="1889.45" dur="5.4">And he identified as a
result of that analysis</text><text start="1894.85" dur="3.18">that a grand unified
theory of sustainability</text><text start="1898.03" dur="4.2">was the way he put it that
combined our understandings</text><text start="1902.23" dur="5.96">of economics and politics
and social theory and all</text><text start="1908.19" dur="3.93">the hard sciences
would be necessary</text><text start="1912.12" dur="1.32">in order to turn that around.</text><text start="1913.44" dur="4.02">He imagined that one of
these stage transitions</text><text start="1917.46" dur="2.25">might give us the
breathing space</text><text start="1919.71" dur="2.52">to make that kind
of a radical turn</text><text start="1922.23" dur="3.48">toward a permanently sustainable
presence on the planet.</text><text start="1925.71" dur="3.33">But it was really something
he conceived of abstractly</text><text start="1929.04" dur="2.97">as a hypothetical.</text><text start="1932.01" dur="3.24">Another futurist, Peter Russell,
came to the same conclusions,</text><text start="1935.25" dur="3.55">examining entirely
different data.</text><text start="1938.8" dur="2.99">But in a way, it&apos;s an
extension of the thesis</text><text start="1941.79" dur="3.21">that Alvin Toffler put
forward almost 30 years ago</text><text start="1945.0" dur="1.77">in &quot;Future Shock.&quot;</text><text start="1946.77" dur="4.56">And part of our meta-crisis is
simply the human adaptation.</text><text start="1951.33" dur="4.41">We talk a lot about how much our
lives have changed because we</text><text start="1955.74" dur="3.93">live so much of it online, and
our relationships are mediated,</text><text start="1959.67" dur="3.0">and that&apos;s affecting us
in both good and bad ways,</text><text start="1962.67" dur="6.1">and it&apos;s very different
now to be 10 or 15 or 20.</text><text start="1968.77" dur="2.6">Everybody is going through a
transformation because of that,</text><text start="1971.37" dur="2.31">and that&apos;s a piece
of our meta-crisis.</text><text start="1973.68" dur="4.29">The argument there is
that change is stressful,</text><text start="1977.97" dur="2.55">and complexification
is stressful,</text><text start="1980.52" dur="3.66">and this self-accelerated
crisis is speeding up</text><text start="1984.18" dur="3.45">change and complexification
to a point that it&apos;s</text><text start="1987.63" dur="3.87">beginning to test the
neurological limits</text><text start="1991.5" dur="2.76">of human adaptation.</text><text start="1994.26" dur="2.31">So that may be true.</text><text start="1996.57" dur="2.1">It&apos;s important to
realize, though,</text><text start="1998.67" dur="3.36">that when we look at all of
these critical tipping points,</text><text start="2002.03" dur="4.37">I&apos;ve been mentioning, primarily,
depressing, negative ones.</text><text start="2006.4" dur="4.79">But there are equally inspiring,
potentially positive ones</text><text start="2011.19" dur="2.55">in play, not just
technologically,</text><text start="2013.74" dur="4.23">but you know, for instance,
all the wisdom traditions</text><text start="2017.97" dur="5.05">of every culture on Earth
have been in conversation now</text><text start="2023.02" dur="5.81">in at least a beginning way
for over 50, maybe 75 years.</text><text start="2028.83" dur="2.82">And we now have a couple of
generations of Westerners,</text><text start="2031.65" dur="4.65">who&apos;ve applied themselves to
the technologies of awakening</text><text start="2036.3" dur="2.55">or enlightenment that
come from the East.</text><text start="2038.85" dur="1.5">And those people
are in conversation</text><text start="2040.35" dur="5.1">with each other informed
by the beneficial influence</text><text start="2045.45" dur="3.39">of scientific
analytical tools, I</text><text start="2048.84" dur="2.43">mean, just comparative
religion, for example.</text><text start="2051.27" dur="1.84">But much more
rigorous than that,</text><text start="2053.11" dur="2.33">we&apos;re quantifying
all kinds of things,</text><text start="2055.44" dur="4.11">and our development
of the technology</text><text start="2059.55" dur="4.98">of becoming our best, not
just consciousness hacking,</text><text start="2064.53" dur="3.27">but peak performance
as a general category,</text><text start="2067.8" dur="8.01">is reaching a whole new level
of objective clarification.</text><text start="2075.81" dur="2.52">And we have a lot of
people who are applying</text><text start="2078.33" dur="1.74">those tools, and
who are achieving</text><text start="2080.07" dur="3.18">different levels of
clarity and excellence,</text><text start="2083.25" dur="5.639">who are advancing the
dialogue, just as in AI, we</text><text start="2088.889" dur="3.33">may get to a point where
intelligent machines can</text><text start="2092.219" dur="2.161">redesign even more
intelligent machines.</text><text start="2094.38" dur="3.39">We already have people
who are embodying</text><text start="2097.77" dur="5.12">excellence, who are refining the
field of embodying excellence.</text><text start="2102.89" dur="3.9">And there&apos;s the beginnings
of the virtuous cycle</text><text start="2106.79" dur="2.97">that might bring about
a positive singularity</text><text start="2109.76" dur="1.32">of that kind.</text><text start="2111.08" dur="4.96">And there are other dynamics
that are very important.</text><text start="2116.04" dur="6.0">One of the things that I get
into in my book pretty richly</text><text start="2122.04" dur="3.42">is our disasters are going to
open windows of opportunity</text><text start="2125.46" dur="3.18">for more fundamental
systems redesign,</text><text start="2128.64" dur="2.61">that after it&apos;s too late
will be when it becomes</text><text start="2131.25" dur="3.21">possible to do many things.</text><text start="2134.46" dur="8.37">One of the problems that we
have with the current dialog</text><text start="2142.83" dur="4.27">is that everybody participating
in it, for the most part, very</text><text start="2147.1" dur="2.94">few, few
evolutionaries, are free</text><text start="2150.04" dur="3.9">enough from the implications
not to be so gripped by the fear</text><text start="2153.94" dur="4.56">and grief that come upon
us when we contemplate</text><text start="2158.5" dur="3.057">civilizational collapse, or the
end of the human experiment,</text><text start="2161.557" dur="2.583">that they&apos;re able to have enough
free attention to participate</text><text start="2164.14" dur="2.11">with all their capacities.</text><text start="2166.25" dur="3.11">And so a big subsection
of what I teach</text><text start="2169.36" dur="4.35">and what I bring to
people is an understanding</text><text start="2173.71" dur="5.39">that no matter
what, you are going</text><text start="2179.1" dur="4.53">to, at some point in your
life, experience what</text><text start="2183.63" dur="2.71">the Buddhists call the
heavenly messenger, sickness,</text><text start="2186.34" dur="3.03">old age, and death.</text><text start="2189.37" dur="3.27">You will, and we all
will experience loss.</text><text start="2192.64" dur="2.34">We will all experience pain.</text><text start="2194.98" dur="3.42">And we&apos;ll eventually
cease to exist.</text><text start="2198.4" dur="2.64">And that&apos;s always
been OK with us.</text><text start="2201.04" dur="2.28">So the fact that we&apos;re
facing some of this</text><text start="2203.32" dur="3.57">collectively, that the most
extreme challenges in every one</text><text start="2206.89" dur="2.25">of our individual
lives, are challenges</text><text start="2209.14" dur="2.19">that we face together,
this is stimulating</text><text start="2211.33" dur="3.57">and will stimulate a new
species of conversations.</text><text start="2214.9" dur="3.48">Our intelligence will be
in conversation with itself</text><text start="2218.38" dur="1.45">in new ways.</text><text start="2219.83" dur="3.32">And the people who
can do that best</text><text start="2223.15" dur="4.45">are the innovators, because
you, collectively speaking,</text><text start="2227.6" dur="3.06">are the dominant influence
in culture right now.</text><text start="2230.66" dur="2.06">But because your
world view tends</text><text start="2232.72" dur="3.99">to confine what you think of
as relevant and interesting</text><text start="2236.71" dur="2.91">to the kinds of things
you already recognize,</text><text start="2239.62" dur="2.76">you&apos;re tending not to recognize
the fresh perspectives</text><text start="2242.38" dur="4.44">and important truths that are
also being brought forward</text><text start="2246.82" dur="3.03">by the intelligent
conversations among ecologists</text><text start="2249.85" dur="2.1">or evolutionaries.</text><text start="2251.95" dur="2.97">And so it will be the--</text><text start="2254.92" dur="2.76">not the kind of--</text><text start="2257.68" dur="2.16">what we might call
the yang heroism,</text><text start="2259.84" dur="3.78">the very masculine heroism,
kind of like Hercules,</text><text start="2263.62" dur="2.73">bursting through, of the
innovators saving the day</text><text start="2266.35" dur="2.666">with new breakthroughs
that will be sufficient,</text><text start="2269.016" dur="1.624">because the cultural
dimension is going</text><text start="2270.64" dur="3.57">to require a coming
together of the human family</text><text start="2274.21" dur="2.01">and of all our intelligence.</text><text start="2276.22" dur="4.11">So it is innovators,
who by waking up</text><text start="2280.33" dur="3.48">to a certain fundamental
epistemic humility, recognizing</text><text start="2283.81" dur="3.6">that the way you know and the
way you see, however clearly</text><text start="2287.41" dur="5.05">and with whatever profoundly
penetrating laser vision,</text><text start="2292.46" dur="3.53">you may have, is only
a part of the process</text><text start="2295.99" dur="2.04">and that you need to
be in conversation</text><text start="2298.03" dur="2.28">with other perspectives,
and particularly</text><text start="2300.31" dur="3.15">the families of conversation
that I&apos;m lining out here,</text><text start="2303.46" dur="3.51">that I call ecologists
and evolutionaries.</text><text start="2306.97" dur="5.65">So leadership among
innovators, who take seriously</text><text start="2312.62" dur="3.17">your unique
responsibility, is perhaps</text><text start="2315.79" dur="4.68">one of the crucial things
that can turn the Titanic.</text><text start="2320.47" dur="2.61">Many of you are probably
familiar with the idea</text><text start="2323.08" dur="1.68">of the trim tab.</text><text start="2324.76" dur="4.67">This is something Bucky
Fuller talked about a lot.</text><text start="2329.43" dur="1.68">When you have really--</text><text start="2331.11" dur="5.4">the Queen Mary, a really
large ocean liner, a rudder</text><text start="2336.51" dur="1.89">turns the ship.</text><text start="2338.4" dur="4.32">The turning radius
is way too wide.</text><text start="2342.72" dur="4.17">The efficiency of
navigation is compromised</text><text start="2346.89" dur="1.47">by the very size of the ship.</text><text start="2348.36" dur="3.75">Even with massive rudders,
they turn too slow.</text><text start="2352.11" dur="2.73">But if you put another
little rudder on the end,</text><text start="2354.84" dur="3.09">not very big, with a
very powerful motor</text><text start="2357.93" dur="3.64">and all kinds of bracing,
it turns way faster.</text><text start="2361.57" dur="3.08">That&apos;s a trim tab,
that extra rudder.</text><text start="2364.65" dur="3.21">And if we&apos;re going
to turn this Titanic,</text><text start="2367.86" dur="4.05">it&apos;s going to be because
of little acts of heroism</text><text start="2371.91" dur="3.96">by many, many people
in a broad complex.</text><text start="2375.87" dur="3.42">It will be necessary for
our best intelligence</text><text start="2379.29" dur="4.89">not to just rearrange the
deck chairs in this Titanic</text><text start="2384.18" dur="3.36">metaphor, but to break into the
engine room and grab the wheel</text><text start="2387.54" dur="2.59">and actually turn the ship.</text><text start="2390.13" dur="3.89">And I want you to
consider that this</text><text start="2394.02" dur="5.55">is an inspiring and ennobling
prospect, that it&apos;s thrilling</text><text start="2399.57" dur="1.14">to be alive right now.</text><text start="2404.412" dur="5.048">In some of the-- you might
say the Jungian and soul based</text><text start="2409.46" dur="2.34">psychological and
spiritual traditions,</text><text start="2411.8" dur="4.54">it is said that we consented
to be born in this time.</text><text start="2416.34" dur="1.93">Whether we think of it
in those terms or not,</text><text start="2418.27" dur="1.52">we certainly are
born in this time.</text><text start="2419.79" dur="1.5">This is our time.</text><text start="2421.29" dur="3.57">Whatever your
character is, it is</text><text start="2424.86" dur="4.68">going to be expressed in the
peculiar mix of opportunities</text><text start="2429.54" dur="3.01">and challenges that present
themselves in this time.</text><text start="2432.55" dur="3.65">And so you have
coincided with a moment</text><text start="2436.2" dur="1.98">in which the events
in your lifetime</text><text start="2438.18" dur="2.85">are going to be of
enormous consequence</text><text start="2441.03" dur="2.01">on an evolutionary
scale, and you</text><text start="2443.04" dur="3.93">have some measure of
intelligence and capacity</text><text start="2446.97" dur="3.18">and power.</text><text start="2450.15" dur="8.53">There&apos;s a chilling poem
written by Drew Dellinger,</text><text start="2458.68" dur="4.38">with lines that go something
like, it&apos;s 3:23 in the morning,</text><text start="2463.06" dur="2.58">and I can&apos;t sleep.</text><text start="2465.64" dur="2.58">I keep hearing the voices of
my great great grandchildren</text><text start="2468.22" dur="4.41">calling to me,
asking me, what did</text><text start="2472.63" dur="2.97">you do when the
planet was unraveling?</text><text start="2475.6" dur="6.61">What did you do when
the oceans were dying?</text><text start="2482.21" dur="2.95">Once you knew, what did you do?</text><text start="2485.16" dur="2.97">That&apos;s a tremendous
moral seriousness,</text><text start="2488.13" dur="2.4">and the paradox is
we can&apos;t fulfill it</text><text start="2490.53" dur="5.71">if we let the weight
of that sobriety</text><text start="2496.24" dur="1.5">kill our sense of humor.</text><text start="2497.74" dur="2.88">Things are far too serious for
us to lose our sense of humor.</text><text start="2500.62" dur="2.7">Things are far too serious
for us to lose our capacity</text><text start="2503.32" dur="1.62">for lightheartedness.</text><text start="2504.94" dur="3.57">We are being asked to come
into the game with a yes,</text><text start="2508.51" dur="4.69">we can kind of an attitude, a
can do positive orientation.</text><text start="2513.2" dur="3.62">And when you begin to
recognize where you really are,</text><text start="2516.82" dur="5.07">I think instead of arriving in
this orientation of believing</text><text start="2521.89" dur="2.55">in collapse, which,
in my opinion,</text><text start="2524.44" dur="4.35">is a problem, because
mindset becomes</text><text start="2528.79" dur="1.125">a self-fulfilling prophecy.</text><text start="2532.49" dur="1.95">Things are far
too serious for us</text><text start="2534.44" dur="2.13">to allow that
pessimism to condition</text><text start="2536.57" dur="3.12">our way of participating, such
that the potential heroism</text><text start="2539.69" dur="2.49">that we might bring
to this complex</text><text start="2542.18" dur="4.81">is dented by our depression,
or our discouragement.</text><text start="2546.99" dur="4.22">So a whole different quality
of human relationship</text><text start="2551.21" dur="4.65">is possible and asked
from us right now.</text><text start="2555.86" dur="1.57">We have to turn to one another.</text><text start="2557.43" dur="3.62">We&apos;ve been given a koan, I
can&apos;t answer it by myself.</text><text start="2561.05" dur="3.57">The only answer to
that koan is from us.</text><text start="2564.62" dur="2.01">It&apos;s a collective koan.</text><text start="2566.63" dur="2.43">And the biggest
problems in our lives</text><text start="2569.06" dur="3.57">are the same as the biggest
problems in each other&apos;s lives.</text><text start="2572.63" dur="3.15">Whatever the challenges that
you are facing personally,</text><text start="2575.78" dur="3.24">they&apos;re dwarfed by our
collective challenges.</text><text start="2579.02" dur="2.19">And yet, those
are an opportunity</text><text start="2581.21" dur="3.54">for a life of meaning and
purpose and contribution.</text><text start="2584.75" dur="4.23">So that&apos;s what I&apos;m
dedicating my life to.</text><text start="2588.98" dur="5.16">At the end here, we&apos;ll put up
a slide with just a few links,</text><text start="2594.14" dur="2.62">mainly to my work, and also
to this paper I mentioned,</text><text start="2596.76" dur="3.26">which can serve as a 2

for a few questions.</text><text start="2638.37" dur="2.5">AUDIENCE: I wanted to get your
impression of the cornucopian</text><text start="2640.87" dur="2.55">myth that we&apos;re kind of
fulfilling here at Google,</text><text start="2643.42" dur="1.32">where there&apos;s kind of this--</text><text start="2644.74" dur="3.7">there&apos;s still this impression of
unlimited expansion on the web.</text><text start="2648.44" dur="3.31">So there&apos;s kind of
maybe some impression,</text><text start="2651.75" dur="3.73">there is maybe a lower
sort of material cost</text><text start="2655.48" dur="6.06">by servicing equivalent
services or products on the web,</text><text start="2661.54" dur="4.6">and as a Googler myself,
our targets every quarter</text><text start="2666.14" dur="2.54">are higher than they
were previously,</text><text start="2668.68" dur="3.3">our need to fulfill
click volume is</text><text start="2671.98" dur="1.32">kind of continuing to increase.</text><text start="2673.3" dur="1.5">I&apos;m just curious
on your perspective</text><text start="2674.8" dur="3.87">unlike first how the cornucopian
myth has sort of translated</text><text start="2678.67" dur="1.21">to the digital age.</text><text start="2679.88" dur="2.98">But also as Googlers, you know,
you said we&apos;re innovators.</text><text start="2682.86" dur="2.71">But are we also not--</text><text start="2685.57" dur="3.54">do we have a space in trying
to curb some of the expansion,</text><text start="2689.11" dur="4.001">like in turning the hit
Titanic, to your allusion there,</text><text start="2693.111" dur="0.749">from where we sit?</text><text start="2693.86" dur="3.53">TERRY PATTEN: Yeah, I
think that to some degree,</text><text start="2697.39" dur="2.88">you have to succeed in
the system that you&apos;re in,</text><text start="2700.27" dur="3.27">even if you see that it has
some unhealthy dynamics.</text><text start="2703.54" dur="5.52">So your participation in doing
your job of helping Google</text><text start="2709.06" dur="4.17">succeed this quarter
is probably not itself</text><text start="2713.23" dur="2.73">part of turning the Titanic, no.</text><text start="2715.96" dur="1.38">But it is--</text><text start="2722.35" dur="1.72">I don&apos;t think it&apos;s evil.</text><text start="2724.07" dur="2.67">I think that it&apos;s
part of perpetuating</text><text start="2726.74" dur="2.91">a system that needs to go
through a more radical change.</text><text start="2729.65" dur="10.88">And as a participant in
this process, you are--</text><text start="2740.53" dur="3.43">part of what you can do is--</text><text start="2743.96" dur="6.87">and I would recommend--
is to grow yourself into--</text><text start="2750.83" dur="3.57">like most of you Googlers
are relatively young,</text><text start="2754.4" dur="4.52">and you have a lot of life
and capacity ahead of you,</text><text start="2758.92" dur="4.06">and so as you cultivate your
consciousness and your capacity</text><text start="2762.98" dur="2.29">to be a friend to
another person,</text><text start="2765.27" dur="4.4">and there are a variety of
very ordinary human maturations</text><text start="2769.67" dur="2.55">that are necessary for you to
be the kind of leader that&apos;s</text><text start="2772.22" dur="3.15">going to be able to be
effective in changing--</text><text start="2775.37" dur="7.02">the fundamental systems redesign
is probably going to not</text><text start="2782.39" dur="4.32">be possible until there are
disruptions, positive or</text><text start="2786.71" dur="1.2">negative.</text><text start="2787.91" dur="3.15">If somebody comes up with
that cheap free alternative</text><text start="2791.06" dur="2.43">to fossil fuels, that&apos;s going
to be a massive disruption</text><text start="2793.49" dur="1.012">to the whole economy.</text><text start="2794.502" dur="1.208">That&apos;s going to change a lot.</text><text start="2795.71" dur="1.374">And you might have
an opportunity</text><text start="2797.084" dur="2.766">to write the code
for what replaces it.</text><text start="2799.85" dur="5.88">If there is a massive
ecological disaster that</text><text start="2805.73" dur="2.94">kills tens of millions
of people and shocks</text><text start="2808.67" dur="4.89">the world into a whole new
orientation to our place</text><text start="2813.56" dur="3.96">on the planet, and we&apos;ve got
countries all over the world,</text><text start="2817.52" dur="4.42">revising their international
financial agreements,</text><text start="2821.94" dur="3.26">some people-- perhaps this
isn&apos;t your area of expertise,</text><text start="2825.2" dur="0.54">I suspect.</text><text start="2825.74" dur="2.19">But we&apos;re going to be
rewriting the rules</text><text start="2827.93" dur="1.84">of our international
financial system.</text><text start="2829.77" dur="1.88">We&apos;re going to be
rewriting the back code.</text><text start="2831.65" dur="3.09">So your guys&apos; capacity to think
meta systemically and identify</text><text start="2834.74" dur="2.82">the rule sets that are going
to genuinely be sustainable</text><text start="2837.56" dur="2.07">is hugely important.</text><text start="2839.63" dur="4.68">If, for example, in
October or September,</text><text start="2844.31" dur="5.88">October, November of 2008,
the brightest young thinkers</text><text start="2850.19" dur="5.07">in financial and economic
theory were giving papers</text><text start="2855.26" dur="3.96">to Hank Paulson and Ben
Bernanke and George W. Bush that</text><text start="2859.22" dur="4.53">would have shown them a way of
making good use of that crisis,</text><text start="2863.75" dur="2.43">they could have nationalized
the banks at that time.</text><text start="2866.18" dur="2.94">They had lots of
room to really make</text><text start="2869.12" dur="1.86">fundamental systems redesign.</text><text start="2870.98" dur="2.89">Those opportunities are
going to come into being.</text><text start="2873.87" dur="2.39">So using scenario
planning, you can</text><text start="2876.26" dur="1.64">identify the crises
that are going</text><text start="2877.9" dur="2.65">to create windows of opportunity
for more fundamental systems</text><text start="2880.55" dur="2.13">redesign, and you
can be there at</text><text start="2882.68" dur="2.4">the ready with the white
papers or the thought</text><text start="2885.08" dur="2.31">through new coding
or rule sets that</text><text start="2887.39" dur="1.62">are going to make a difference.</text><text start="2889.01" dur="2.71">And you&apos;re the kind of guys
who can think in those terms.</text><text start="2891.72" dur="2.69">We really do need that
kind of leadership.</text><text start="2894.41" dur="2.88">And you don&apos;t have
to tackle the project</text><text start="2897.29" dur="4.38">as a current
deliverable that you</text><text start="2901.67" dur="3.72">have to come up with
this month or this year</text><text start="2905.39" dur="1.89">in order to begin
to prepare yourself</text><text start="2907.28" dur="2.85">to be the kind of person
in the kind of position</text><text start="2910.13" dur="2.08">that can make that
kind of difference.</text><text start="2912.21" dur="3.08">So that&apos;s kind of what
I&apos;m hoping you&apos;ll do.</text><text start="2915.29" dur="1.81">AUDIENCE: It relates
to the question--</text><text start="2917.1" dur="3.65">it relates to the point about
being epistemically humble</text><text start="2920.75" dur="3.3">and showing humility from
your particular world view,</text><text start="2924.05" dur="2.83">and being open to
other world views.</text><text start="2926.88" dur="2.93">So for example, from the
innovators&apos; perspective</text><text start="2929.81" dur="4.47">being really opening up to the
perspectives of the ecologists</text><text start="2934.28" dur="3.09">and the evolutionaries.</text><text start="2937.37" dur="2.64">Potentially, an
innovator would think</text><text start="2940.01" dur="4.95">that being open to data, for
example, as is the innovator&apos;s</text><text start="2944.96" dur="3.03">mindset, is kind of an
epistemically humble thing</text><text start="2947.99" dur="3.48">to do, because you&apos;re being
open to the data that&apos;s</text><text start="2951.47" dur="1.84">presented to you.</text><text start="2953.31" dur="4.43">So to be open to ecologists and
evolutionaries, what would that</text><text start="2957.74" dur="1.92">look like in practice?</text><text start="2959.66" dur="2.22">How would you become
more epistemically humble</text><text start="2961.88" dur="1.59">from your particular
perspective?</text><text start="2963.47" dur="1.416">TERRY PATTEN: Well,
the main thing</text><text start="2964.886" dur="2.154">is that you would
have to recognize</text><text start="2967.04" dur="6.07">that all your data derives from
data collection methods that</text><text start="2973.11" dur="2.43">are themselves
ways of quantifying</text><text start="2975.54" dur="1.95">a more complex reality.</text><text start="2977.49" dur="3.94">And therefore, they&apos;re an
incomplete map of that reality.</text><text start="2981.43" dur="2.58">And so the data
is very powerful,</text><text start="2984.01" dur="2.66">but it&apos;s not omniscient.</text><text start="2986.67" dur="5.01">And so no matter how voluminous
or good your data is,</text><text start="2991.68" dur="5.07">it is not a total
picture of reality,</text><text start="2996.75" dur="4.23">and especially, because we&apos;re
facing a critical moment</text><text start="3000.98" dur="5.16">in which we have to make such
profound whole systems change,</text><text start="3006.14" dur="4.17">the critical
leadership can&apos;t derive</text><text start="3010.31" dur="2.61">from data that is gathered
in the old pattern.</text><text start="3012.92" dur="2.43">A new pattern has
to come into being.</text><text start="3015.35" dur="2.67">And therefore, all that
you can gain from the data</text><text start="3018.02" dur="2.61">that you have is
incredibly valuable.</text><text start="3020.63" dur="2.38">But it isn&apos;t a total
view of things.</text><text start="3023.01" dur="2.55">So if you--</text><text start="3025.56" dur="4.63">I think it&apos;s easy
for us to become</text><text start="3030.19" dur="3.51">inflated by our successes.</text><text start="3033.7" dur="4.65">And data can help us succeed
famously in the marketplace</text><text start="3038.35" dur="5.8">and in commerce, and even in
the court of public opinion,</text><text start="3044.15" dur="2.03">academically, for example.</text><text start="3046.18" dur="3.18">But it won&apos;t.</text><text start="3049.36" dur="3.69">The design specs for the
challenge that we&apos;re all facing</text><text start="3053.05" dur="4.92">right now are very, very steep.</text><text start="3057.97" dur="5.34">Our ability to meet those design
specs requires us to get past,</text><text start="3063.31" dur="1.39">oh I&apos;m doing pretty well.</text><text start="3064.7" dur="2.262">My income is going up.</text><text start="3066.962" dur="4.138">Or an attractive person
has come into my life,</text><text start="3071.1" dur="3.31">and I&apos;m happy about my
relationship in the world.</text><text start="3074.41" dur="3.48">Those levels of
success are wonderful.</text><text start="3077.89" dur="1.2">I wish you all the best.</text><text start="3079.09" dur="3.71">But we&apos;ve got to crack the code
of how we turn the Titanic.</text><text start="3082.8" dur="2.17">That&apos;s a big, big challenge.</text><text start="3084.97" dur="3.83">And the existing data will
be of important relevance,</text><text start="3088.8" dur="2.01">but if we worship
the god of data,</text><text start="3090.81" dur="3.27">as if it has all the
answers, we&apos;re blinkered.</text><text start="3094.08" dur="2.69">It&apos;s just this.</text><text start="3096.77" dur="4.77">Ken Wilber, my friend
and our co-author</text><text start="3101.54" dur="2.01">of the book in
real life practice,</text><text start="3103.55" dur="3.54">uses the term
flatland to describe</text><text start="3107.09" dur="6.78">the materialist scientific,
objectivist perspective</text><text start="3113.87" dur="2.85">that tends to dominate
among innovators.</text><text start="3116.72" dur="4.33">And its biggest
liability is arrogance.</text><text start="3121.05" dur="2.84">It succeeds in many
ways, but it then</text><text start="3123.89" dur="2.19">becomes epistemically closed.</text><text start="3126.08" dur="1.39">It lacks that humility.</text><text start="3127.47" dur="4.79">So simply taking on board the
fact that you do know a lot,</text><text start="3132.26" dur="2.22">you can see a lot, the
data shows us a lot,</text><text start="3134.48" dur="1.83">it&apos;s really
valuable, most people</text><text start="3136.31" dur="1.65">can&apos;t understand
it or crunch it,</text><text start="3137.96" dur="2.82">and I can, and I&apos;m
able to contribute</text><text start="3140.78" dur="3.15">something that&apos;s of real
significance, that&apos;s</text><text start="3143.93" dur="0.51">not enough.</text><text start="3144.44" dur="3.15">That level of
success-- if you end up</text><text start="3147.59" dur="4.94">having lived a life in which
you had a successful position</text><text start="3152.53" dur="3.12">in a corporation that was part
of a pattern that destroyed</text><text start="3155.65" dur="4.12">the world that your great
grandchildren would have</text><text start="3159.77" dur="4.03">inherited, your success
is pretty tainted.</text><text start="3163.8" dur="2.6">So if you bring in the
kind of humility that</text><text start="3166.4" dur="3.7">cares to really be the change
we want to see in the world,</text><text start="3170.1" dur="5.0">then your relationship to
the data becomes serious.</text><text start="3175.1" dur="5.43">And you don&apos;t cease to
notice all the opportunities</text><text start="3180.53" dur="1.2">and possibilities.</text><text start="3181.73" dur="2.79">But you don&apos;t confuse
them with omniscience.</text><text start="3184.52" dur="1.98">You break below that.</text><text start="3186.5" dur="3.66">And yes, letting the
data inform your choices</text><text start="3190.16" dur="5.319">is brilliant and important,
but it&apos;s not a panacea.</text><text start="3195.479" dur="0.541">AUDIENCE: OK.</text><text start="3196.02" dur="1.82">And with that, we&apos;ve
come to the end.</text><text start="3197.84" dur="2.25">So Terry, on behalf
of Google, thank</text><text start="3200.09" dur="3.1">you so much for sharing your
time and wisdom with us today.</text><text start="3203.19" dur="1.66">Thank you.</text></transcript>
