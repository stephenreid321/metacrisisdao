dur="4.481">you know these questions get difficult</text><text start="21.539" dur="2.4">to answer</text><text start="23.34" dur="4.74">um</text><text start="23.939" dur="6.061">so uh we can&apos;t really see you but I</text><text start="28.08" dur="4.62">think you can see us</text><text start="30.0" dur="4.2">just so you know we can&apos;t see you so if</text><text start="32.7" dur="5.16">you start sticking your tongues out at</text><text start="34.2" dur="5.879">us or anything we will have no idea we</text><text start="37.86" dur="4.879">are staring into artificial Suns and</text><text

start="54.78" dur="5.82">this conversation is going to go tonight</text><text start="57.6" dur="4.139">and we&apos;re touching into</text><text start="60.6" dur="4.98">um</text><text start="61.739" dur="8.461">topics and stories that I think neither</text><text start="65.58" dur="7.98">one of us uh certainly are are in</text><text start="70.2" dur="4.86">the habit of bringing into our public</text><text start="73.56" dur="3.419">discourse</text><text start="75.06" dur="3.239">so both of us do a lot of public</text><text start="76.979" dur="4.68">speaking</text><text start="78.299" dur="5.041">both of us are working with the concept</text><text start="81.659" dur="4.261">of how do we</text><text start="83.34" dur="5.04">potentially make the changes we need to</text><text start="85.92" dur="6.9">make to keep</text><text start="88.38" dur="6.559">our species and several others around</text><text start="92.82" dur="2.119">um</text><text start="96.54" dur="3.899">but this time we&apos;re taking this</text><text start="98.759" dur="3.921">conversation somewhere slightly</text><text start="100.439" dur="2.241">different</text><text start="102.72" dur="3.3">um and and I&apos;m excited about that</text><text start="104.46" dur="4.68">because</text><text start="106.02" dur="6.059">the question that is kind of underneath</text><text start="109.14" dur="4.619">all of this for me is the question that</text><text start="112.079" dur="5.101">we sometimes ask in the warm data work</text><text start="113.759" dur="6.421">which is what is continuing</text><text start="117.18" dur="7.02">what&apos;s continuing and in any kind of</text><text start="120.18" dur="6.24">evolutionary process there is a need for</text><text start="124.2" dur="5.46">there to be continuance</text><text start="126.42" dur="6.24">you cannot have continuance without</text><text start="129.66" dur="3.0">discontinuance</text><text start="133.34" dur="8.08">organisms have to change in order to</text><text start="137.28" dur="7.2">stay in the in in the ecologies as they</text><text start="141.42" dur="5.819">change contexts change if you don&apos;t</text><text start="144.48" dur="4.5">change you become obsolete</text><text start="147.239" dur="3.961">if you change too much you become</text><text start="148.98" dur="4.7">obsolete</text><text start="151.2" dur="4.44">so how do we not become obsolete now</text><text start="153.68" dur="5.559">this is</text><text start="155.64" dur="5.94">um interestingly I I think an</text><text start="159.239" dur="5.461">intergenerational question</text><text start="161.58" dur="6.18">uh and very frequently when we look out</text><text start="164.7" dur="3.96">at the the way in which</text><text start="167.76" dur="4.08">um</text><text start="168.66" dur="5.84">change projects are structured</text><text start="171.84" dur="7.46">they seem to be structured toward</text><text start="174.5" dur="4.8">solutioning for the problems</text><text start="180.84" dur="5.88">but this territory of what happens</text><text start="183.78" dur="3.86">between parents and children</text><text start="186.72" dur="3.36">between</text><text start="187.64" dur="7.36">adults and elders</text><text start="190.08" dur="7.2">between grandparents and ancestors</text><text start="195.0" dur="5.54">this question</text><text start="197.28" dur="6.12">is hardly ever in the room</text><text start="200.54" dur="5.44">where did we learn to have a</text><text start="203.4" dur="5.339">relationship with nature</text><text start="205.98" dur="5.94">with each other with the idea of</text><text start="208.739" dur="6.42">identity or idea of success</text><text start="211.92" dur="6.0">who did you learn to be</text><text start="215.159" dur="5.421">at The Breakfast Table</text><text start="217.92" dur="7.44">how is the person that you are now</text><text start="220.58" dur="7.18">somehow a ruminating a Rippling of those</text><text start="225.36" dur="4.32">Generations that came before you in ways</text><text start="227.76" dur="5.1">that some of which you may be aware of</text><text start="229.68" dur="5.279">but many of which you&apos;re not</text><text start="232.86" dur="3.959">who are you</text><text start="234.959" dur="5.101">who am I</text><text start="236.819" dur="5.101">and what are the ways in which the</text><text start="240.06" dur="3.78">person that I think I am and the person</text><text start="241.92" dur="3.78">that you think you are</text><text start="243.84" dur="5.36">are actually</text><text start="245.7" dur="3.5">holding each other</text><text start="249.48" dur="5.039">into those systems</text><text start="252.299" dur="4.821">that we spend our days thinking we&apos;d</text><text start="254.519" dur="2.601">like to change</text><text start="259.199" dur="6.301">are we keeping each other</text><text start="262.079" dur="6.301">in the perpetuating existing systems</text><text start="265.5" dur="5.28">with our ideas of identity and Prestige</text><text start="268.38" dur="3.599">of what it is to be apparent what it is</text><text start="270.78" dur="3.9">to be</text><text start="271.979" dur="5.701">taking care of an elder what it is to be</text><text start="274.68" dur="6.0">in this Society</text><text start="277.68" dur="6.959">so so this intergenerational question</text><text start="280.68" dur="5.76">for me is really resonant with where&apos;s</text><text start="284.639" dur="3.241">the change now one interesting thing</text><text start="286.44" dur="4.02">here is that</text><text start="287.88" dur="4.62">both Daniel and I</text><text start="290.46" dur="4.14">and I don&apos;t know the stories and he</text><text start="292.5" dur="4.5">doesn&apos;t know my story so</text><text start="294.6" dur="3.72">you know we we&apos;re riding skateboards up</text><text start="297.0" dur="4.5">here</text><text start="298.32" dur="5.46">um we both grew up in really uh</text><text start="301.5" dur="6.419">unorthodox ways</text><text start="303.78" dur="6.06">and I think it&apos;s no surprise that we are</text><text start="307.919" dur="5.041">both</text><text start="309.84" dur="7.04">thinking about the changes in the world</text><text start="312.96" dur="3.92">in unorthodox ways</text><text start="318.84" dur="4.799">so what</text><text start="321.12" dur="6.24">can we bring what can we share what can</text><text start="323.639" dur="6.181">we explore together in this</text><text start="327.36" dur="6.3">territory</text><text start="329.82" dur="6.26">that might be generative and useful and</text><text start="333.66" dur="5.28">at very least amusing</text><text start="336.08" dur="6.399">for each other and for you</text><text start="338.94" dur="5.52">so so Daniel I want to put you on the</text><text start="342.479" dur="3.121">spot a little bit because</text><text start="344.46" dur="3.42">um</text><text start="345.6" dur="5.7">I don&apos;t think that we can have anything</text><text start="347.88" dur="6.48">in this conversation if we don&apos;t have as</text><text start="351.3" dur="5.82">an assumption The Meta crisis</text><text start="354.36" dur="4.92">so I think we could say that for a whole</text><text start="357.12" dur="4.5">lot of situations that the Assumption at</text><text start="359.28" dur="4.5">this point needs to be the meta crisis</text><text start="361.62" dur="3.9">but if you were going to give us a quick</text><text start="363.78" dur="4.139">version</text><text start="365.52" dur="4.14">of this thing called The Meta crisis so</text><text start="367.919" dur="4.321">it&apos;s in the room so that everything else</text><text start="369.66" dur="4.74">we&apos;re talking about is predicated on</text><text start="372.24" dur="4.679">this okay</text><text start="374.4" dur="5.06">um how would you do that it&apos;s so great</text><text start="376.919" dur="2.541">to see you</text><text start="379.919" dur="3.421">well</text><text start="381.18" dur="3.84">um it&apos;s fun that we&apos;re doing this and</text><text start="383.34" dur="3.78">that we don&apos;t know where we&apos;re going to</text><text start="385.02" dur="4.08">go in the conversation and</text><text start="387.12" dur="3.96">everybody who I got to meet briefly</text><text start="389.1" dur="3.659">coming in seemed like great people so</text><text start="391.08" dur="3.179">this seems I don&apos;t know it seems like a</text><text start="392.759" dur="2.461">cool Community</text><text start="394.259" dur="3.72">um</text><text start="395.22" dur="4.319">I know the video quality wants it is</text><text start="397.979" dur="3.961">there any way this can turn down the</text><text start="399.539" dur="4.261">tiniest bit because I&apos;m mostly in full</text><text start="401.94" dur="3.78">blindness</text><text start="403.8" dur="3.239">um</text><text start="405.72" dur="4.08">is</text><text start="407.039" dur="3.481">so much better thank you</text><text start="409.8" dur="2.399">um</text><text start="410.52" dur="2.82">is anyone not familiar with the meta</text><text start="412.199" dur="3.84">crisis</text><text start="413.34" dur="6.5">just hands so I have a sense</text><text start="416.039" dur="3.801">I&apos;ll try to do this very briefly then</text><text start="420.96" dur="5.64">it&apos;s actually a [ __ ] up thing to ask</text><text start="424.02" dur="6.36">um sorry</text><text start="426.6" dur="5.939">no I don&apos;t mean for me I mean to like</text><text start="430.38" dur="4.68">there&apos;s a emotional existential weight</text><text start="432.539" dur="5.16">of the topic for everybody else to just</text><text start="435.06" dur="5.1">enter and then not actually process but</text><text start="437.699" dur="7.5">whatever you ask for it</text><text start="440.16" dur="7.92">um so a big part of my work is looking</text><text start="445.199" dur="5.521">at catastrophic risks facing the world</text><text start="448.08" dur="5.22">catastrophic and existential risks</text><text start="450.72" dur="4.5">a lot of people focus on this topic the</text><text start="453.3" dur="4.019">lens through which I have focused on it</text><text start="455.22" dur="4.199">is</text><text start="457.319" dur="3.841">um looking not just at catastrophic</text><text start="459.419" dur="4.62">risks in the areas</text><text start="461.16" dur="4.379">in in the ways that we normally Silo it</text><text start="464.039" dur="3.621">so obviously militaries look at</text><text start="465.539" dur="4.081">escalation Pathways to large-scale war</text><text start="467.66" dur="4.24">environmentalists look at environmental</text><text start="469.62" dur="5.16">risks which there&apos;s some unifying</text><text start="471.9" dur="4.859">Frameworks to not just look at species</text><text start="474.78" dur="3.539">Extinction or climate change or soil</text><text start="476.759" dur="3.421">erosion but things like planetary</text><text start="478.319" dur="6.061">boundaries that look at many different</text><text start="480.18" dur="6.299">uh catastrophic risks there are groups</text><text start="484.38" dur="3.36">like the big group at Oxford and</text><text start="486.479" dur="3.78">Cambridge and others that look at</text><text start="487.74" dur="4.859">exponential Tech risks risks that could</text><text start="490.259" dur="4.321">have never happened when we didn&apos;t have</text><text start="492.599" dur="3.54">as powerful a Technologies emerging like</text><text start="494.58" dur="4.86">the risks associated with synthetic</text><text start="496.139" dur="4.5">biology and Ai and nanotech and cyber</text><text start="499.44" dur="5.64">and drones</text><text start="500.639" dur="6.12">so each of these risks also Acts also</text><text start="505.08" dur="3.239">acts like a force multiplier for the</text><text start="506.759" dur="5.22">other ones so</text><text start="508.319" dur="6.181">if we look at the nature of the social</text><text start="511.979" dur="4.86">media algorithms optimizing for</text><text start="514.5" dur="5.279">engagement and the optimization for</text><text start="516.839" dur="4.921">engagement often looks like things that</text><text start="519.779" dur="4.981">scare us or upset us or drive tribal</text><text start="521.76" dur="4.62">identities it&apos;s pretty easy to see that</text><text start="524.76" dur="3.36">the social media algorithms Drive</text><text start="526.38" dur="6.0">polarization</text><text start="528.12" dur="6.719">the polarized population in a Democratic</text><text start="532.38" dur="5.579">Society ends up electing a polarized</text><text start="534.839" dur="5.041">representative class causes gridlock and</text><text start="537.959" dur="3.721">open societies closed societies</text><text start="539.88" dur="4.139">authoritarian societies don&apos;t have that</text><text start="541.68" dur="4.14">issue so you end up getting a net</text><text start="544.019" dur="4.151">movement as a result of that towards</text><text start="545.82" dur="3.06">autocracies being more effective</text><text start="548.17" dur="1.25">[Music]</text><text start="548.88" dur="2.639">um</text><text start="549.42" dur="4.26">but you can see that the social media</text><text start="551.519" dur="4.32">issue is like a crisis in itself but</text><text start="553.68" dur="3.54">it&apos;s also a force multiplier for all the</text><text start="555.839" dur="2.661">other issues because we can&apos;t solve</text><text start="557.22" dur="3.119">climate change of half the population</text><text start="558.5" dur="3.82">disagrees with anything the other half</text><text start="560.339" dur="2.821">the population wants to do or covet or</text><text start="562.32" dur="3.48">anything</text><text start="563.16" dur="4.32">you can look at climate change as a risk</text><text start="565.8" dur="3.84">in and of itself but also as a force</text><text start="567.48" dur="4.14">multiplier because as soon as you look</text><text start="569.64" dur="4.139">at not just total venusification of the</text><text start="571.62" dur="5.12">planet but things like extreme weather</text><text start="573.779" dur="5.701">events causing uh human migration</text><text start="576.74" dur="5.68">and Refugee issues</text><text start="579.48" dur="4.5">I think Sweden is very acutely aware of</text><text start="582.42" dur="4.38">refugee issues currently and the fact</text><text start="583.98" dur="4.5">that after Syria nobody wants climate</text><text start="586.8" dur="4.02">change mediated refugees coming into</text><text start="588.48" dur="5.039">their country and yet you&apos;re about to</text><text start="590.82" dur="4.74">you know U.N predicts 300 million and</text><text start="593.519" dur="3.481">some groups predict up to a billion</text><text start="595.56" dur="2.88">climate change refugees in the next</text><text start="597.0" dur="3.12">handful of years somewhere between five</text><text start="598.44" dur="4.2">and ten years so what does the world do</text><text start="600.12" dur="4.56">with that well that acts as a force</text><text start="602.64" dur="3.9">multiplier for resource Wars which can</text><text start="604.68" dur="3.659">then become large-scale Wars which can</text><text start="606.54" dur="4.739">become collapse to supply chains on and</text><text start="608.339" dur="4.261">on so the meta crisis is looking at not</text><text start="611.279" dur="4.801">just the individual risk but the</text><text start="612.6" dur="4.859">Cascades between them and the underlying</text><text start="616.08" dur="3.6">drivers that they all have in common</text><text start="617.459" dur="5.281">whether we&apos;re talking about climate</text><text start="619.68" dur="4.86">change or war or</text><text start="622.74" dur="3.599">um forever chemicals in the environment</text><text start="624.54" dur="4.26">we can see that perverse economic</text><text start="626.339" dur="4.921">incentive is a driver of all of them we</text><text start="628.8" dur="4.02">can see that externalities where we&apos;re</text><text start="631.26" dur="3.06">optimizing for one thing but causing</text><text start="632.82" dur="3.12">harm somewhere else as a driver in all</text><text start="634.32" dur="4.86">of them we can see that multi-polar</text><text start="635.94" dur="4.98">traps where one group</text><text start="639.18" dur="3.18">feels like it has to do the [ __ ] up</text><text start="640.92" dur="2.7">thing because another group is doing it</text><text start="642.36" dur="3.18">and if the other group does it there&apos;s</text><text start="643.62" dur="3.839">so much competitive Advantage so nobody</text><text start="645.54" dur="3.12">wants to give up the nukes first because</text><text start="647.459" dur="3.841">maybe the other guy didn&apos;t really give</text><text start="648.66" dur="5.22">up the nukes right and nobody wants to</text><text start="651.3" dur="4.26">price carbon properly because if Western</text><text start="653.88" dur="3.899">countries price carbon properly and</text><text start="655.56" dur="4.5">China doesn&apos;t all it is is a seeding of</text><text start="657.779" dur="4.981">the world to autocracy running the 21st</text><text start="660.06" dur="4.5">century and nobody wants to agree to not</text><text start="662.76" dur="3.18">build AI weapons because how do we know</text><text start="664.56" dur="2.88">that the other guy&apos;s not building AI</text><text start="665.94" dur="3.06">weapons in an underground military base</text><text start="667.44" dur="3.06">so we&apos;re just an all-out race for</text><text start="669.0" dur="2.94">everybody to build them which increases</text><text start="670.5" dur="3.66">the likelihood that everybody dies from</text><text start="671.94" dur="4.019">them so if we can&apos;t solve multi-polar</text><text start="674.16" dur="3.78">traps or coordination issues we can&apos;t</text><text start="675.959" dur="4.201">solve any of the things so the meta</text><text start="677.94" dur="5.519">crisis is basically saying</text><text start="680.16" dur="5.82">that there&apos;s not one or a few</text><text start="683.459" dur="5.161">catastrophes facing civilization there</text><text start="685.98" dur="5.28">is a whole series of them many many</text><text start="688.62" dur="4.44">different escalation Pathways that are</text><text start="691.26" dur="3.12">the result of very deep civilizational</text><text start="693.06" dur="5.399">structures</text><text start="694.38" dur="6.18">and that unless we change things like</text><text start="698.459" dur="4.861">the global economic system writ large</text><text start="700.56" dur="4.68">you can&apos;t have a our global economic</text><text start="703.32"

dur="5.94">monogamy</text><text start="1563.539" dur="5.461">was something that had emerged as the</text><text start="1567.08" dur="3.959">dominant system because it worked much</text><text

this</text><text start="1882.559" dur="5.581">visitation</text><text start="1884.36" dur="6.66">um I had recently to Japan and</text><text start="1888.14" dur="5.519">um while I was in Japan I went to</text><text start="1891.02" dur="5.82">see some Artisans that were there</text><text start="1893.659" dur="5.161">and I was introduced to a family that</text><text start="1896.84" dur="4.8">was

start="2051.04" dur="5.52">and and that was impressive you had to</text><text start="2053.32" dur="6.72">take on that that&apos;s that career you had</text><text start="2056.56" dur="5.4">to you were limited by those sexual</text><text start="2060.04" dur="4.859">options you were limited by those</text><text start="2061.96" dur="5.04">spiritual or religious options and</text><text start="2064.899" dur="4.801">um and so getting free from the family</text><text start="2067.0" dur="5.399">was really important because it allowed</text><text start="2069.7" dur="4.26">for this beginnings of all these new</text><text start="2072.399" dur="4.141">ideas</text><text start="2073.96" dur="5.419">and ways of living</text><text start="2076.54" dur="2.839">um and then</text><text start="2079.48" dur="6.0">here we are and it&apos;s gotten very messy</text><text start="2082.48" dur="7.139">and I have kids</text><text start="2085.48" dur="6.78">I have two kids that came from my womb</text><text start="2089.619" dur="4.02">and my husband&apos;s got four kids and they</text><text start="2092.26" dur="3.78">you know are two different cultures</text><text start="2093.639" dur="7.321">Swedish and American Kids</text><text start="2096.04" dur="7.559">and they range in age from 16 to 29.</text><text start="2100.96" dur="4.379">and uh</text><text start="2103.599" dur="3.601">how do I</text><text start="2105.339" dur="5.181">help them</text><text start="2107.2" dur="6.78">to be in the world right now</text><text start="2110.52" dur="7.079">in a way that allows them to be in</text><text

what&apos;s coming I mean</text><text start="2138.16" dur="4.4">you can like you were asking about how</text><text start="2140.32" dur="4.68">would you if you were a mother in</text><text

very</text><text start="2152.079" dur="3.661">serious question of how do we teach our</text><text start="2154.18" dur="3.8">kids something that we actually don&apos;t</text><text start="2155.74" dur="2.24">know</text><text start="2158.2" dur="8.04">and it puts it puts us in a difficult</text><text start="2161.2" dur="7.02">relationship with that role of parent</text><text start="2166.24" dur="5.72">um you know your kids failing math well</text><text start="2168.22" dur="3.74">you have to do well in math why</text><text start="2172.48" dur="3.0">um</text><text start="2173.68" dur="4.98">that&apos;s questions getting harder and</text><text start="2175.48" dur="6.54">harder to answer actually</text><text start="2178.66" dur="6.419">um and you know I think for me with my</text><text start="2182.02" dur="5.76">kids I first of all I I was pulled out</text><text start="2185.079" dur="4.981">of school and homeschooled for I think</text><text start="2187.78" dur="6.299">three four years of my</text><text start="2190.06" dur="6.24">uh life my father had cancer and when my</text><text start="2194.079" dur="4.741">father had cancer we moved</text><text start="2196.3" dur="4.319">to Big Sur California and the school was</text><text start="2198.82" dur="3.66">really far away and I used to just throw</text><text start="2200.619" dur="3.601">up on the bus so he said why don&apos;t you</text><text start="2202.48" dur="3.24">just come I only have a little time left</text><text start="2204.22" dur="3.96">just be here</text><text start="2205.72" dur="4.379">and so I was homeschooled and it was</text><text start="2208.18" dur="3.84">really unstructured there was no such</text><text start="2210.099" dur="5.041">thing as homeschooling then it was</text><text start="2212.02" dur="5.099">actually called truancy at that point</text><text start="2215.14" dur="5.04">um and it was</text><text start="2217.119" dur="6.48">chargeable by law in fact it was illegal</text><text start="2220.18" dur="4.919">but nevertheless we got away with it and</text><text start="2223.599" dur="3.24">we did math</text><text start="2225.099" dur="3.781">we would have these conversations about</text><text start="2226.839" dur="3.601">math we&apos;d take walks in the forest and</text><text start="2228.88" dur="3.3">he would tell me the Latin names of</text><text start="2230.44" dur="3.78">everything and how it reproduced and I</text><text start="2232.18" dur="4.5">would travel with him and I would sit in</text><text start="2234.22" dur="4.02">on his workshops and I was at esselyn</text><text start="2236.68" dur="3.659">and Joseph Campbell was there talking</text><text start="2238.24" dur="5.94">about mythology and Alan Watts was there</text><text start="2240.339" dur="6.24">talking about you know religion and Carl</text><text start="2244.18" dur="4.14">Rogers was talking about psychology and</text><text start="2246.579" dur="4.5">I thought I got a pretty good education</text><text start="2248.32" dur="3.779">for a 10 year old you know</text><text start="2251.079" dur="4.201">um</text><text start="2252.099" dur="7.321">but then I went back to school</text><text start="2255.28" dur="6.78">my dad died and I went back to school</text><text start="2259.42" dur="6.12">and it was like hell I mean I have to</text><text start="2262.06" dur="6.9">tell you like even the memory of those</text><text start="2265.54" dur="6.92">those first moments of going back into</text><text start="2268.96" dur="3.5">the classroom it was like</text><text start="2272.8" dur="5.58">everything beautiful in the world just</text><text start="2276.339" dur="5.041">ran out of the room</text><text start="2278.38" dur="5.16">they all the subjects were divided and</text><text start="2281.38" dur="4.56">math was no longer fun I was like</text><text start="2283.54" dur="6.24">writing papers for my father&apos;s college</text><text start="2285.94" dur="6.179">classes on how to think in base five</text><text start="2289.78" dur="4.74">and and because he was teaching</text><text start="2292.119" dur="3.661">University classes on perception so he</text><text start="2294.52" dur="2.94">was just going to get his nine-year-old</text><text start="2295.78" dur="3.72">daughter to write a paper on how to</text><text start="2297.46" dur="4.98">think in base five</text><text start="2299.5" dur="7.38">perfectly reasonable right and then I</text><text start="2302.44" dur="6.96">went into you know ninth grade math and</text><text start="2306.88" dur="5.1">I was like this is horrible</text><text start="2309.4" dur="5.4">this isn&apos;t fun this isn&apos;t groovy this is</text><text start="2311.98" dur="5.76">I think I barely got by with a C</text><text start="2314.8" dur="5.88">and I never wanted to do math again</text><text start="2317.74" dur="5.64">but um</text><text start="2320.68" dur="4.5">I had this experience of what it could</text><text start="2323.38" dur="4.92">be</text><text start="2325.18" dur="6.419">what education could be and so when I</text><text start="2328.3" dur="6.0">had kids I took them out of school</text><text start="2331.599" dur="7.081">we were moving from California to</text><text start="2334.3" dur="7.08">Vancouver Canada and so my California</text><text start="2338.68" dur="4.439">legal World kind of thought I was going</text><text start="2341.38" dur="3.86">to Canada and the Canadian World thought</text><text start="2343.119" dur="5.22">we were still moving and at that point</text><text start="2345.24" dur="5.08">my husband their father at the time</text><text start="2348.339" dur="4.02">he&apos;s still their father my husband at</text><text start="2350.32" dur="3.9">the time their father</text><text start="2352.359" dur="4.521">um and we just were like okay let&apos;s go</text><text start="2354.22" dur="5.04">and so we essentially stole our children</text><text start="2356.88" dur="4.18">from the system</text><text start="2359.26" dur="3.24">but I imagine this might sound a little</text><text start="2361.06" dur="3.96">radical to you</text><text start="2362.5" dur="4.619">um we stole our children and we went on</text><text start="2365.02" dur="4.86">this fantastic Adventure</text><text start="2367.119" dur="5.46">it was an incredible privilege we went</text><text start="2369.88" dur="5.88">down into South America and we</text><text start="2372.579" dur="6.961">went and we we learned that we we went</text><text start="2375.76" dur="6.66">to a language class in Cusco</text><text start="2379.54" dur="4.5">Spanish intro to Spanish with just the</text><text start="2382.42" dur="4.08">family</text><text start="2384.04" dur="4.079">so it was intergenerational language</text><text start="2386.5" dur="4.619">learning</text><text start="2388.119" dur="6.601">and we were all at the beginning</text><text start="2391.119" dur="7.621">and so we got to see how each other</text><text start="2394.72" dur="6.6">learned that was just fascinating so my</text><text start="2398.74" dur="5.04">kids could see you know ways in which I</text><text start="2401.32" dur="3.24">was struggling and I could ask them for</text><text start="2403.78" dur="3.299">help</text><text start="2404.56" dur="4.32">and they they could see you know my</text><text start="2407.079" dur="4.5">husband get irritated that some you know</text><text start="2408.88" dur="5.1">it was really a very interesting</text><text start="2411.579" dur="7.861">experiment what year</text><text start="2413.98" dur="8.52">what year that would have been 2000 and</text><text start="2419.44" dur="5.34">five or six yeah</text><text start="2422.5" dur="4.079">why it just</text><text start="2424.78" dur="4.799">um I just think it&apos;s fun hearing that</text><text start="2426.579" dur="5.701">part of the story when I finished my uh</text><text start="2429.579" dur="4.981">undergrad I took a one-way plane ticket</text><text start="2432.28" dur="5.52">to Peru and landed in Cusco and started</text><text start="2434.56" dur="4.26">with a weak immersion class and uh right</text><text start="2437.8" dur="3.6">here</text><text start="2438.82" dur="4.08">that would have been 2001. so not a lot</text><text start="2441.4" dur="3.12">far apart</text><text start="2442.9" dur="3.98">that would have been a funny coincidence</text><text start="2444.52" dur="2.36">yeah</text><text start="2447.28" dur="3.6">um so so we pulled the kids out of</text><text start="2449.079" dur="7.26">school for six months that was the idea</text><text start="2450.88" dur="7.979">and um when we we did an hour of reading</text><text start="2456.339" dur="4.02">and an hour of writing they could write</text><text start="2458.859" dur="3.841">whatever they wanted</text><text start="2460.359" dur="4.081">and I had these little Math workbooks I</text><text start="2462.7" dur="3.659">did an hour of math with them every once</text><text start="2464.44" dur="4.2">in a while not every day</text><text start="2466.359" dur="3.72">well when we got back</text><text start="2468.64" dur="5.88">I couldn&apos;t put them back in the school</text><text start="2470.079" dur="7.141">because they were two years ahead</text><text start="2474.52" dur="4.68">and I wasn&apos;t even remotely trying to get</text><text start="2477.22" dur="3.96">them ahead actually I was just we were</text><text start="2479.2" dur="3.72">just traveling and and having this</text><text start="2481.18" dur="3.659">amazing trip but</text><text start="2482.92" dur="3.24">I just wanted to be sure that I could</text><text start="2484.839" dur="4.561">you know that we weren&apos;t losing any</text><text start="2486.16" dur="6.24">ground and you know I couldn&apos;t put them</text><text start="2489.4" dur="5.1">back in then we had another problem</text><text start="2492.4" dur="4.74">so we thought well okay uh what we need</text><text start="2494.5" dur="4.8">to do is stall so we took another six</text><text start="2497.14" dur="5.34">months to finish out the school year and</text><text start="2499.3" dur="4.74">I I actually hired a tutor because I</text><text start="2502.48" dur="4.4">didn&apos;t have any more time to do this it</text><text start="2504.04" dur="6.36">takes a lot of time to be that person</text><text start="2506.88" dur="6.219">and so this tutor was a former teacher</text><text start="2510.4" dur="6.36">who had gotten glaucoma and gone blind</text><text start="2513.099" dur="5.821">and so they had a blind tutor and he</text><text start="2516.76" dur="3.78">they the project was just spend the next</text><text start="2518.92" dur="3.72">six months reading a few Shakespeare</text><text start="2520.54" dur="4.74">plays</text><text start="2522.64" dur="4.92">so they went line by line through</text><text start="2525.28" dur="4.74">Macbeth through Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream</text><text start="2527.56" dur="4.68">through Richard III</text><text start="2530.02" dur="4.26">and oops</text><text start="2532.24" dur="4.379">that accidentally made it much worse</text><text start="2534.28" dur="4.68">because in fact they and then they</text><text start="2536.619" dur="4.261">learned poetry they learned history they</text><text start="2538.96" dur="5.399">learned psychology they learned about</text><text start="2540.88" dur="5.699">all this different stuff</text><text start="2544.359" dur="4.74">and it was actually a very systemic</text><text start="2546.579" dur="6.121">education they were they were comparing</text><text start="2549.099" dur="6.421">the the great soliloquies with famous</text><text start="2552.7" dur="5.1">speeches by Martin Luther King or by</text><text start="2555.52" dur="4.559">Hitler or by right they were comparing</text><text start="2557.8" dur="4.86">soliloquies and Shakespeare with with</text><text start="2560.079" dur="3.961">with historical figures</text><text start="2562.66" dur="5.24">um</text><text start="2564.04" dur="3.86">and then I put them back in school</text><text start="2569.38" dur="4.62">as I was thinking about this I was</text><text start="2571.3" dur="5.64">talking to my daughter who&apos;s now 27 and</text><text start="2574.0" dur="5.4">I and she said to me the other day</text><text start="2576.94" dur="4.56">she and her husband to be have

think</text><text start="2686.14" dur="4.5">when you study the</text><text start="2688.0" dur="4.92">history of civilizational collapse when</text><text start="2690.64" dur="3.959">the Roman Empire

to get to</text><text start="3070.68" dur="3.96">say all right well what would it look</text><text start="3072.359" dur="4.74">like to have a civilization system and</text><text start="3074.64"

dur="3.78">they have the bikini thing and then they</text><text start="3103.2" dur="2.94">have to talk right there&apos;s some</text><text start="3104.94" dur="3.179">interview</text><text start="3106.14" dur="4.199">well she was the first person to be in</text><text start="3108.119" dur="5.161">the interview part</text><text start="3110.339" dur="4.921">and they asked her the question</text><text start="3113.28" dur="5.579">if you were a parent what would you</text><text start="3115.26" dur="6.12">teach your child but she misheard it</text><text start="3118.859" dur="5.541">and what she heard was if you were a</text><text start="3121.38" dur="7.08">parrot what would you teach your child</text><text start="3124.4" dur="6.959">and so she made the response it&apos;s</text><text start="3128.46" dur="5.82">probably the best parenting advice ever</text><text start="3131.359" dur="5.621">which is I would teach them how to catch</text><text start="3134.28" dur="3.96">worms and how to fly</text><text start="3136.98" dur="5.359">and</text><text start="3138.24" dur="4.099">you know actually it&apos;s pretty good</text><text start="3143.16" dur="5.52">um because in a way that is</text><text start="3146.52" dur="3.599">what we need to do</text><text start="3148.68" dur="3.3">is</text><text start="3150.119" dur="4.141">um be</text><text start="3151.98" dur="5.28">careful</text><text start="3154.26" dur="6.599">about the flexibility of that</text><text start="3157.26" dur="7.14">um and and the other thing is it&apos;s not</text><text start="3160.859" dur="5.46">just parent child I really want to hold</text><text start="3164.4" dur="4.199">that in this room that when we&apos;re</text><text start="3166.319" dur="5.221">talking intergenerational

start="3233.22" dur="4.5">um but this</text><text start="3234.9" dur="5.04">is a fantastic ripoff because since</text><text start="3237.72" dur="5.46">she&apos;s been in my house</text><text start="3239.94" dur="5.46">I have learned more about how to live</text><text start="3243.18" dur="4.5">and incidentally how I don&apos;t want to</text><text start="3245.4" dur="5.159">live okay because this is something that</text><text start="3247.68" dur="5.04">our parents can teach us not just</text><text start="3250.559" dur="4.201">how to live and what wisdom they have</text><text

continuity</text><text start="3258.42" dur="4.26">and the discontinuity and I am so</text><text start="3261.72" dur="3.06">grateful</text><text start="3262.68" dur="4.879">for the ways in which she

of households</text><text start="3626.88" dur="5.28">what you get is you get a chore wheel</text><text start="3629.04" dur="4.92">or you get a you know um</text><text start="3632.16" dur="4.139">who&apos;s going to do what when Community</text><text start="3633.96" dur="3.839">you know intentional communities are</text><text start="3636.299" dur="3.841">famous for this</text><text

had a this Retreat recently at</text><text start="3656.7" dur="4.2">my house with these people that have</text><text start="3658.799" dur="3.601">been doing warm data with me and we had</text><text start="3660.9" dur="4.86">this moment where I was like well let&apos;s</text><text start="3662.4" dur="6.5">make the chore wheel like now what if we</text><text start="3665.76" dur="3.14">just don&apos;t</text><text start="3669.9" dur="7.74">what if we actually just leave that to</text><text start="3674.42" dur="5.08">the need to pay attention to the</text><text start="3677.64" dur="4.86">relationships</text><text start="3679.5" dur="4.92">in the group</text><text start="3682.5" dur="4.92">40 people in a group</text><text start="3684.42" dur="7.8">that&apos;s a lot of dishes</text><text start="3687.42" dur="7.439">so what if we just did that and um</text><text start="3692.22" dur="4.92">it because I had been you know with my</text><text start="3694.859" dur="4.44">own kids thinking about well</text><text start="3697.14" dur="4.199">if I teach them that it&apos;s important to</text><text start="3699.299" dur="4.8">do the dishes on Wednesday</text><text start="3701.339" dur="6.541">I have taught them to look at this</text><text start="3704.099" dur="5.881">abstracted version of what makes</text><text start="3707.88" dur="6.239">responsibility</text><text start="3709.98" dur="6.42">if I take the time to teach them</text><text start="3714.119" dur="4.561">to pay attention to the relationships in</text><text start="3716.4" dur="4.199">the room who needs to do the dishes</text><text start="3718.68" dur="3.2">tonight is not really about whether it&apos;s</text><text start="3720.599" dur="4.02">Wednesday</text><text start="3721.88" dur="5.56">it&apos;s about who&apos;s tired it&apos;s about who&apos;s</text><text start="3724.619" dur="5.48">busy it&apos;s about who&apos;s upset who did you</text><text start="3727.44" dur="6.0">know if there&apos;s a whole lot of</text><text start="3730.099" dur="5.98">information in the room</text><text start="3733.44" dur="4.2">about this but we don&apos;t teach our</text><text start="3736.079" dur="3.421">children to pay attention to that</text><text start="3737.64" dur="4.919">relational information</text><text start="3739.5" dur="5.16">we teach them that Wednesday is the day</text><text start="3742.559" dur="5.101">that they do the dishes</text><text start="3744.66" dur="6.06">and that is an obscuring now that</text><text start="3747.66" dur="4.86">teaching is not easily produced this was</text><text start="3750.72" dur="5.22">something my dad did with me all the</text><text start="3752.52" dur="5.7">time where he would articulate okay so</text><text start="3755.94" dur="4.74">I&apos;m making this decision because I&apos;m</text><text start="3758.22" dur="4.5">looking at these relationships</text><text start="3760.68" dur="4.28">and so because I&apos;m looking at these</text><text start="3762.72" dur="5.639">relationships I think</text><text start="3764.96" dur="6.52">or I&apos;m learning about but he did a lot</text><text start="3768.359" dur="5.94">of actually vocalizing for me what he</text><text start="3771.48" dur="7.02">was learning the way he was seeing the</text><text start="3774.299" dur="6.961">way he was putting together his response</text><text start="3778.5" dur="6.619">and that takes time</text><text start="3781.26" dur="3.859">it also takes mutual respect</text><text start="3788.16" dur="3.12">yeah it&apos;s interesting the</text><text start="3790.38" dur="3.78">um</text><text start="3791.28" dur="4.559">the structured rule set obviously isn&apos;t</text><text start="3794.16" dur="4.26">teaching them how to assess the</text><text start="3795.839" dur="5.041">environment and to take responsibility</text><text start="3798.42" dur="3.24">and to communicate and</text><text start="3800.88" dur="2.34">um</text><text start="3801.66" dur="2.52">but I&apos;m going to argue for it for a</text><text start="3803.22" dur="3.079">moment</text><text start="3804.18" dur="2.119">um</text><text start="3806.819" dur="2.721">the</text><text start="3810.119" dur="4.921">it&apos;s a relationship between</text><text start="3813.599" dur="3.841">um</text><text start="3815.04" dur="4.38">virtue ethics utilitarian ethics and</text><text start="3817.44" dur="4.1">deontological ethics in terms of the</text><text start="3819.42" dur="4.32">philosophical way to think of it</text><text start="3821.54" dur="4.72">and I never</text><text start="3823.74" dur="4.5">could make a good argument for</text><text start="3826.26" dur="3.839">deontological ethics I.E rule-based</text><text start="3828.24" dur="3.599">systems with the best choices based on</text><text start="3830.099" dur="3.24">kind of rule-based systems it just that</text><text start="3831.839" dur="2.881">seemed like what you do if you assume</text><text start="3833.339" dur="3.78">that everyone is too dumb to figure [ __ ]</text><text start="3834.72" dur="4.619">out for themselves and otherwise you</text><text start="3837.119" dur="3.96">want to balance between virtue and</text><text start="3839.339" dur="3.541">utilitarian ethics virtue ethics being</text><text start="3841.079" dur="3.54">what is intrinsically right regardless</text><text start="3842.88" dur="3.479">of what&apos;s going to come from it and</text><text start="3844.619" dur="2.7">utilitarian ethics saying well let&apos;s</text><text start="3846.359" dur="2.22">think through what&apos;s going to come from</text><text start="3847.319" dur="3.121">it and try to make sure we&apos;re thinking</text><text start="3848.579" dur="3.181">through cause and effect well and of</text><text start="3850.44" dur="3.6">course we can&apos;t think through it</text><text start="3851.76" dur="3.539">perfectly so we have to also Factor what</text><text start="3854.04" dur="3.36">just seems intrinsically right and</text><text start="3855.299" dur="3.421">balance though so I was always down with</text><text start="3857.4" dur="5.04">a balance of virtue ethics and</text><text start="3858.72" dur="6.119">utilitarian ethics the the argument for</text><text start="3862.44" dur="3.72">deontological ethics and the Jews</text><text start="3864.839" dur="4.141">actually make this argument quite well</text><text start="3866.16" dur="5.699">in the kind of talmudic tradition is</text><text start="3868.98" dur="6.24">the system that you&apos;re describing</text><text start="3871.859" dur="5.401">of where your dad explained his choice</text><text start="3875.22" dur="4.139">making process out loud so you were</text><text start="3877.26" dur="5.579">getting to get all of the nuance and</text><text start="3879.359" dur="6.24">context works at small scale</text><text start="3882.839" dur="5.301">and works for people who got that level</text><text start="3885.599" dur="5.401">of development and</text><text start="3888.14" dur="5.38">evolutionarily humans in the same way I</text><text start="3891.0" dur="5.819">said like right in the current context</text><text start="3893.52" dur="5.4">the default setting is nuclear families</text><text start="3896.819" dur="5.28">um before the plow the default setting</text><text start="3898.92" dur="4.5">was a sub Dunbar number tribe right and</text><text start="3902.099" dur="2.821">it would never get bigger than the</text><text start="3903.42" dur="3.0">Dunbar number which was so fascinating</text><text start="3904.92" dur="4.32">right that as soon as it would get</text><text start="3906.42" dur="4.56">roughly bigger than give or take 150 it</text><text start="3909.24" dur="3.78">would always cleave and so there was</text><text start="3910.98" dur="5.04">similarly something that made that the</text><text start="3913.02" dur="5.279">stable State and a huge part of it was</text><text start="3916.02" dur="5.42">as soon as it gets bigger than that you</text><text start="3918.299" dur="5.701">can&apos;t actually have a</text><text start="3921.44" dur="4.72">single conversation that everyone can</text><text start="3924.0" dur="4.26">participate in both because without</text><text start="3926.16"

track that many people</text><text start="3932.46" dur="4.8">to say is everyone pulling their share</text><text start="3934.5" dur="4.38">and whether you can with 40 people and</text><text start="3937.26" dur="3.599">you just literally can&apos;t take enough</text><text start="3938.88" dur="3.54">time to hear everybody&apos;s views back and</text><text start="3940.859" dur="3.181">forth with a thousand people to decide</text><text start="3942.42" dur="3.84">what to do timely enough to decide what</text><text start="3944.04" dur="3.24">to do so if you got larger than that</text><text start="3946.26" dur="3.42">number</text><text start="3947.28" dur="4.26">some people had to have their life</text><text start="3949.68" dur="3.3">subject to the choices that other people</text><text

dur="3.18">rather go be part of a smaller group</text><text start="3955.74" dur="3.66">where I get to say anything so it&apos;s so</text><text start="3957.42" dur="5.04">interesting and then we only started to</text><text start="3959.4" dur="5.58">get larger groups when</text><text start="3962.46" dur="4.68">you we had populated so much that tribal</text><text start="3964.98" dur="4.02">Warfare started to become ubiquitous and</text><text start="3967.14" dur="4.86">in the presence of things like tribal</text><text start="3969.0" dur="5.7">Warfare uh if another larger group is</text><text

will</text><text start="3978.54" dur="4.319">unify for survival purposes in which</text><text start="3981.119" dur="3.661">case will sacrifice some of that</text><text start="3982.859" dur="5.521">autonomy and freedom for security which</text><text start="3984.78" dur="6.779">we can see has been a trend since but in</text><text start="3988.38" dur="7.76">very very large systems

start="4010.579" dur="4.141">into categories and we make rules and so</text><text start="4012.74" dur="4.02">the rule-based system is the idea that</text><text start="4014.72" dur="5.339">you have people like judges and people</text><text start="4016.76" dur="5.52">like Specialists who are way way more</text><text start="4020.059" dur="3.601">uh spending all their life thinking</text><text

Insight is and you could say</text><text start="4509.48" dur="2.699">well they only got that opportunity</text><text start="4510.8" dur="2.82">because they already had proclivity but</text><text start="4512.179" dur="3.421">that isn&apos;t actually kind of what happens</text><text start="4513.62" dur="3.24">it&apos;s that accidentally they got into</text><text start="4515.6" dur="3.84">this

what&apos;s so</text><text start="4550.219" dur="3.181">interesting is even when you come up to</text><text start="4551.6" dur="4.619">the Feynman topic</text><text start="4553.4" dur="5.52">Von

it</text><text start="4973.46" dur="5.64">but we try just not to see it</text><text start="4976.04" dur="5.82">and the other question is</text><text start="4979.1" dur="4.98">um the road ahead as you described it is</text><text start="4981.86" dur="5.299">very dystopical</text><text start="4984.08" dur="6.96">um and now we&apos;re talking more about a</text><text start="4987.159" dur="8.741">procedural way how to attack the problem</text><text start="4991.04" dur="8.699">and as being theoretical do we see a</text><text start="4995.9" dur="7.08">vision of what could be or how

start="5020.739" dur="3.061">some point on the in the discussion</text><text start="5022.12" dur="3.78">about education you talk you talked</text><text start="5023.8" dur="4.5">about how we can&apos;t

dur="6.06">hello I have a question you talk about</text><text start="5044.8" dur="5.54">that we lack the wisdom of Gods</text><text start="5047.62" dur="7.14">but we have this great

dur="2.42">right direction</text><text start="5062.86" dur="4.379">yeah so it seemed like uh a thing that</text><text start="5065.5" dur="4.26">you both touched upon was paying</text><text start="5067.239" dur="3.721">attention uh and then that seems to be</text><text start="5069.76" dur="3.419">an important thing and occurred to me</text><text start="5070.96" dur="4.199">that one</text><text start="5073.179" dur="3.421">one of our fundamental</text><text start="5075.159" dur="3.681">one of the fundamental things that we do</text><text start="5076.6" dur="5.34">as human

and says that</text><text start="5155.92" dur="7.86">you can&apos;t brush that off you can&apos;t just</text><text start="5159.34" dur="6.06">deliver some canned script</text><text start="5163.78"

dur="4.161">that question you have to show up</text><text start="5178.42" dur="5.94">um with no [ __ ] actually</text><text start="5181.12" dur="5.4">and so</text><text start="5184.36" dur="4.26">you know the only thing I knew to say</text><text start="5186.52" dur="4.5">was</text><text start="5188.62" dur="4.559">keep asking the question</text><text start="5191.02" dur="4.08">keep asking that

like this</text><text start="5257.56" dur="7.02">so for me the the greatest</text><text start="5261.82" dur="6.18">learning happens in these moments when</text><text start="5264.58" dur="7.26">we begin to perceive our own perception</text><text start="5268.0" dur="7.34">and and most of the time that happens in</text><text start="5271.84" dur="3.5">a way that&apos;s a little bit

doesn&apos;t work for me I can&apos;t</text><text start="5628.12" dur="5.64">do that I can&apos;t shut off what I know so</text><text start="5631.179" dur="3.781">I&apos;m like all right

start="5648.159" dur="6.181">not the case so I remember thinking if I</text><text start="5651.46" dur="4.98">die in factory farms haven&apos;t ended then</text><text start="5654.34" dur="3.12">I failed at living in a way that I could</text><text start="5656.44" dur="3.48">be okay with</text><text start="5657.46" dur="5.699">and</text><text start="5659.92" dur="5.759">you know then that just expanded from</text><text start="5663.159" dur="4.621">that to all the other issues and but</text><text start="5665.679" dur="5.221">what</text><text start="5667.78" dur="5.7">it did is say I</text><text start="5670.9" dur="5.16">um I can&apos;t think about my life separate</text><text start="5673.48" dur="6.42">from life separate from the whole of all</text><text start="5676.06" dur="6.78">the things and you know I wasn&apos;t</text><text start="5679.9" dur="5.339">born into extreme poverty in Sudan I</text><text start="5682.84" dur="4.14">wasn&apos;t born with AIDS I

so</text><text start="5700.179" dur="4.441">that feels obligate</text><text start="5702.159" dur="4.141">right but like a</text><text start="5704.62" dur="4.5">like an obligation I wouldn&apos;t want out</text><text start="5706.3" dur="6.06">of like a sacred obligation</text><text start="5709.12" dur="5.76">and um</text><text start="5712.36" dur="4.68">and then the problem comes that I have</text><text start="5714.88" dur="3.779">no idea how to do it and then the</text><text start="5717.04" dur="3.48">problem comes that I get some ideas and</text><text start="5718.659" dur="5.721">they totally don&apos;t work</text><text start="5720.52" dur="6.36">right and so there&apos;s a kind of</text><text start="5724.38" dur="4.359">existential devastation</text><text start="5726.88" dur="4.68">and then if you pull yourself out of</text><text start="5728.739" dur="5.581">that there&apos;s a naive optimism</text><text start="5731.56" dur="5.099">of how to possibly solve the things that</text><text start="5734.32" dur="4.379">will totally not work right the early</text><text start="5736.659" dur="5.641">activist ideas I had of course got</text><text

the solutions I had</text><text start="5746.86" dur="2.94">in mind</text><text start="5747.88" dur="4.08">didn&apos;t factor a million of the causal</text><text start="5749.8" dur="3.24">Dynamics involved and</text><text start="5751.96" dur="3.679">um</text><text start="5753.04" dur="5.88">and so then back to existential angst</text><text start="5755.639" dur="5.741">Devastation but then the only answer is</text><text start="5758.92" dur="4.86">understand the problem better</text><text start="5761.38" dur="4.44">to know how to contribute to what might</text><text start="5763.78" dur="5.24">be adequate Solutions better</text><text start="5765.82" dur="3.2">and um</text><text start="5769.06" dur="5.46">and I remember being like okay so the</text><text start="5772.659"

start="5802.659" dur="3.721">I&apos;m like all right I&apos;ve got to dwell in</text><text start="5805.179" dur="3.48">the forest</text><text start="5806.38" dur="4.68">and only gather things that I

dur="3.901">can&apos;t change the systems at all that way</text><text start="5815.679" dur="3.661">and so then there was this recognition</text><text start="5817.6" dur="4.139">that</text><text

a gaussian distribution of</text><text start="6293.58" dur="4.619">Truth and I can cherry pick them and by</text><text start="6295.52" dur="5.08">decontextualizing them oh the average</text><text

with</text><text start="6320.76" dur="6.479">rigorous facts and so this is basically</text><text start="6323.94" dur="6.66">how mainstream journals lie</text><text start="6327.239" dur="4.681">um and or you know mislead and you&apos;re</text><text start="6330.6" dur="3.48">talking about justification there&apos;s</text><text start="6331.92" dur="5.4">almost like there&apos;s a</text><text start="6334.08" dur="5.4">the dominant Narrative of a culture is</text><text start="6337.32" dur="5.52">the apologism for the power structure of</text><text start="6339.48" dur="6.719">the culture it kind of has to be right</text><text start="6342.84" dur="5.22">and so of course if you look at the like</text><text start="6346.199" dur="4.381">you look at the way that somebody like</text><text start="6348.06" dur="4.92">the Gates Foundation upregulates Hans</text><text start="6350.58" dur="3.599">rossling and Stephen Pinker because if</text><text start="6352.98" dur="3.48">you made a lot of

to</text><text start="6363.9" dur="2.819">support their power system and say why</text><text start="6365.52" dur="2.76">their power system is good they&apos;ll</text><text start="6366.719" dur="3.661">upregulate those thinkers so we wrote</text><text start="6368.28" dur="4.5">another paper called the where arguments</text><text start="6370.38" dur="4.319">come from and it&apos;s basically</text><text start="6372.78" dur="4.08">the arguments that start to proliferate</text><text start="6374.699" dur="4.561">don&apos;t proliferate for no reason and they</text><text start="6376.86" dur="4.02">don&apos;t proliferate just based on what is</text><text start="6379.26" dur="3.419">objectively true they proliferate</text><text start="6380.88" dur="3.239">because someone funded that research and</text><text start="6382.679" dur="3.48">then someone funded spreading it because</text><text start="6384.119" dur="3.361">it supports and someone funded it who</text><text start="6386.159" dur="3.06">has the resources to fund it because it</text><text start="6387.48" dur="2.58">supports whatever that dominant system</text><text start="6389.219" dur="3.42">is</text><text start="6390.06" dur="5.52">so yeah the earnestness to want to know</text><text start="6392.639" dur="5.401">what is actually true and not just true</text><text start="6395.58" dur="3.78">but representative right because I can</text><text start="6398.04" dur="3.179">have a truth on one side of a</text><text start="6399.36" dur="4.08">cherry-picked argument</text><text start="6401.219" dur="5.341">um it&apos;s</text><text start="6403.44" dur="5.34">the process of wanting Tobias correct I</text><text start="6406.56" dur="4.2">think and trying to deepen earnestness</text><text start="6408.78" dur="3.78">is really critical</text><text start="6410.76" dur="3.899">so that&apos;s what you&apos;re mentioning on</text><text start="6412.56" dur="4.679">justify this is totally unrelated but</text><text start="6414.659" dur="3.96">there was one thing that I didn&apos;t say to</text><text start="6417.239" dur="2.701">your thing that I wanted to say because</text><text start="6418.619" dur="3.801">I think it&apos;s more important than what I</text><text start="6419.94" dur="2.48">said so far</text><text start="6423.179" dur="3.841">there&apos;s a famous saying in activism that</text><text start="6425.639" dur="2.221">if you aren&apos;t outraged you aren&apos;t paying</text><text start="6427.02" dur="3.119">attention</text><text start="6427.86" dur="4.56">and that was like from the 60s or 70s</text><text start="6430.139" dur="3.841">but obviously now with catastrophic risk</text><text start="6432.42" dur="2.699">you know people can say more like if you</text><text start="6433.98" dur="2.52">aren&apos;t freaked the [ __ ] out you aren&apos;t</text><text start="6435.119" dur="4.62">paying attention</text><text start="6436.5" dur="6.54">but of course like Rumi or hafez would</text><text start="6439.739" dur="4.321">say if you aren&apos;t in utter awe at the</text><text start="6443.04" dur="2.22">beauty of reality aren&apos;t paying</text><text start="6444.06" dur="2.639">attention</text><text start="6445.26" dur="3.6">and that&apos;s</text><text start="6446.699" dur="4.44">true and</text><text start="6448.86" dur="4.02">it it&apos;s the truth of that that makes the</text><text start="6451.139" dur="4.741">other one what it is</text><text start="6452.88" dur="5.1">because if reality was not</text><text start="6455.88" dur="3.42">beautiful it wasn&apos;t magnificent I</text><text start="6457.98" dur="3.659">wouldn&apos;t give a [ __ ] about if it&apos;s going</text><text start="6459.3" dur="5.399">to burn down</text><text start="6461.639" dur="5.881">and so if I don&apos;t connect to the awe at</text><text start="6464.699" dur="5.04">the beauty of it enough my outrage or</text><text start="6467.52" dur="4.44">whatever will actually mislead me</text><text start="6469.739" dur="3.721">you know and so there&apos;s an interesting</text><text start="6471.96" dur="5.4">thing like</text><text start="6473.46" dur="5.759">am I people will ask</text><text start="6477.36" dur="4.08">um you know how do I process all the</text><text start="6479.219" dur="5.121">stuff in my optimistic pessimistic I</text><text start="6481.44" dur="2.9">absolutely see</text><text start="6485.34" dur="3.96">um</text><text

start="6498.3" dur="3.839">desirable and doable world</text><text start="6500.46" dur="4.679">so I do not think that we have</text><text start="6502.139" dur="6.06">fundamental impossibility issues</text><text start="6505.139" dur="5.161">that by no means means we will figure it</text><text start="6508.199" dur="3.781">out right</text><text start="6510.3" dur="4.5">but my</text><text start="6511.98" dur="5.34">my motivation is not because I believe</text><text start="6514.8" dur="6.0">we will like it&apos;s actually not from some</text><text start="6517.32" dur="6.299">optimism

is one thing</text><text start="6550.199" dur="4.321">I think being awed by the beauty of life</text><text start="6552.6" dur="3.42">is the next thing and then realizing</text><text start="6554.52"

start="6774.36" dur="4.92">and</text><text start="6777.06" dur="3.119">but I mostly want people working in the</text><text start="6779.28" dur="3.839">space</text><text start="6780.179" dur="5.46">who just I&apos;ll tell a story I have a</text><text start="6783.119" dur="5.761">friend who is very good in catastrophic</text><text start="6785.639" dur="5.641">risk work and who is uh</text><text

pointed something out to him that</text><text start="6799.5" dur="6.92">if someone shares with him</text><text start="6802.86" dur="5.64">a new risk that they come up with the</text><text

starts to</text><text start="6816.239" dur="3.42">think about all the second third order</text><text start="6817.86" dur="5.1">effects and how that will accelerate</text><text start="6819.659" dur="5.04">collapse and he and he buys it and if</text><text start="6822.96" dur="3.779">someone tells him a possible solution to</text><text start="6824.699" dur="4.381">one of them instantly his mind looks for</text><text start="6826.739" dur="4.021">why it&apos;s wrong</text><text start="6829.08" dur="3.72">but his mind doesn&apos;t look for why the</text><text start="6830.76" dur="4.68">catastrophe might not happen</text><text start="6832.8" dur="4.919">and so there is a which is why he&apos;s good</text><text start="6835.44" dur="4.02">at that thing but also imbalanced right</text><text start="6837.719" dur="4.261">and I&apos;m like no I want you to do both</text><text start="6839.46" dur="4.92">like I want you to look for why the</text><text start="6841.98" dur="3.239">catastrophic forecast might be wrong but</text><text start="6844.38" dur="2.88">I</text><text start="6845.219" dur="3.48">and right and I want you to look at why</text><text start="6847.26" dur="3.359">the solution might be wrong and and</text><text start="6848.699" dur="3.42">right but you have a an uneven</text><text start="6850.619" dur="3.421">distribution so I said we&apos;re going to do</text><text start="6852.119" dur="3.241">a strategy meeting but I&apos;m going to put</text><text start="6854.04" dur="2.639">you on MDMA</text><text start="6855.36" dur="3.299">first</text><text start="6856.679" dur="3.841">because I want you to see that a part of</text><text start="6858.659" dur="3.721">your epistemology is just the result of</text><text start="6860.52" dur="3.36">your own state that was conditioned in</text><text start="6862.38" dur="3.359">childhood for some reasons I didn&apos;t know</text><text start="6863.88" dur="4.259">about him but I&apos;m like I want to put you</text><text start="6865.739" dur="7.041">in a state where you feel because what</text><text start="6868.139" dur="7.5">happens is only when the story</text><text start="6872.78" dur="4.3">says dread is coming does it feel true</text><text start="6875.639" dur="3.841">for him because of the dread that is</text><text start="6877.08" dur="4.079">carried inside probably because you know</text><text start="6879.48" dur="3.0">whenever Dad walked in it felt like</text><text start="6881.159" dur="3.301">Dread and that&apos;s still embedded or</text><text start="6882.48" dur="3.54">something like that and I&apos;m like when</text><text start="6884.46" dur="3.84">you&apos;re in a totally different state What</text><text start="6886.02" dur="4.26">lands as true because ultimately we&apos;re</text><text start="6888.3" dur="3.78">less logically formal than we think</text><text start="6890.28" dur="3.439">there&apos;s like a felt sense of truthiness</text><text start="6892.08" dur="5.76">that&apos;s a big part of our epistemology</text><text start="6893.719" dur="5.381">and so put them on ecstasy he&apos;s rolling</text><text start="6897.84" dur="3.24">and happy and then I&apos;m walking through</text><text start="6899.1" dur="4.38">catastrophic risks and solutions and he</text><text start="6901.08" dur="4.38">was doing completely different logic</text><text start="6903.48" dur="3.659">and I had to point out something he&apos;s</text><text start="6905.46" dur="3.54">doing completely different logic and so</text><text start="6907.139" dur="3.781">of course I want</text><text start="6909.0" dur="3.9">I want people to try to notice their</text><text start="6910.92" dur="3.239">biases and correct them think through</text><text start="6912.9" dur="2.819">the same thing from a lot of different</text><text start="6914.159" dur="2.881">epistemologies in a lot of different</text><text start="6915.719" dur="3.181">states and a lot of different</text><text start="6917.04" dur="6.56">perspectives</text><text start="6918.9" dur="4.7">um But ultimately it&apos;s not</text><text start="6923.82" dur="3.72">some kind of negativity or catastrophic</text><text start="6925.739" dur="2.821">or pessimistic bias that has me focus on</text><text start="6927.54" dur="3.72">this it&apos;s</text><text start="6928.56" dur="4.74">uh the love of life that wants to</text><text start="6931.26" dur="3.78">protect it so wants to understand what</text><text start="6933.3" dur="3.12">to protect and how to be effective at</text><text start="6935.04" dur="3.119">that</text><text start="6936.42" dur="3.48">um but there&apos;s like yeah it&apos;s actually</text><text start="6938.159" dur="3.0">an affirmation of beauty that is at the</text><text start="6939.9" dur="2.7">source of it so</text><text start="6941.159" dur="3.721">thought I&apos;d say that</text><text start="6942.6" dur="3.9">I I&apos;m coming back to this attention</text><text start="6944.88" dur="4.319">question</text><text start="6946.5" dur="6.179">um because I I you know</text><text start="6949.199" dur="5.94">the Doom porn Okay so so there&apos;s lots of</text><text start="6952.679" dur="4.201">people who talk about the way that we</text><text start="6955.139" dur="4.741">have been talking about the meta crisis</text><text start="6956.88" dur="5.52">as this kind of super exciting Doom porn</text><text start="6959.88" dur="5.16">and the more you talk about it like the</text><text start="6962.4" dur="6.18">kind of more like oh it gets it&apos;s like</text><text start="6965.04" dur="5.46">you know and it can get addictive</text><text start="6968.58" dur="4.86">um</text><text start="6970.5" dur="5.4">but you know I remember</text><text start="6973.44" dur="4.92">whatever it was when I was a kid growing</text><text start="6975.9" dur="5.4">up we were having conversations at the</text><text start="6978.36" dur="4.92">dinner table that were not so dissimilar</text><text start="6981.3" dur="3.24">to the one we&apos;re having tonight what are</text><text start="6983.28" dur="4.2">we going to do Etc I mean these</text><text start="6984.54" dur="5.06">conversations are not new</text><text start="6987.48" dur="2.12">um</text><text start="6990.9" dur="4.98">and there was the sense that oh if we</text><text start="6993.06" dur="4.559">could just get people afraid they would</text><text start="6995.88" dur="3.54">respond</text><text start="6997.619" dur="4.381">they would we did a good job at that</text><text start="6999.42" dur="5.4">yeah and it didn&apos;t do anything</text><text start="7002.0" dur="4.44">well no they did what well hold on let</text><text start="7004.82" dur="5.58">me finish so</text><text start="7006.44" dur="5.219">the the idea being that the opposite of</text><text start="7010.4" dur="3.42">the numbness</text><text start="7011.659" dur="3.601">would be fear and pain if they could</text><text start="7013.82" dur="3.419">feel the pain or they could feel the</text><text start="7015.26" dur="5.04">fear they would respond</text><text start="7017.239" dur="4.801">but I what I&apos;m hoping you&apos;re hearing is</text><text start="7020.3" dur="4.08">that in in fact the opposite of that</text><text start="7022.04" dur="5.52">numbness is sensitivity</text><text start="7024.38" dur="6.06">and the sensitivity is got to be more</text><text start="7027.56" dur="6.539">dimensional than fear and pain it must</text><text start="7030.44" dur="6.299">include Beauty and curiosity it has to</text><text start="7034.099" dur="5.1">include remorse and it has to include</text><text start="7036.739" dur="4.141">humor it has to include lots of</text><text start="7039.199" dur="4.761">different textures</text><text start="7040.88" dur="5.7">of sensitivity lots of flavors of ideas</text><text start="7043.96" dur="6.159">lots of kinds of relationships to</text><text start="7046.58" dur="6.0">explore all of those in and that is what</text><text start="7050.119" dur="3.661">allows for a kind of ecology of</text><text start="7052.58" dur="4.079">sensitivity</text><text start="7053.78" dur="4.439">that that I think is that attention that</text><text start="7056.659" dur="3.06">you&apos;re speaking to that&apos;s really</text><text start="7058.219" dur="3.801">important</text><text start="7059.719" dur="2.301">um so</text><text start="7063.5" dur="5.099">I think it it&apos;s innate it is there</text><text start="7067.04" dur="7.079">it is there</text><text start="7068.599" dur="8.461">but it can get grooved in to various</text><text start="7074.119" dur="5.1">um habits scripts tones</text><text start="7077.06" dur="4.619">of what&apos;s the tone of the environmental</text><text start="7079.219" dur="4.141">movement yeah you know what the tone of</text><text start="7081.679" dur="4.02">the environmental movement is</text><text start="7083.36" dur="6.9">right there&apos;s a tone what&apos;s the tone of</text><text start="7085.699" dur="7.92">the gender activist space there&apos;s a tone</text><text start="7090.26" dur="5.7">and to to expand those tonalities into</text><text start="7093.619" dur="5.461">much more multi-tonal</text><text start="7095.96" dur="5.04">spaces is I think part of increasing</text><text start="7099.08" dur="3.96">that sensitivity</text><text start="7101.0" dur="5.76">if you drive</text><text start="7103.04" dur="5.34">fear or anger uh</text><text start="7106.76" dur="3.54">few things can happen one is you can</text><text start="7108.38" dur="3.66">desensitize people right and everybody</text><text start="7110.3" dur="3.06">just goes numb</text><text start="7112.04" dur="4.8">and</text><text start="7113.36" dur="4.14">the other thing that you do is</text><text start="7116.84" dur="2.339">um</text><text start="7117.5" dur="4.08">Drive War</text><text start="7119.179" dur="4.401">and drive</text><text start="7121.58" dur="2.0">um</text><text start="7125.3" dur="5.819">scared radical actions</text><text start="7128.119" dur="5.161">and so one of the things that I want</text><text start="7131.119" dur="4.761">people to think about the most is in</text><text start="7133.28" dur="6.0">whatever project you&apos;re campaigning for</text><text start="7135.88" dur="5.02">you communicate about it in a way that</text><text start="7139.28" dur="4.14">you think will appeal to a particular</text><text start="7140.9" dur="4.92">demographic to make sure we really stop</text><text start="7143.42" dur="4.08">spraying the neonicotinoid pesticides or</text><text start="7145.82" dur="3.419">deal with the climate change thing or</text><text start="7147.5" dur="3.96">deal with the abortion rights thing or</text><text start="7149.239" dur="4.38">whatever the thing is</text><text start="7151.46" dur="4.679">but if you don&apos;t think enough about how</text><text start="7153.619" dur="4.441">that communication will affect the</text><text start="7156.139" dur="5.1">people who don&apos;t agree and what the</text><text start="7158.06" dur="6.119">blowback of that will be then you&apos;re</text><text start="7161.239" dur="4.741">producing not just the immediate</text><text start="7164.179" dur="2.94">movement forward of coalescing those who</text><text start="7165.98" dur="2.639">are going to respond you&apos;re also</text><text start="7167.119" dur="3.301">producing</text><text start="7168.619" dur="4.261">blowback of other people who are not</text><text start="7170.42" dur="4.5">inert right who are political actors who</text><text start="7172.88" dur="3.18">disagree who feel scared who feel what</text><text start="7174.92" dur="3.36">you&apos;re doing is endangering something</text><text start="7176.06" dur="5.039">that they care about and then they</text><text start="7178.28" dur="5.16">employ some more powerful Technologies</text><text start="7181.099" dur="4.741">and so then you just drive an arms race</text><text start="7183.44" dur="3.9">and the arms race ends up having more</text><text start="7185.84" dur="3.6">consequence than the issue itself did</text><text start="7187.34" dur="4.14">right the degree of polarization the</text><text start="7189.44" dur="4.08">break of the social contract the break</text><text

dur="4.079">so this idea of I&apos;m just going to say</text><text start="7293.9" dur="3.96">what I think and I&apos;m not responsible for</text><text start="7295.639" dur="3.96">the way it makes you

that</text><text start="7306.08" dur="4.68">there is this not only first order of</text><text start="7309.02" dur="3.0">I&apos;m going to teach my kid to do the</text><text start="7310.76"

there&apos;s a dialectic and it&apos;s very</text><text start="7371.36" dur="4.2">easy to</text><text start="7373.099" dur="5.401">polarize that dialectic rather than</text><text start="7375.56" dur="5.46">synthesize it right to say because one</text><text start="7378.5" dur="3.84">side expressed in extreme sounds so</text><text start="7381.02" dur="4.079">ridiculous I&apos;m going to take the Other</text><text start="7382.34" dur="4.319">Extreme yeah as opposed to there is a</text><text start="7385.099" dur="3.841">partial truth in each side of this</text><text start="7386.659" dur="4.261">dialectic so</text><text start="7388.94" dur="4.199">um should I not say anything that</text><text start="7390.92" dur="3.96">bothers anyone no</text><text start="7393.139" dur="3.361">do I care about the effect that I have</text><text start="7394.88" dur="3.06">on other people and do I not want to</text><text start="7396.5" dur="3.54">have an effect that might Harden them</text><text start="7397.94" dur="5.1">into their positions further that&apos;s also</text><text start="7400.04" dur="5.099">true right so one very simple principle</text><text start="7403.04" dur="4.559">I would say is</text><text start="7405.139" dur="3.721">any value that you care about look at</text><text start="7407.599" dur="3.54">the opposing value</text><text start="7408.86" dur="3.839">right Ecclesiastes There&apos;s A Time to</text><text start="7411.139" dur="3.54">Kill and it&apos;s time to heal and to sow</text><text start="7412.699" dur="4.141">and to reap well how do you know what</text><text start="7414.679" dur="5.221">time it is there&apos;s a there&apos;s a</text><text start="7416.84" dur="4.92">discernment that is a there&apos;s a presence</text><text start="7419.9"

dialectic</text><text start="7426.8" dur="5.76">so if you take whatever your belief on a</text><text start="7429.44" dur="4.679">topic is as the thesis then say who is</text><text start="7432.56" dur="3.599">who are the smartest people I can find</text><text start="7434.119" dur="3.961">who really disagree with me on this find</text><text start="7436.159" dur="4.141">the anti-thesis see if you can</text><text start="7438.08" dur="3.84">understand their reasoning really deeply</text><text start="7440.3" dur="3.56">deeply enough that you can express it</text><text start="7441.92" dur="4.02">and they don&apos;t need to correct you</text><text start="7443.86" dur="4.06">and then</text><text start="7445.94" dur="3.659">see how it changes your position and if</text><text start="7447.92" dur="3.48">there is a synthesis that is a higher</text><text start="7449.599" dur="4.321">order Insight that contains elements of</text><text start="7451.4" dur="3.779">both of those

find the synthesis it&apos;s</text><text start="7472.88" dur="5.839">amazing how something that simple can</text><text start="7475.58" dur="3.139">guide so much</text><text start="7478.94" dur="6.14">and sometimes the thing you&apos;re looking</text><text start="7481.4" dur="3.68">for is in another context</text><text start="7485.3" dur="5.64">um I I have found so often that I&apos;m just</text><text start="7488.96" dur="5.04">asking the wrong question</text><text start="7490.94" dur="5.219">and that when there is a polarity like</text><text start="7494.0" dur="5.34">that that if you ask a question that&apos;s</text><text start="7496.159" dur="4.801">in another context the polarity undoes</text><text start="7499.34" dur="4.14">itself yeah</text><text start="7500.96" dur="3.96">um most of the time in order to really</text><text start="7503.48" dur="5.52">hold</text><text start="7504.92" dur="6.719">a polarity it requires a reductionism it</text><text start="7509.0" dur="6.36">requires a decontextualization the more</text><text start="7511.639" dur="6.241">context you add the more that polarity</text><text start="7515.36" dur="4.56">is going to dissolve</text><text start="7517.88" dur="4.739">um and and then it becomes oh well what</text><text start="7519.92" dur="5.64">question actually were we working on</text><text start="7522.619" dur="5.641">so it can be a real distraction to think</text><text start="7525.56" dur="5.579">you know if the question is how am I</text><text start="7528.26" dur="5.939">going to get my kid through fifth grade</text><text start="7531.139" dur="6.48">I have to get them to be you know get</text><text start="7534.199" dur="6.241">good grades and be a good good kid</text><text start="7537.619" dur="5.821">uh that&apos;s a very different question than</text><text start="7540.44" dur="5.94">how am I going to support my kid to</text><text start="7543.44" dur="6.12">figure out how to be in a world that&apos;s</text><text start="7546.38" dur="5.819">really difficult right now</text><text start="7549.56" dur="3.96">and the two are probably the same</text><text start="7552.199" dur="3.42">question</text><text start="7553.52" dur="4.02">probably one of the reasons your fifth</text><text start="7555.619" dur="3.901">grader is struggling is because they&apos;re</text><text start="7557.54" dur="5.04">struggling with things that are floating</text><text start="7559.52" dur="5.52">around in the in the sphere</text><text start="7562.58" dur="5.94">of shared information in the common</text><text start="7565.04" dur="6.78">sense if you know beginning to</text><text start="7568.52" dur="6.119">show your kids that you are an advocate</text><text start="7571.82" dur="6.18">for them that together we&apos;re gonna walk</text><text start="7574.639" dur="5.46">into this unknown future</text><text start="7578.0" dur="4.639">makes it a lot easier to sit through</text><text start="7580.099" dur="2.54">fifth grade</text><text start="7583.099" dur="4.921">and what you said just reminded me of a</text><text start="7585.86" dur="3.96">couple things</text><text start="7588.02" dur="3.599">um that my</text><text start="7589.82" dur="4.2">parents did that I think are really cool</text><text start="7591.619" dur="6.0">that they held as like important</text><text start="7594.02" dur="5.699">principles of parenting teaching one was</text><text start="7597.619" dur="4.201">um my dad was really into asking kids</text><text start="7599.719" dur="3.9">what do you think happens to</text><text start="7601.82" dur="4.08">Consciousness after death</text><text start="7603.619" dur="5.1">and questions around Free Will and</text><text

start="7617.599" dur="3.721">because it&apos;s not a topic that we have</text><text start="7618.92" dur="4.199">good epistemic basis to know so we get</text><text start="7621.32" dur="3.12">to have we get to come into Symmetry and</text><text start="7623.119" dur="2.461">have a conversation where I have reason</text><text start="7624.44" dur="2.82">to be interested in what they think</text><text

insight to try to find context in</text><text start="7632.239" dur="4.741">which you can be in symmetry and I</text><text start="7634.28" dur="5.16">thought another one of the ones was</text><text start="7636.98" dur="4.259">he said that there were so few times</text><text start="7639.44" dur="2.94">that the adult was interacting with the</text><text start="7641.239" dur="2.701">kid where the adult didn&apos;t have an</text><text start="7642.38" dur="4.799">agenda for the kid and the kid could</text><text start="7643.94" dur="4.62">feel that they want me to do my chores</text><text

where</text><text start="7653.599" dur="4.14">you just come and interact and find out</text><text start="7655.699" dur="5.701">what they&apos;re interested in and follow</text><text start="7657.739" dur="6.121">that and how profound an experienced it</text><text start="7661.4" dur="4.739">is when a kid has someone there that is</text><text start="7663.86" dur="4.58">seeking to facilitate them but not with</text><text start="7666.139" dur="2.301">a Direction</text><text start="7668.719" dur="3.621">I love that I think my dad was really</text><text start="7670.82" dur="6.48">curious</text><text

dur="2.28">and</text><text start="7687.92" dur="3.9">um</text><text start="7688.82" dur="5.96">so he was always seeking various</text><text start="7691.82" dur="5.819">experiences and possible
