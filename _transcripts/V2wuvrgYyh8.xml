dur="4.451">speak to me I know it&apos;s really late over</text><text start="9.96" dur="4.71">there and we&apos;re going to do a follow-up</text><text start="11.88" dur="5.489">to we did a situational assessment a</text><text start="14.67" dur="4.47">little while ago about Co vid where</text><text start="17.369" dur="3.391">we&apos;re at what the sort of second and</text><text start="19.14" dur="3.69">third order effects might be that we&apos;re</text><text start="20.76" dur="3.54">seeing and just to introduce you briefly</text><text start="22.83" dur="3.42">to people who maybe are not familiar</text><text start="24.3" dur="4.2">with you you&apos;ve been on the channel</text><text start="26.25" dur="4.92">quite a bit with films like the war on</text><text start="28.5" dur="5.18">sense-making you&apos;re really interested</text><text start="31.17" dur="4.5">and spend a long time studying</text><text start="33.68" dur="6.34">catastrophic risk and sort of</text><text start="35.67" dur="6.209">civilization design and I&apos;d love to hear</text><text start="40.02" dur="5.789">from you like where do you think we&apos;re</text><text start="41.879" dur="7.351">at right now so probably a lot of the</text><text start="45.809" dur="4.441">viewers here have heard the term the</text><text start="49.23" dur="3.63">hammer and dance</text><text start="50.25" dur="4.32">I think poyo kind of popularized I don&apos;t</text><text start="52.86" dur="4.769">know if he came up with it and that</text><text start="54.57" dur="4.919">there is an approach that most countries</text><text start="57.629" dur="4.95">have taken of some kind of strong</text><text start="59.489" dur="5.041">quarantine for a while to stop the</text><text start="62.579" dur="3.9">transmission and then a release of that</text><text start="64.53" dur="3.81">quarantine but that doesn&apos;t mean back to</text><text start="66.479" dur="3.241">life as normal instantly because they&apos;re</text><text start="68.34" dur="6.18">still going to be infected people and</text><text start="69.72" dur="6.149">then could re start if there wasn&apos;t</text><text start="74.52" dur="4.7">carefulness so there has to be some</text><text start="75.869" dur="7.081">ongoing management it&apos;ll involve some</text><text start="79.22" dur="5.32">social distancing and PPE and testing</text><text start="82.95" dur="2.94">and contact tracing and all these kinds</text><text start="84.54" dur="4.829">of things and some areas that have</text><text start="85.89" dur="5.04">already got the caseload down quite a</text><text start="89.369" dur="3.121">lot and started to open back up did</text><text start="90.93" dur="3.39">start to see up ticks in the number of</text><text start="92.49" dur="3.12">cases again so then you have to kind of</text><text start="94.32" dur="7.439">restrict again and that&apos;s the dance</text><text start="95.61" dur="8.81">right and so most of principles that I</text><text start="101.759" dur="4.741">share will be pretty universal to</text><text start="104.42" dur="3.94">anywhere because it&apos;s universal to</text><text start="106.5" dur="4.259">public health and epidemiology in like</text><text start="108.36" dur="4.079">that but I&apos;ll speak about them in</text><text start="110.759" dur="3.631">context of the United States in</text><text start="112.439" dur="4.381">particular since a lot of viewers are</text><text start="114.39" dur="7.589">there and I know more about there than</text><text start="116.82" dur="9.95">other places being based here so we</text><text start="121.979" dur="7.741">didn&apos;t have nationwide shelter in place</text><text start="126.77" dur="4.75">in a way that some people were concerned</text><text start="129.72" dur="3.06">about and some people really wanted but</text><text start="131.52" dur="2.81">for whatever we didn&apos;t have that we</text><text start="132.78" dur="4.82">Moorhead state based</text><text start="134.33" dur="7.83">approaches and but most of the states</text><text start="137.6" dur="6.39">took some kind of measures to shelter in</text><text start="142.16" dur="3.93">place and only have a central workers</text><text start="143.99" dur="4.14">out and things like that some states</text><text start="146.09" dur="3.95">like California did a lot stronger</text><text start="148.13" dur="5.73">measures earlier than other states and</text><text start="150.04" dur="7.18">resultantly we&apos;re able to have what</text><text start="153.86" dur="4.77">looked like much better curves relative</text><text start="157.22" dur="5.94">to the rest of the other metrics than</text><text start="158.63" dur="6.93">what they could have we&apos;re seeing what</text><text start="163.16" dur="4.74">looks like the beginning of a flattening</text><text start="165.56" dur="3.99">but it&apos;s not long enough to really have</text><text start="167.9" dur="3.36">a clear sense on that and you&apos;re</text><text start="169.55" dur="3.63">supposed to see a flattening as a</text><text start="171.26" dur="6.15">meaning a decrease in the number of new</text><text start="173.18" dur="6.21">cases as a result of those efforts but</text><text start="177.41" dur="4.17">that doesn&apos;t mean that it&apos;s we it&apos;s done</text><text start="179.39" dur="3.75">and you release the efforts and it&apos;s</text><text start="181.58" dur="3.24">gone right it means you release the</text><text start="183.14" dur="3.15">efforts of the your back to the</text><text start="184.82" dur="4.62">situation where it was on an exponential</text><text start="186.29" dur="7.38">curve before and because of the lag time</text><text start="189.44" dur="8.49">and call it two weeks right a couple of</text><text start="193.67" dur="7.289">five-day doubling times or so you really</text><text start="197.93" dur="5.52">have to see it turned down for a little</text><text start="200.959" dur="6.181">while before you actually have a clearer</text><text start="203.45" dur="6.15">sense of what has happened but let&apos;s</text><text start="207.14" dur="4.56">just kind of fast forward a little bit</text><text start="209.6" dur="3.84">and different countries are obviously at</text><text start="211.7" dur="3.44">different places in their curve with</text><text start="213.44" dur="6.75">regard to this and even within the u.s.</text><text start="215.14" dur="6.43">some states got heavy amounts of</text><text start="220.19" dur="4.5">infections much earlier than other</text><text start="221.57" dur="5.82">states and then some of them started</text><text start="224.69" dur="5.549">their shelter-in-place protocols earlier</text><text start="227.39" dur="3.96">and so it&apos;s not a universal curve and</text><text start="230.239" dur="2.851">for that reason it&apos;s actually really</text><text start="231.35" dur="3.33">good for individual cities and</text><text start="233.09" dur="5.19">individual states to be able to think</text><text start="234.68" dur="6.27">about it in a way that is relevant to</text><text start="238.28" dur="5.58">their case at the same time there&apos;s also</text><text start="240.95" dur="4.74">big limits there so let&apos;s say a state</text><text start="243.86" dur="5.159">did a very good job of getting their</text><text start="245.69" dur="5.28">case load down to almost nothing well</text><text start="249.019" dur="5.061">now they other states didn&apos;t they have</text><text start="250.97" dur="5.34">to keep their borders totally closed to</text><text start="254.08" dur="3.49">transport of goods into food into</text><text start="256.31" dur="4.41">whatever otherwise they lose it again</text><text start="257.57" dur="4.71">and so there is a place where whether</text><text start="260.72" dur="3.42">we&apos;re talking from a state by state or a</text><text start="262.28" dur="3.109">county by county or a country by country</text><text start="264.14" dur="5.57">level</text><text start="265.389" dur="6.68">to reopen up the flow of traffic which</text><text start="269.71" dur="5.16">is key for the economy and society</text><text start="272.069" dur="5.921">everybody kind of has to get to a</text><text start="274.87" dur="5.909">similar place so there-there are both</text><text start="277.99" dur="7.109">benefits of regionalism and limits to it</text><text start="280.779" dur="9.331">for a situation like this so with regard</text><text start="285.099" dur="7.32">to looking ahead a little bit and what</text><text start="290.11" dur="4.44">does the path of starting to release the</text><text start="292.419" dur="5.571">shelter in place or quarantine look like</text><text start="294.55" dur="6.72">it will be effective at being able to</text><text start="297.99" dur="4.81">keep suppressing the virus keep that</text><text start="301.27" dur="3.359">from being a public health pandemic</text><text start="302.8" dur="3.03">while being able to allow societal</text><text start="304.629" dur="3.81">function in economy in everything&apos;s</text><text start="305.83" dur="4.049">returned I&apos;ll share some thoughts on</text><text start="308.439" dur="2.76">that some of which are obvious and are</text><text start="309.879" dur="3.75">publicly talked about some of which are</text><text start="311.199" dur="4.59">not as obvious and hopefully in this</text><text start="313.629" dur="5.82">first bit sharing this all together will</text><text start="315.789" dur="8.041">add some clarity this is the day after</text><text start="319.449" dur="5.851">Easter and much of this might change by</text><text start="323.83" dur="3.03">a week from now because it is a</text><text start="325.3" dur="5.97">situation where a lot is still unknown</text><text start="326.86" dur="6.299">and we&apos;re learning a lot quickly and I</text><text start="331.27" dur="7.23">might be wrong about some things so take</text><text start="333.159" dur="8.361">it all with a grain of salt so the first</text><text start="338.5" dur="5.339">thing is when do we actually start</text><text start="341.52" dur="4.389">releasing the quarantine measures</text><text start="343.839" dur="5.31">different states have very different</text><text start="345.909" dur="4.5">perspectives on this and around the</text><text start="349.149" dur="2.58">country there&apos;s pretty different</text><text start="350.409" dur="4.861">perspectives all the way from the</text><text start="351.729" dur="6.06">beginning of you know say Sweden on one</text><text start="355.27" dur="8.19">side to Hongkong on another in terms of</text><text start="357.789" dur="8.34">how to approach this and you can really</text><text start="363.46" dur="4.709">see a difference in CFR and things like</text><text start="366.129" dur="5.31">that as a as a function of some of those</text><text start="368.169" dur="5.191">approaches as soon as the curve starts</text><text start="371.439" dur="4.26">to go down a little bit is not the time</text><text start="373.36" dur="3.419">that you start to release the shelter in</text><text start="375.699" dur="2.611">place which is the only thing that&apos;s</text><text start="376.779" dur="3.69">keeping it down you actually need to get</text><text start="378.31" dur="3.9">down to a relatively small number of</text><text start="380.469" dur="5.45">total cases within a region and the</text><text start="382.21" dur="5.759">region means the area in which there is</text><text start="385.919" dur="5.211">possibility for transmission so let&apos;s</text><text start="387.969" dur="6.081">say a city or a metropolitan area</text><text start="391.13" dur="5.2">you want to get down to a low total</text><text start="394.05" dur="6.15">number of cases in that area before you</text><text start="396.33" dur="6.45">start relaxing the shelter in place or</text><text start="400.2" dur="3.93">quarantine more otherwise you&apos;re going</text><text start="402.78" dur="2.67">to still get an uptick pretty quickly</text><text start="404.13" dur="4.58">we&apos;ve seen this happen in a number of</text><text start="405.45" dur="8.85">areas you also shouldn&apos;t think about</text><text start="408.71" dur="7.36">releasing it universally meaning we</text><text start="414.3" dur="2.99">already have a situation of essential</text><text start="416.07" dur="3.39">workers who are done</text><text start="417.29" dur="5.05">quarantine aren&apos;t on shelter in place</text><text start="419.46" dur="4.41">because for everyone else to be able to</text><text start="422.34" dur="3.9">be at home the utilities still have to</text><text start="423.87" dur="5.33">be on and farmers still have to be doing</text><text start="426.24" dur="7.43">agricultural work and grocery stores and</text><text start="429.2" dur="7.63">frontline workers and all like that so</text><text start="433.67" dur="4.9">there will be an increase in the kinds</text><text start="436.83" dur="2.91">of essential services that can start to</text><text start="438.57" dur="3.21">turn on while still being able to</text><text start="439.74" dur="4.83">protect more vulnerable populations as a</text><text start="441.78" dur="5.16">first step so the most vulnerable</text><text start="444.57" dur="4.41">populations call it in nursing homes and</text><text start="446.94" dur="2.7">elderly care facilities and places where</text><text start="448.98" dur="3.48">there are people who are</text><text start="449.64" dur="4.62">immunocompromised and those places</text><text start="452.46" dur="4.26">should stay on stricter protocols for a</text><text start="454.26" dur="4.35">longer period of time and there are some</text><text start="456.72" dur="4.68">people who have been calling anyways for</text><text start="458.61" dur="4.56">let everybody who is younger and healthy</text><text start="461.4" dur="6.09">not be on quarantine at all and just</text><text start="463.17" dur="6.93">protect the vulnerable populations it&apos;s</text><text start="467.49" dur="4.56">not a good idea to do that I wouldn&apos;t</text><text start="470.1" dur="3.3">suggest it&apos;s a good idea fifty percent</text><text start="472.05" dur="4.26">of the people in Italy who are on</text><text start="473.4" dur="5.73">ventilators were under 60 and a lot of</text><text start="476.31" dur="4.47">people get very serious cases definitely</text><text start="479.13" dur="4.32">people die who are young and healthy</text><text start="480.78" dur="4.47">people but even the people who don&apos;t die</text><text start="483.45" dur="5.4">because a lot of the people who get</text><text start="485.25" dur="5.07">severe illness right now who are younger</text><text start="488.85" dur="4.8">don&apos;t die but that doesn&apos;t mean that</text><text start="490.32" dur="6.15">there isn&apos;t lasting damage for them so</text><text start="493.65" dur="4.41">there are signs of many of the people</text><text start="496.47" dur="4.91">who got to severe illness who are coming</text><text start="498.06" dur="6.11">out who have fibrosis in the lungs</text><text start="501.38" dur="7.24">cardiomyopathy damage renal damage to</text><text start="504.17" dur="7.42">you know kidneys and so we shouldn&apos;t</text><text start="508.62" dur="4.28">only be thinking about did they die or</text><text start="511.59" dur="4.47">not we should also be thinking about</text><text start="512.9" dur="6.1">obviously not just how bad two months</text><text start="516.06" dur="4.03">was that for them in the hospital bills</text><text start="519.0" dur="3.19">and the</text><text start="520.09" dur="3.75">overwhelming I see use and all like that</text><text start="522.19" dur="4.8">that&apos;s associated but also the lifelong</text><text start="523.84" dur="6.66">consequences that can be had from</text><text start="526.99" dur="4.8">getting into advanced age also it&apos;s much</text><text start="530.5" dur="3.03">harder to protect the vulnerable</text><text start="531.79" dur="3.57">populations when much higher numbers of</text><text start="533.53" dur="8.82">people have it because there is cross</text><text start="535.36" dur="8.55">contamination so the first strategic</text><text start="542.35" dur="3.69">objective and we talked about it last</text><text start="543.91" dur="4.14">time was make sure that the total number</text><text start="546.04" dur="4.17">of cases doesn&apos;t exceed the capacity of</text><text start="548.05" dur="3.81">the ICUs in the various cities we saw</text><text start="550.21" dur="3.78">what happened in Italy when the ICU</text><text start="551.86" dur="3.45">capacity was exceeded and there weren&apos;t</text><text start="553.99" dur="2.82">enough ventilators and there wasn&apos;t</text><text start="555.31" dur="3.81">enough treatment options for people and</text><text start="556.81" dur="5.25">case fatality rate jumps very very</text><text start="559.12" dur="5.22">sharply we still could have a situation</text><text start="562.06" dur="4.44">where we mismanaged this and that</text><text start="564.34" dur="4.77">happens but for the most part we&apos;ve been</text><text start="566.5" dur="5.25">right at ICU capacity in some of the</text><text start="569.11" dur="5.43">worst hit areas like New York and New</text><text start="571.75" dur="6.21">Jersey but we haven&apos;t been in having to</text><text start="574.54" dur="10.89">decide if we have ventilators or ICU</text><text start="577.96" dur="9.99">beds as much so we do need to keep this</text><text start="585.43" dur="4.14">situation of making sure that the total</text><text start="587.95" dur="4.53">number of cases is within the capacity</text><text start="589.57" dur="4.92">of the icy use and also factoring the</text><text start="592.48" dur="3.75">fatigue of the frontline workers which</text><text start="594.49" dur="3.66">is a really significant thing that</text><text start="596.23" dur="4.83">probably everybody has watched plenty of</text><text start="598.15" dur="5.52">videos of nurses and doctors now who are</text><text start="601.06" dur="5.15">in some of the more intense fire zone</text><text start="603.67" dur="6.24">areas talking about their experience but</text><text start="606.21" dur="4.99">yeah New York has something like 80% of</text><text start="609.91" dur="3.9">the people who get put on ventilators</text><text start="611.2" dur="5.19">come off dead and we can talk about that</text><text start="613.81" dur="3.75">because it I think there are treatment</text><text start="616.39" dur="6.87">approaches that are much better than</text><text start="617.56" dur="8.01">ventilators that should be explored but</text><text start="623.26" dur="3.96">you can just imagine if you were nurse</text><text start="625.57" dur="3.06">working in a place and doing all the</text><text start="627.22" dur="3.21">work to ventilate someone in hope and</text><text start="628.63" dur="3.51">taking 80% of the people that you&apos;re</text><text start="630.43" dur="4.77">putting on and caring for off dead and</text><text start="632.14" dur="5.37">just what that&apos;s like there&apos;s only so</text><text start="635.2" dur="5.22">long that those people can do that also</text><text start="637.51" dur="6.81">as they have increased disease exposure</text><text start="640.42" dur="5.82">themselves so when we think about the</text><text start="644.32" dur="3.11">things that we can do</text><text start="646.24" dur="4.099">[Music]</text><text start="647.43" dur="6.48">that are relevant to mitigate the</text><text start="650.339" dur="5.761">disease let&apos;s think about the first part</text><text start="653.91" dur="4.77">being how do we decrease the total</text><text start="656.1" dur="3.9">number of infections the second part</text><text start="658.68" dur="3.54">being how do we decrease the percentage</text><text start="660.0" dur="4.02">of the infections that become severe in</text><text start="662.22" dur="3.42">the third part being how do we make sure</text><text start="664.02" dur="3.569">that there is enough treatment and ICU</text><text start="665.64" dur="4.25">capacity that wherever there are severe</text><text start="667.589" dur="4.891">infections are able to be well treated</text><text start="669.89" dur="4.75">this last step is how is getting</text><text start="672.48" dur="6.72">increased PPE to the hospital&apos;s</text><text start="674.64" dur="6.48">increased drugs and diagnostic tests and</text><text start="679.2" dur="3.66">things that have been rate limited to</text><text start="681.12" dur="3.45">some degree ventilators ICU beds</text><text start="682.86" dur="3.349">whatever and so there&apos;s a lot of kind of</text><text start="684.57" dur="4.44">logistics supply chain that has been</text><text start="686.209" dur="5.681">both super inspiring and the goodness of</text><text start="689.01" dur="4.8">people&apos;s work and super disheartening in</text><text start="691.89" dur="4.199">the poor Ness of the

the</text><text start="737.73" dur="5.51">wearing of masks this is something that</text><text start="740.16" dur="7.32">the Czech Republic got really exemplary</text><text start="743.24" dur="6.88">and has had a very low CFR and a very</text><text start="747.48" dur="7.32">good overall curve that they attribute</text><text start="750.12" dur="7.62">very much to the mask policy just to</text><text start="754.8" dur="4.47">clarify because there are still some</text><text start="757.74" dur="3.45">people who have confusion about the</text><text start="759.27" dur="4.02">effectiveness of wearing masks and some</text><text start="761.19" dur="4.05">of the major health organizations put</text><text start="763.29" dur="4.82">out information that&apos;s conflicting to</text><text start="765.24" dur="5.73">what we know now early in the process</text><text start="768.11" dur="4.479">the main reason to wear masks is not to</text><text start="770.97" dur="4.41">prevent you from getting the illness but</text><text start="772.589" dur="4.231">to prevent you from spreading it and the</text><text start="775.38" dur="2.88">main thing that keeps you from getting</text><text start="776.82" dur="3.48">in as other people wearing the mask so</text><text start="778.26" dur="2.35">that was the thing the Czech Republic</text><text start="780.3" dur="1.96">did</text><text start="780.61" dur="3.93">this commercial in this whole kind of</text><text start="782.26" dur="4.56">memetic campaign of I protect you you</text><text start="784.54" dur="5.64">protect me which is really nice kind of</text><text start="786.82" dur="4.98">campaign and that&apos;s because even if I</text><text start="790.18" dur="4.409">have a crappy mask I&apos;ve got just a</text><text start="791.8" dur="5.279">t-shirt right if I sneeze that&apos;s still</text><text start="794.589" dur="4.291">gonna block most of the droplets and</text><text start="797.079" dur="3.901">kind of larger particles from going and</text><text start="798.88" dur="3.87">getting becoming aerosolize getting in</text><text start="800.98" dur="3.68">the air getting on surfaces if I call if</text><text start="802.75" dur="4.89">it&apos;s gonna stop them from doing that and</text><text start="804.66" dur="5.41">so the main purpose of the mask wearing</text><text start="807.64" dur="5.16">is actually to keep the viral load in</text><text start="810.07" dur="4.079">the air and on the surfaces very low so</text><text start="812.8" dur="3.96">the space is safe for other people in</text><text start="814.149" dur="7.31">surfaces space say for other people in</text><text start="816.76" dur="8.819">the space now it is also true that</text><text start="821.459" dur="6.701">wearing PPE protects the wearer not</text><text start="825.579" dur="4.32">perfectly if you want perfect protection</text><text start="828.16" dur="3.419">you&apos;ve got to get in an Ebola suit and</text><text start="829.899" dur="3.93">in a bola suit used properly is pretty</text><text start="831.579" dur="5.161">close to perfect protection and you can</text><text start="833.829" dur="4.411">think about like then you know a full</text><text start="836.74" dur="3.36">face shield and personally powered</text><text start="838.24" dur="3.48">respirator is not quite as good as in a</text><text start="840.1" dur="3.39">bowl of soup but it&apos;s pretty pretty good</text><text start="841.72" dur="7.14">and then even just a face shield and</text><text start="843.49" dur="7.23">gown and whatever is pretty good but we</text><text start="848.86" dur="4.349">don&apos;t have exact stats on this because</text><text start="850.72" dur="3.989">it&apos;s not really an ethical study to try</text><text start="853.209" dur="3.151">and expose people with different types</text><text start="854.709" dur="4.831">of masks to different levels of viral</text><text start="856.36" dur="4.919">load and see how much they get sick but</text><text start="859.54" dur="3.44">the estimate is something in the</text><text start="861.279" dur="4.411">vicinity of if someone&apos;s wearing an n95</text><text start="862.98" dur="4.539">they&apos;re about five times less likely to</text><text start="865.69" dur="4.5">get sick from the same exposure as</text><text start="867.519" dur="4.26">someone who&apos;s not wearing a mask that&apos;s</text><text start="870.19" dur="3.259">pretty significant right a fifth of the</text><text start="871.779" dur="4.321">likelihood is pretty significant and</text><text start="873.449" dur="3.971">even a surgical mass is not going to be</text><text start="876.1" dur="3.989">what an n95 is but it&apos;ll be a</text><text start="877.42" dur="4.95">significant reduction especially if you</text><text start="880.089" dur="4.051">know how to use it properly so going to</text><text start="882.37" dur="4.77">YouTube and looking at how to use PPE</text><text start="884.14" dur="5.4">videos is important because if a masks</text><text start="887.14" dur="4.77">effective what it means effective for</text><text start="889.54" dur="5.28">protecting you is that the outside of it</text><text start="891.91" dur="4.56">might have viral particles on it so if</text><text start="894.82" dur="3.36">you come inside and then touch it with</text><text start="896.47" dur="3.21">the outside the outside of it with your</text><text start="898.18" dur="3.51">hands and then don&apos;t wash your hands</text><text start="899.68" dur="4.05">obviously you kind of violated the</text><text start="901.69" dur="6.509">process so there&apos;s a whole process for</text><text start="903.73" dur="7.74">just understanding how to how to utilize</text><text start="908.199" dur="4.981">gloves and masks and things like that</text><text start="911.47" dur="3.17">how to sterilize the packages when they</text><text start="913.18" dur="5.75">come to your house or when you bring</text><text start="914.64" dur="7.26">food and groceries home all of that is</text><text start="918.93" dur="5.7">called can be called aseptic method</text><text start="921.9" dur="4.35">right or basically just kind of advanced</text><text start="924.63" dur="4.35">hygiene everybody&apos;s giving some lessons</text><text start="926.25" dur="5.16">in advanced hygiene right now somebody</text><text start="928.98" dur="3.93">on one of the projects were working on</text><text start="931.41" dur="3.0">just wrote up a good article on aseptic</text><text start="932.91" dur="2.94">method and I can send it to you so you</text><text start="934.41" dur="6.23">can link it in here so anybody who wants</text><text start="935.85" dur="4.79">to study it will have that as a resource</text><text start="941.0" dur="5.32">[Music]</text><text start="942.68" dur="6.67">and this is going to be a huge part of</text><text start="946.32" dur="7.89">it is the mask wearing and the actual</text><text start="949.35" dur="6.9">hygiene and aseptic practices which will</text><text start="954.21" dur="4.14">keep viral load down tremendously</text><text start="956.25" dur="4.02">relative and viral transmission down</text><text start="958.35" dur="3.48">tremendously we should also have</text><text start="960.27" dur="3.24">something of course that like wind</text><text start="961.83" dur="3.51">stores start opening up besides</text><text start="963.51" dur="4.89">requiring people to have masks to come</text><text start="965.34" dur="5.55">in that hand sanitizers out front of</text><text start="968.4" dur="5.31">every place out front of banks out front</text><text start="970.89" dur="6.56">of supermarkets etc and that&apos;s just a</text><text start="973.71" dur="6.18">part of culture for some period of time</text><text start="977.45" dur="3.31">because even if someone has a mask they</text><text start="979.89" dur="2.34">might have been under the mask</text><text start="980.76" dur="3.72">scratching and then they&apos;re going in</text><text start="982.23" dur="5.64">touching surfaces in the store so the</text><text start="984.48" dur="5.31">the consciousness around that part of</text><text start="987.87" dur="8.85">aseptic technique is don&apos;t do that but</text><text start="989.79" dur="9.78">also the sanitizer in addition to these</text><text start="996.72" dur="4.86">things one of the areas that I think is</text><text start="999.57" dur="4.83">going to be hugely important and as</text><text start="1001.58" dur="5.01">least well talked about is the</text><text start="1004.4" dur="5.13">industrial hygiene or the environmental</text><text start="1006.59" dur="5.19">technologies and this is how can we</text><text start="1009.53" dur="5.55">actually employ technologies and spaces</text><text start="1011.78" dur="6.0">that take virus out of the air and kill</text><text start="1015.08" dur="5.16">it on surfaces or binded on surfaces so</text><text start="1017.78" dur="4.29">that even if there was the same amount</text><text start="1020.24" dur="3.69">of transmission going into the space</text><text start="1022.07" dur="3.269">there&apos;s less transmissibility happening</text><text start="1023.93" dur="4.97">in the space as a result of the</text><text start="1025.339" dur="5.971">technologies happening in the space so</text><text start="1028.9" dur="4.87">this is not stuff that we don&apos;t know how</text><text start="1031.31" dur="4.17">to do when you look at how a cleanroom</text><text start="1033.77" dur="3.27">works where you&apos;re experimenting with</text><text start="1035.48" dur="4.32">microbes you have to make sure that they</text><text start="1037.04" dur="6.299">say say a bioweapons laboratory for</text><text start="1039.8" dur="5.34">instance how to sterilize the space is</text><text start="1043.339" dur="3.541">something that is pretty well known and</text><text start="1045.14" dur="3.029">there&apos;s a lot of off-the-shelf kinds of</text><text start="1046.88" dur="2.609">technologies</text><text start="1048.169" dur="2.911">and there are some things that are</text><text start="1049.489" dur="2.851">really cheap and easy some things that</text><text start="1051.08" dur="4.319">are a little bit more advanced but</text><text start="1052.34" dur="4.769">really cheap and easy is like when the</text><text start="1055.399" dur="2.97">doctors wear a face shield the face</text><text start="1057.109" dur="3.121">shield makes a difference right because</text><text start="1058.369" dur="5.91">we&apos;re there&apos;s viral shedding in people&apos;s</text><text start="1060.23" dur="6.75">exhale and so the face shield just has a</text><text start="1064.279" dur="3.03">literal physical barrier beyond just a</text><text start="1066.98" dur="2.09">mask</text><text start="1067.309" dur="5.1">keeping it off their face off their eyes</text><text start="1069.07" dur="4.809">makes a difference so right now in</text><text start="1072.409" dur="2.911">grocery stores where people are still</text><text start="1073.879" dur="4.351">going to grocery stores in the grocery</text><text start="1075.32" dur="5.059">store workers have exposure to more</text><text start="1078.23" dur="3.899">people than almost anyone has right now</text><text start="1080.379" dur="4.691">there should just be a piece of</text><text start="1082.129" dur="4.77">plexiglass between the grocery store</text><text start="1085.07" dur="3.209">worker between the person at the</text><text start="1086.899" dur="2.671">checkout and everybody who&apos;s coming</text><text start="1088.279" dur="3.63">through just like there is a bank</text><text start="1089.57" dur="4.109">sometimes that&apos;s a really cheap easy</text><text start="1091.909" dur="4.26">solution that can be put in all those</text><text start="1093.679" dur="4.5">places with a few screws and in addition</text><text start="1096.169" dur="4.25">to the PPE on both sides you can</text><text start="1098.179" dur="4.47">sterilize that a number of times a day</text><text start="1100.419" dur="4.24">will decrease transmission pretty</text><text start="1102.649" dur="3.51">significantly so there&apos;s a lot of kind</text><text start="1104.659" dur="5.041">of pieces of environmental tech like</text><text start="1106.159" dur="6.931">that most people probably saw the videos</text><text start="1109.7" dur="5.219">of when Wuhan was on lockdown the</text><text start="1113.09" dur="3.719">massive disinfectant spraying in the</text><text start="1114.919" dur="3.63">streets drones were spraying and these</text><text start="1116.809" dur="3.99">huge trucks were spraying and like they</text><text start="1118.549" dur="5.1">were taking they were taking sanitizing</text><text start="1120.799" dur="4.771">the environment very seriously right we</text><text start="1123.649" dur="3.36">haven&apos;t seen a similar level of effort</text><text start="1125.57" dur="3.209">like that happen anywhere else but we</text><text start="1127.009" dur="3.63">also didn&apos;t see a curve come down as</text><text start="1128.779" dur="4.59">intensely anywhere else no that was for</text><text start="1130.639" dur="4.77">a number of reasons they they had a very</text><text start="1133.369" dur="4.44">big explosion at being at the epicenter</text><text start="1135.409" dur="7.35">of it but then they did very intensive</text><text start="1137.809" dur="6.3">methods to address it one research</text><text start="1142.759" dur="4.971">project that we brought together is a</text><text start="1144.109" dur="5.88">group of people who have background in</text><text start="1147.73" dur="4.659">chemical and physical engineering these</text><text start="1149.989" dur="4.17">types of topics who are looking in all</text><text start="1152.389" dur="3.63">the different air filtration methods so</text><text start="1154.159" dur="3.21">HEPA filters and Peko filters and</text><text start="1156.019" dur="4.59">ionization and those types of things</text><text start="1157.369" dur="5.01">that can actually take the virus out of</text><text start="1160.609" dur="6.81">the air either break it down or bind it</text><text start="1162.379" dur="7.831">or both and then things like UV lights</text><text start="1167.419" dur="4.801">there are specific frequencies of even</text><text start="1170.21" dur="6.929">visible light that look effective in the</text><text start="1172.22" dur="7.049">blue range and microwave and acoustics</text><text start="1177.139" dur="3.651">that all kill the virus some of these</text><text start="1179.269" dur="3.111">are safe to do when you</text><text start="1180.79" dur="3.6">in the room some aren&apos;t they&apos;d have to</text><text start="1182.38" dur="3.63">be done sanitizing in between there&apos;s</text><text start="1184.39" dur="5.46">obviously basic stuff like being able to</text><text start="1186.01" dur="6.51">sanitize and reuse PPE then sanitizing</text><text start="1189.85" dur="4.92">medical environments but also just lots</text><text start="1192.52" dur="3.42">of other environments like all of the</text><text start="1194.77" dur="4.14">fruits and vegetables that are being</text><text start="1195.94" dur="5.13">handled by all the workers what can we</text><text start="1198.91" dur="3.81">do not just when someone brings at home</text><text start="1201.07" dur="3.66">to be able to clean them properly but</text><text start="1202.72" dur="3.96">what can we put in the grocery stores to</text><text start="1204.73" dur="5.58">be able to decrease the transmission in</text><text start="1206.68" dur="7.41">grocery stores so for instance ozone gas</text><text start="1210.31" dur="5.1">happens to be very virus idle dissipates</text><text start="1214.09" dur="4.62">quite quickly so when the store closes</text><text start="1215.41" dur="5.1">at night could have those own gas going</text><text start="1218.71" dur="3.39">over the produce section or over other</text><text start="1220.51" dur="3.09">areas there&apos;s other gases there&apos;s other</text><text start="1222.1" dur="4.11">things that can be nebulized nebulized</text><text start="1223.6" dur="4.29">hydrogen peroxide so we&apos;re looking into</text><text start="1226.21" dur="5.1">these and types of environmental</text><text start="1227.89" dur="5.58">solutions there&apos;s also in addition to</text><text start="1231.31" dur="4.35">like surface disinfectants there are a</text><text start="1233.47" dur="4.56">few companies claiming to have surface</text><text start="1235.66" dur="4.98">treatments that can not just disinfect</text><text start="1238.03" dur="4.4">but be able to actually bind viruses on</text><text start="1240.64" dur="4.41">the surface for some period of time and</text><text start="1242.43" dur="4.21">we haven&apos;t been able to verify those</text><text start="1245.05" dur="4.5">claims yet we&apos;re in the process but</text><text start="1246.64" dur="5.28">that&apos;d be pretty awesome huge difference</text><text start="1249.55" dur="5.25">so the first place we really want to see</text><text start="1251.92" dur="4.68">these right away and working on getting</text><text start="1254.8" dur="5.07">a proposal together in the next week for</text><text start="1256.6" dur="4.62">it is obviously hospitals and I see use</text><text start="1259.87" dur="2.73">because it&apos;s the place where are not as</text><text start="1261.22" dur="3.41">the highest right now it&apos;s a place where</text><text start="1262.6" dur="4.47">there&apos;s the most total transmission</text><text start="1264.63" dur="4.18">because it&apos;s where you have the most</text><text start="1267.07" dur="3.42">sick people with the most severe</text><text start="1268.81" dur="4.08">sickness most severe sickness means</text><text start="1270.49" dur="6.18">coughing the most and the highest level</text><text start="1272.89" dur="5.43">of viral load I can&apos;t give any</text><text start="1276.67" dur="5.63">quantitative numbers because I don&apos;t</text><text start="1278.32" dur="3.98">believe they exist yet but it does seem</text><text start="1283.38" dur="5.47">most likely that the total level of</text><text start="1286.93" dur="3.66">viral load of exposure makes a</text><text start="1288.85" dur="3.81">difference to how likely someone is to</text><text start="1290.59" dur="4.38">get sick at all and the severity of the</text><text start="1292.66" dur="4.32">sickness and so it&apos;s not simply are you</text><text start="1294.97" dur="4.59">exposed to virus but are you exposed to</text><text start="1296.98" dur="4.05">a million viral particles or a few viral</text><text start="1299.56" dur="3.21">particles going to be very different</text><text start="1301.03" dur="5.31">terms the immune systems capacity to be</text><text start="1302.77" dur="5.25">able to respond to it and so these types</text><text start="1306.34" dur="4.05">of technologies could take down the</text><text start="1308.02" dur="4.08">viral load in the environments enough</text><text start="1310.39" dur="4.17">especially in the environments where</text><text start="1312.1" dur="5.04">people can&apos;t stop interacting</text><text start="1314.56" dur="4.23">that any that a lot of people just</text><text start="1317.14" dur="3.72">aren&apos;t exposed at all and any exposures</text><text start="1318.79" dur="4.38">are very low viral load exposures which</text><text start="1320.86" dur="4.71">means and which might

dur="4.65">someone can go in and be more likely to</text><text start="1455.4" dur="4.35">get kovat at the hospital than almost</text><text start="1456.87" dur="7.35">anywhere else and let&apos;s say

dur="5.73">they&apos;re touching something then all that</text><text start="1497.34" dur="4.1">needs to be sterilized between times</text><text start="1499.11" dur="4.47">that people are engaging with

dur="3.63">basically kind of logistical things and</text><text start="1507.66" dur="3.84">then there&apos;s the environmental tech in</text><text start="1509.25" dur="5.13">those spaces and the combo of being able</text><text start="1511.5" dur="4.74">to deploy things like the right kind of</text><text start="1514.38" dur="4.71">UV light to sterilize equipment in</text><text start="1516.24" dur="5.16">sterilized rooms the right kind of combo</text><text start="1519.09" dur="3.72">filtration method so like something like</text><text start="1521.4" dur="3.0">a Pecha filtration that can break the</text><text start="1522.81" dur="4.05">viruses down with something like a HEPA</text><text start="1524.4" dur="5.33">that combined them with the right kinds</text><text start="1526.86" dur="5.64">of disinfectants and surface treatments</text><text start="1529.73" dur="4.69">really could make the spaces radically</text><text start="1532.5" dur="4.38">safer and now then when we start to open</text><text start="1534.42" dur="5.31">back up widely and think about think</text><text start="1536.88" dur="4.8">about like train stations and airports</text><text start="1539.73" dur="4.74">and the places with very very high</text><text start="1541.68" dur="5.19">contact are the things that we can do</text><text start="1544.47" dur="6.78">you think about like a TSA person who&apos;s</text><text start="1546.87" dur="5.85">sick touching everybody&apos;s passports and</text><text start="1551.25" dur="2.669">whatever like the total amount of</text><text start="1552.72" dur="3.329">infectious transmission that could</text><text start="1553.919" dur="3.541">happen there is huge and if anyone else</text><text start="1556.049" dur="2.61">was sick and giving them the thing they</text><text start="1557.46" dur="3.42">they could get it right</text><text start="1558.659" dur="3.961">a symptomatically so the little thing</text><text start="1560.88" dur="4.14">that they scan under then it scans the</text><text start="1562.62" dur="4.59">barcode could we add UV to it they also</text><text start="1565.02" dur="3.69">sterilizes just basic kinds of</text><text start="1567.21" dur="4.31">environmental tech that could make a</text><text start="1568.71" dur="4.92">pretty significant difference</text><text start="1571.52" dur="4.659">the other big thing obviously is</text><text start="1573.63" dur="7.89">Diagnostics and contact tracing and this</text><text start="1576.179" dur="8.041">is widely talked about the types of</text><text start="1581.52" dur="7.26">Diagnostics matter and we see now the</text><text start="1584.22" dur="7.05">whole thing about like a hundred plus</text><text start="1588.78" dur="7.11">cases in South Korea that tested clear</text><text start="1591.27" dur="6.659">that our testing tested having had</text><text start="1595.89" dur="3.84">corona virus that they no longer had it</text><text start="1597.929" dur="4.561">and have it again kovat nineteen</text><text start="1599.73" dur="5.189">specifically and we&apos;re seeing that in</text><text start="1602.49" dur="4.26">other countries there is this massive</text><text start="1604.919" dur="3.39">question of whether or not immunity is</text><text start="1606.75" dur="2.7">conferred and the nature of how it&apos;s</text><text start="1608.309" dur="4.081">conferred and how long it will be</text><text start="1609.45" dur="6.209">convert for and across what set of</text><text start="1612.39" dur="5.85">mutations this is a super important</text><text start="1615.659" dur="3.031">question I&apos;ll I&apos;ll get back to why in a</text><text start="1618.24" dur="6.39">moment</text><text start="1618.69" dur="8.07">but what is it it is it that they really</text><text start="1624.63" dur="4.86">got better or was it the wrong kind of</text><text start="1626.76" dur="6.48">test is a very important question</text><text start="1629.49" dur="5.13">because it&apos;s not like all the tests are</text><text start="1633.24" dur="2.04">the same the tests are testing very</text><text start="1634.62" dur="7.439">different things</text><text start="1635.28" dur="9.6">so the antibody tests there are some</text><text start="1642.059" dur="6.051">people it appears maybe almost up to</text><text start="1644.88" dur="6.84">thirty percent of the people who are</text><text start="1648.11" dur="5.17">when using molecular methods using PCR</text><text start="1651.72" dur="4.77">methods where we know that they have</text><text start="1653.28" dur="5.19">this virus aren&apos;t producing meaningful</text><text start="1656.49" dur="3.36">antibodies there&apos;s a big question of</text><text start="1658.47" dur="3.3">like what&apos;s going on with that then</text><text start="1659.85" dur="3.93">there are some people who have</text><text start="1661.77" dur="4.26">antibodies where it&apos;s not clear that</text><text start="1663.78" dur="3.48">they actually ever had kovat 19 so</text><text start="1666.03" dur="2.94">there&apos;s a question of did they have one</text><text start="1667.26" dur="3.659">of the four other corona viruses that</text><text start="1668.97" dur="4.02">cause normal colds and that those</text><text start="1670.919" dur="5.551">antibodies are actually protective</text><text start="1672.99" dur="5.039">against this or in some cases so what is</text><text start="1676.47" dur="4.829">an antibody test mean verse</text><text start="1678.029" dur="5.97">what what are the actual PCR tests mean</text><text start="1681.299" dur="5.48">and if we&apos;re doing PCR on what fluids so</text><text start="1683.999" dur="5.55">there&apos;s a big thing around being able to</text><text start="1686.779" dur="4.181">when someone has been sick when do they</text><text start="1689.549" dur="2.641">get to come off quarantine well they</text><text start="1690.96" dur="3.36">should come off quarantine when there&apos;s</text><text start="1692.19" dur="3.659">no more viral shedding right when</text><text start="1694.32" dur="2.88">they&apos;re

period</text><text start="1700.679" dur="3.72">of time or lack of symptom ology it</text><text start="1702.749" dur="4.8">should be testing based but that</text><text start="1704.399" dur="5.311">requires the right types of tests more</text><text start="1707.549" dur="5.25">importantly is early on in the process</text><text start="1709.71" dur="5.009">we want to be able to test and if</text><text start="1712.799" dur="4.021">someone has been exposed we want to be</text><text start="1714.719" dur="4.71">able to know as close to when they got</text><text start="1716.82" dur="4.049">exposed as possible not days later if</text><text start="1719.429" dur="4.29">we&apos;re testing for antibodies it takes</text><text start="1720.869" dur="4.62">many days for it to go from landing on</text><text start="1723.719" dur="3.15">the mouth or landing in the nose to go</text><text start="1725.489" dur="3.32">through the mucosal immune system into</text><text start="1726.869" dur="6.3">the blood producing antibody response</text><text start="1728.809" dur="6.22">and depending upon the sensitivity of</text><text start="1733.169" dur="5.1">the PCR technique even if

start="1740.009" dur="4.11">it or does it have to wait for a lot of</text><text start="1741.509" dur="6.21">viral replication because if we&apos;re</text><text start="1744.119" dur="5.13">rolling out tests but someone has to</text><text start="1747.719" dur="3.54">have been exposed to three days before</text><text start="1749.249" dur="4.17">which means people are showing up clear</text><text start="1751.259" dur="3.66">but they&apos;re not just because of the</text><text start="1753.419" dur="4.14">earliness of false negatives that&apos;s not</text><text start="1754.919" dur="7.5">very effective so the kinds of tests</text><text start="1757.559" dur="7.56">that can be very high sensitivity can</text><text start="1762.419" dur="4.47">pick up small total viral count ideally</text><text start="1765.119" dur="6.99">be quantitative very fast turnaround</text><text start="1766.889" dur="8.04">times super-important so we we&apos;ve looked</text><text start="1772.109" dur="4.14">at the different types of tests and</text><text start="1774.929" dur="3.511">companies that are out there to be able</text><text start="1776.249" dur="6.87">to help with a suite of things that can</text><text start="1778.44" dur="7.859">meet the kind of national objectives and</text><text start="1783.119" dur="5.341">beyond national there happens to be one</text><text start="1786.299" dur="3.69">technology that&apos;s really asymmetrically</text><text start="1788.46" dur="4.649">further ahead and the rest of them that</text><text start="1789.989" dur="6.66">I&apos;m trying to help quite a lot that I</text><text start="1793.109" dur="6.51">think is going to be a major part of the</text><text start="1796.649" dur="4.44">infrastructure for how to do pandemic</text><text start="1799.619" dur="4.77">preparedness in the future where we were</text><text start="1801.089" dur="4.92">able to identify and go into smart</text><text start="1804.389" dur="3.811">quarantine

causes contact tracing maybe of all</text><text start="1813.36" dur="3.36">the things I&apos;d like the rebel wisdom</text><text start="1814.65" dur="8.21">people to know about and pay attention</text><text start="1816.72" dur="9.03">to would be contact tracing in order to</text><text start="1822.86" dur="4.48">have the testing be effective you either</text><text start="1825.75" dur="4.95">have to test everybody all the time</text><text start="1827.34" dur="5.55">right like test very big percentage of</text><text start="1830.7" dur="4.23">the total population and then if I test</text><text start="1832.89" dur="3.51">you today and you&apos;re negative that</text><text start="1834.93" dur="5.01">doesn&apos;t mean anything about do you go</text><text start="1836.4" dur="5.58">and get exposed tomorrow so you either</text><text start="1839.94" dur="4.68">need a pretty hype penetration on</text><text start="1841.98" dur="5.25">testing or you need some smart process</text><text start="1844.62" dur="3.9">to know who to test so that less total</text><text start="1847.23" dur="3.63">test can still be affect them so the</text><text start="1848.52" dur="6.27">goal of contact tracing is if you get</text><text start="1850.86" dur="6.36">tested and it shows oh you are positive</text><text start="1854.79" dur="4.86">that we can identify the people that you</text><text start="1857.22" dur="4.17">came in contact with over the period of</text><text start="1859.65" dur="4.08">time since you were probably exposed to</text><text start="1861.39" dur="5.94">get tests to them since they have higher</text><text start="1863.73" dur="6.57">likelihood and so we wanting to trace</text><text start="1867.33" dur="4.38">the contacts you&apos;ve had this is</text><text start="1870.3" dur="3.51">something that I have been very</text><text start="1871.71" dur="5.03">concerned by because this has been</text><text start="1873.81" dur="6.93">enacted in a number of countries Asian</text><text start="1876.74" dur="5.83">countries first and it is absolutely a</text><text start="1880.74" dur="3.78">kind of surveillance apparatus that I</text><text start="1882.57" dur="3.57">don&apos;t want States or companies to have</text><text start="1884.52" dur="3.09">and I don&apos;t think anybody actually</text><text start="1886.14" dur="4.11">thinks it&apos;s a good idea if you really</text><text start="1887.61" dur="4.53">think about it we&apos;ve been dealing with</text><text start="1890.25" dur="4.71">the surveillance capitalism problems</text><text start="1892.14" dur="5.31">that are already like so excessive that</text><text start="1894.96" dur="5.97">it&apos;s all it&apos;s very hard to see how we&apos;ll</text><text

recovery</text><text start="2191.49" dur="4.18">also with regard to ID Diagnostics it&apos;s</text><text start="2193.87" dur="3.84">important that we do some random testing</text><text start="2195.67"

that we put in place</text><text start="2241.72" dur="4.05">and yet the need to put provisions in</text><text start="2244.21" dur="3.3">place just making sure we&apos;re optimizing</text><text start="2245.77" dur="3.24">for both solving this problem and not</text><text start="2247.51" dur="4.83">causing other problems at the same time</text><text start="2249.01" dur="4.89">there&apos;s a key consideration one other</text><text start="2252.34" dur="4.08">thing I didn&apos;t say this should be</text><text start="2253.9" dur="11.13">happening already today before we even</text><text start="2256.42" dur="10.26">think about the dance phase is so I was</text><text start="2265.03" dur="3.03">mentioning all of that was how do you</text><text start="2266.68" dur="3.45">decrease the total amount of</text><text start="2268.06" dur="4.71">transmission but this other part is how</text><text start="2270.13" dur="4.44">do you make it to where people who are</text><text start="2272.77" dur="3.45">infected a smaller percentage of them</text><text start="2274.57" dur="4.68">have severe infections that&apos;s a huge</text><text start="2276.22" dur="7.05">question right now there&apos;s stuff being</text><text start="2279.25" dur="5.31">explored regarding plasma transfer so</text><text start="2283.27" dur="2.76">people who have recovered who have</text><text start="2284.56" dur="3.06">antibodies can we take their plasma</text><text start="2286.03" dur="5.07">injected and other people either as a</text><text start="2287.62" dur="5.37">treatment and or as a prevention it&apos;s</text><text start="2291.1" dur="3.74">interesting research not far enough</text><text start="2292.99" dur="3.99">along to know but like it&apos;s interesting</text><text start="2294.84" dur="4.0">it appears that there might be some</text><text start="2296.98" dur="4.2">people who from having had previous</text><text start="2298.84" dur="4.17">corona viruses recently might already</text><text start="2301.18" dur="4.4">have some background immunity and being</text><text start="2303.01" dur="5.82">able to identify that would be valuable</text><text start="2305.58" dur="6.7">but it&apos;s not known there is some</text><text start="2308.83" dur="6.54">indication that there are more and less</text><text start="2312.28" dur="5.73">virulent strains of this virus of SARS</text><text start="2315.37" dur="4.5">co2 and that there might be less</text><text start="2318.01" dur="4.14">virulent strains that people could be</text><text start="2319.87" dur="3.78">exposed to that wouldn&apos;t produce illness</text><text start="2322.15" dur="3.42">but would still produce a protective</text><text start="2323.65" dur="3.54">antibody to the more virulent strains so</text><text start="2325.57" dur="7.38">that&apos;s a very interesting kind of</text><text start="2327.19" dur="10.31">natural vaccine approach and you know</text><text start="2332.95" dur="4.55">herd immunity advancement type approach</text><text start="2339.93" dur="4.59">but in addition to that there&apos;s also</text><text start="2341.7" dur="5.7">treatments right not just can we have</text><text start="2344.52" dur="6.23">antibodies but are there antiviral and</text><text start="2347.4" dur="5.969">not just antiviral but h2 modulating and</text><text start="2350.75" dur="10.51">cytokine modulating and other types of</text><text start="2353.369" dur="9.901">treatments we there was so much talk</text><text start="2361.26" dur="3.39">about hydroxychloroquine because when</text><text start="2363.27" dur="2.91">Trump started talking about it obviously</text><text start="2364.65" dur="3.449">got a lot of attention and it became a</text><text start="2366.18" dur="3.99">highly politicized topic and then it</text><text start="2368.099" dur="6.69">wasn&apos;t about just doing medicine well it</text><text start="2370.17" dur="7.08">was about and you can see the biases</text><text start="2374.789" dur="4.29">right you could see people who just</text><text start="2377.25" dur="3.299">didn&apos;t want this to be that bad and</text><text start="2379.079" dur="3.0">wanted there to be an answer and so</text><text start="2380.549" dur="4.111">wanted to believe that there already was</text><text start="2382.079" dur="4.53">an answer and you could also see people</text><text start="2384.66" dur="3.27">who wanted Trump to be wrong and bad and</text><text start="2386.609" dur="2.821">stupid for having said something like</text><text start="2387.93" dur="3.33">that given that he wasn&apos;t a doctor a</text><text start="2389.43" dur="2.939">public health professional who kind of</text><text start="2391.26" dur="2.609">biased another direction and then they</text><text start="2392.369" dur="4.74">of course all read the data with that</text><text start="2393.869" dur="4.47">bias in mind so we tried to do a good</text><text start="2397.109" dur="3.411">letter to review that looked at the</text><text start="2398.339" dur="4.141">whole history of this very old drug</text><text start="2400.52" dur="3.519">hydroxychloroquine by itself and in</text><text start="2402.48" dur="5.67">combination this a through myosin</text><text start="2404.039" dur="6.75">doxycycline zinc other things and what&apos;s</text><text start="2408.15" dur="6.6">known about it on previous coronaviruses</text><text start="2410.789" dur="7.171">on previous SARS in in-vitro trials in</text><text start="2414.75" dur="4.859">mechanistic insights and in the kind of</text><text start="2417.96" dur="3.81">open label stuff that we have so far</text><text start="2419.609" dur="3.42">given that we don&apos;t have the quality of</text><text start="2421.77" dur="7.41">randomized control trials that we&apos;d</text><text start="2423.029" dur="8.34">normally want to see and what I will say</text><text start="2429.18" dur="3.48">about that is that it does not appear</text><text start="2431.369" dur="5.761">that it&apos;s particularly effective in</text><text start="2432.66" dur="6.75">late-stage but that&apos;s that&apos;s to be</text><text start="2437.13" dur="5.1">guessed because very few antivirals are</text><text start="2439.41" dur="9.09">effective in late-stage right it&apos;s</text><text start="2442.23" dur="9.48">generally the principal and medicine and</text><text start="2448.5" dur="5.43">with infectious disease and I&apos;m not a</text><text start="2451.71" dur="4.409">PhD in infectious disease research or</text><text start="2453.93" dur="8.33">medical doctor so I&apos;m just saying stuff</text><text start="2456.119" dur="8.281">here verify it yourself but if you have</text><text start="2462.26" dur="4.63">herpes outbreak and you take acyclovir</text><text start="2464.4" dur="4.29">within the first 24 hours maybe up to 48</text><text start="2466.89" dur="3.36">hours it can be quite effective and</text><text start="2468.69" dur="3.36">beyond that it does almost nothing</text><text start="2470.25" dur="3.81">and the same is true for shingles and</text><text start="2472.05" dur="5.31">the same is true for when you start the</text><text start="2474.06" dur="4.41">HIV cocktail can be very effective early</text><text start="2477.36" dur="4.86">on is not going to be very effective</text><text start="2478.47" dur="5.85">late so the idea of authorizing</text><text start="2482.22" dur="3.66">treatment for late stage or doing a</text><text start="2484.32" dur="3.45">randomized control trial late stage</text><text start="2485.88" dur="4.32">doesn&apos;t really make much sense based on</text><text start="2487.77" dur="6.21">the whole body of what&apos;s known about</text><text start="2490.2" dur="4.86">antiviral treatments in general this is</text><text start="2493.98" dur="3.2">actually something I&apos;m very concerned</text><text start="2495.06" dur="5.82">about is if a randomized control trial</text><text start="2497.18" dur="5.29">is done on whether it&apos;s lopen Avira REM</text><text start="2500.88" dur="3.81">des aveer or hydroxychloroquine or</text><text start="2502.47" dur="5.49">whatever but let&apos;s say it&apos;s done on any</text><text start="2504.69" dur="4.77">antiviral late stage and we find that</text><text start="2507.96" dur="3.27">it&apos;s not successful compared to the</text><text start="2509.46" dur="3.45">placebo group and then we over</text><text start="2511.23" dur="4.92">generalize that to say it&apos;s not</text><text start="2512.91" dur="4.59">successful and as opposed to it&apos;s not</text><text start="2516.15" dur="2.76">successful late stage we don&apos;t know</text><text start="2517.5" dur="4.53">anything about early stage if we didn&apos;t</text><text start="2518.91" dur="4.62">test it and the most successful</text><text start="2522.03" dur="3.51">antivirals we have that work towards</text><text start="2523.53" dur="5.01">anything aren&apos;t successful late stage</text><text start="2525.54" dur="4.8">that&apos;s just that&apos;s we shouldn&apos;t be doing</text><text start="2528.54" dur="3.51">that study that&apos;s a very bit dumb study</text><text start="2530.34" dur="2.82">now of course we would like to be able</text><text start="2532.05" dur="2.97">to treat late stage because there are</text><text start="2533.16" dur="3.57">some people who are there so I don&apos;t</text><text start="2535.02" dur="4.26">mind the randomized control trial that</text><text start="2536.73" dur="5.22">does both early stage and late stage in</text><text start="2539.28" dur="4.11">case we get lucky on late stage but the</text><text start="2541.95" dur="2.97">precedent should be anything being</text><text start="2543.39" dur="6.24">studied should be looking at early stage</text><text start="2544.92" dur="8.52">treatment I do want to say something</text><text start="2549.63" dur="6.57">about the epistemic s&apos; of randomized</text><text start="2553.44" dur="5.19">control trials but I have a couple open</text><text start="2556.2" dur="6.21">loops here the thing with regard to the</text><text start="2558.63" dur="6.09">hydroxychloroquine so we want to see</text><text start="2562.41" dur="4.38">randomized control trials early stage it</text><text

nonsense and only looking at</text><text start="2571.62" dur="2.79">late stage and aren&apos;t going to tell us</text><text start="2572.7" dur="6.18">anything that we don&apos;t already have a</text><text start="2574.41" dur="8.7">pretty good guess about but as it is do</text><text start="2578.88" dur="6.75">we have enough insight that most every</text><text start="2583.11" dur="4.8">doctor who I&apos;ve spoken with about this</text><text start="2585.63" dur="3.69">issue who studied it well has said this</text><text start="2587.91" dur="3.39">is what I would use for myself and my</text><text start="2589.32" dur="3.96">family even if I can&apos;t take that opinion</text><text start="2591.3" dur="4.68">that position publicly because it&apos;s not</text><text start="2593.28" dur="6.72">defensible traditionally yes yeah yes I</text><text start="2595.98" dur="6.18">had some quite famous infectious disease</text><text start="2600.0" dur="4.049">doc say this does I already have it for</text><text start="2602.16" dur="3.329">myself for and if any of me or my</text><text start="2604.049" dur="3.51">get sake this what I&apos;ll do but I can&apos;t</text><text start="2605.489" dur="4.171">talk about it publicly or say anything</text><text start="2607.559" dur="3.63">to that effect because the hospital</text><text start="2609.66" dur="3.569">system that I work for said I&apos;d lose my</text><text start="2611.189" dur="3.481">job I can&apos;t prescribe it to patients</text><text start="2613.229" dur="3.84">because the hospital system said that</text><text start="2614.67" dur="3.779">because they have been very trained with</text><text start="2617.069" dur="7.321">malpractice and other things to take</text><text start="2618.449" dur="9.51">maximally defensible positions so what I</text><text start="2624.39" dur="7.26">think is that in the hydroxychloroquine</text><text start="2627.959" dur="5.13">it&apos;s interesting because it&apos;s generic so</text><text start="2631.65" dur="3.599">nobody can make all that much money on</text><text start="2633.089" dur="9.24">it because anybody can make it right</text><text start="2635.249" dur="8.61">it&apos;s off patent now so since any company</text><text start="2642.329" dur="4.17">can make it they&apos;re just competing on</text><text start="2643.859" dur="6.96">the margins of being able to you know</text><text start="2646.499" dur="5.79">produce the goods slightly cheaper real</text><text start="2650.819" dur="4.68">money is made for things that are still</text><text start="2652.289" dur="7.22">on patent so if someone if we were</text><text start="2655.499" dur="7.23">wanting to look at kind of predatory</text><text start="2659.509" dur="5.47">perverse incentive it would most likely</text><text start="2662.729" dur="5.671">be to prove that the generic things</text><text start="2664.979" dur="5.04">don&apos;t work to motivate the movement of</text><text start="2668.4" dur="3.75">drugs that actually have more money to</text><text start="2670.019" dur="3.66">be made and there&apos;s been some</text><text

dur="4.41">then decide if you seemed like a safe</text><text start="2922.44" dur="4.47">person to do it with where the benefits</text><text start="2924.03" dur="7.29">of doing it outweigh the possible

dur="11.28">medicine with regard to shortage and</text><text start="2939.39" dur="9.3">supply so if we look at the food supply</text><text start="2945.18" dur="7.83">system right now we see that there are</text><text start="2948.69" dur="5.46">areas where farmers are telling crop</text><text start="2953.01" dur="3.75">back into the soil</text><text start="2954.15" dur="4.47">potatoes are rotting

dur="4.71">happening because of food excesses</text><text start="2967.88" dur="5.4">because the normal distribution channels</text><text start="2970.56" dur="5.04">which are stores that aren&apos;t

for whatever set of</text><text start="3004.7" dur="3.72">reasons got where it needs to go it&apos;s</text><text start="3007.04" dur="2.97">the best of my understanding that&apos;s the</text><text start="3008.42" dur="3.66">case for the hydroxychloroquine there</text><text start="3010.01" dur="4.5">are both meaningful existing stockpiles</text><text start="3012.08" dur="5.07">and a lot of places that are up ramping</text><text start="3014.51" dur="4.74">their capability to produce it because</text><text start="3017.15" dur="4.47">it&apos;s an extremely simple molecule and</text><text

something that is actually</text><text start="3034.85" dur="6.02">producible for large population</text><text start="3037.61" dur="3.26">developing world type places</text><text start="3041.83" dur="6.46">so one of the things we did was so there</text><text start="3046.1" dur="4.14">was this there was a Chinese study and</text><text start="3048.29" dur="3.15">there were questions about the validity</text><text start="3050.24" dur="3.06">of the Chinese study there were two</text><text start="3051.44" dur="4.47">Chinese studies actually then there was</text><text start="3053.3" dur="4.29">this French study that got a lot of news</text><text start="3055.91" dur="3.21">and there were questions about the</text><text start="3057.59" dur="4.05">appropriateness of the methodology on</text><text start="3059.12" dur="6.81">the French study then there was this New</text><text start="3061.64" dur="6.33">York doctor Solanco who did it and you</text><text start="3065.93" dur="4.02">know he was claiming near pretty close</text><text start="3067.97" dur="4.95">to perfect results and there were</text><text start="3069.95" dur="4.38">questions about his methodology and then</text><text start="3072.92" dur="3.15">there were more people that started</text><text start="3074.33" dur="7.38">claiming that they were having success</text><text start="3076.07" dur="8.19">using it so we just brought a few MDS</text><text start="3081.71" dur="4.2">together who understood the pharmacology</text><text start="3084.26" dur="4.38">of the drug did a review of all the</text><text start="3085.91" dur="4.2">literature and then called all the</text><text start="3088.64" dur="3.09">doctors we could find who had been using</text><text start="3090.11" dur="3.24">it in this country and in other</text><text start="3091.73" dur="3.09">countries and especially doing early</text><text start="3093.35" dur="4.5">treatment and said just give us all your</text><text start="3094.82" dur="4.41">data so what how many people did you</text><text start="3097.85" dur="3.12">treat what were they presenting with</text><text start="3099.23" dur="4.02">what kinds of diagnostics did you do up</text><text start="3100.97" dur="4.83">front and then what have you seen in</text><text start="3103.25" dur="6.3">terms of progression to severe cases and</text><text start="3105.8" dur="5.75">like that this is not randomized this is</text><text start="3109.55" dur="5.94">not placebo controlled double or single</text><text start="3111.55" dur="6.85">blinded it is

start="3122.81" dur="4.65">we could look at the total effect that</text><text start="3125.84" dur="4.08">placebos the range of effect that</text><text start="3127.46" dur="4.14">placebos have for

a specific range</text><text start="3134.54" dur="3.39">of success where you can remove that</text><text start="3135.98" dur="3.57">statistical artifact and see is there an</text><text start="3137.93" dur="4.47">effect beyond the type of effective Lisi</text><text start="3139.55" dur="4.319">Bo&apos;s typically have especially when you</text><text start="3142.4" dur="4.56">see that there are

dur="5.46">pretty large number of doctors said that</text><text start="3154.01" dur="7.41">the people that they had been treating</text><text start="3156.77" dur="11.01">early on who were presenting

in the</text><text start="3336.1" dur="6.79">support of I wonder you mentioned the</text><text start="3341.21" dur="3.71">second and third order effects and you</text><text start="3342.89" dur="4.62">talked about a lot of those in the last</text><text start="3344.92" dur="5.68">film that we put out are you seeing any</text><text start="3347.51" dur="4.41">of those well we already mentioned some</text><text start="3350.6" dur="9.03">of them right like talking about the</text><text start="3351.92" dur="10.74">food supply so the the huge number of</text><text start="3359.63" dur="7.219">locusts that are in parts of northern</text><text start="3362.66" dur="6.439">Africa and parts of the Middle East</text><text start="3366.849" dur="4.68">they the locusts were already there</text><text start="3369.099" dur="4.801">before the Kovan thing happened but they</text><text start="3371.529" dur="4.05">got much much worse I don&apos;t know the</text><text start="3373.9" dur="3.75">specific stats on how much worse in</text><text start="3375.579" dur="4.88">recent infestations but it&apos;s definitely</text><text start="3377.65" dur="5.639">the biggest thing in recent times and</text><text start="3380.459" dur="7.9">destroyed crops in those areas that was</text><text start="3383.289" dur="6.93">actually because of travel bans that</text><text start="3388.359" dur="4.35">kept the pesticides from getting to the</text><text start="3390.219" dur="3.81">farmers and so because they couldn&apos;t</text><text start="3392.709" dur="3.54">give the pesticides they couldn&apos;t treat</text><text start="3394.029" dur="3.69">for the past&apos;s and because they were you</text><text start="3396.249" dur="3.51">know doing agriculture that&apos;s very</text><text start="3397.719" dur="6.691">susceptible to pests then they were all</text><text start="3399.759" dur="6.51">able to be devastated there were similar</text><text start="3404.41" dur="4.859">kinds of things that happened in India</text><text start="3406.269" dur="7.08">that led to crops rotting in fields and</text><text start="3409.269" dur="6.361">so we have this over demand and under</text><text start="3413.349" dur="5.76">demand supply chain set of issues where</text><text start="3415.63" dur="5.639">we have both rotting food damaged food</text><text start="3419.109" dur="4.95">supplies and people with no access to</text><text start="3421.269" dur="5.07">food simultaneously and we&apos;re just at</text><text start="3424.059" dur="4.26">the beginning of those effects starting</text><text start="3426.339" dur="3.96">to happen but those effects</text><text start="3428.319" dur="3.39">don&apos;t go away very quickly right like if</text><text start="3430.299" dur="3.3">you lose a crop that&apos;s gonna have some</text><text start="3431.709" dur="4.8">enduring effect and then you start</text><text start="3433.599" dur="5.041">getting manipulation on the price of</text><text start="3436.509" dur="5.22">food commodities so could there be</text><text start="3438.64" dur="4.74">escalation to food riots or wars over</text><text start="3441.729" dur="3.24">food shortages in areas where people</text><text start="3443.38" dur="3.299">don&apos;t have food like those are very real</text><text start="3444.969" dur="3.661">things and especially when you look at a</text><text start="3446.679" dur="3.18">place like India where the total number</text><text start="3448.63" dur="3.959">of people that could be in food shortage</text><text start="3449.859" dur="4.5">is a huge number of people then does</text><text start="3452.589" dur="3.811">that lead to violence does that cleave</text><text start="3454.359" dur="4.771">along Muslim Hindu lines could that</text><text start="3456.4" dur="4.049">escalate to India Pakistan issues so</text><text start="3459.13" dur="3.0">this is where we&apos;re looking at an issue</text><text start="3460.449" dur="4.73">where you&apos;ve already got systemic</text><text start="3462.13" dur="7.909">fragility and you&apos;ve already got</text><text start="3465.179" dur="4.86">basically a situation primed for</text><text start="3470.489" dur="6.22">catalysis types events where you know</text><text start="3474.4" dur="6.629">the the financial system pretty much</text><text start="3476.709" dur="8.07">broke right the economy is</text><text start="3481.029" dur="6.33">extraordinarily damaged the social</text><text start="3484.779" dur="4.83">fabric has been very damaged in lots of</text><text start="3487.359" dur="4.391">areas we weren&apos;t talking about this very</text><text start="3489.609" dur="4.941">much but</text><text start="3491.75" dur="4.42">in addition to the mental health crisis</text><text start="3494.55" dur="4.11">that&apos;s happening from people being at</text><text start="3496.17" dur="3.78">home and not able to take care of their</text><text start="3498.66" dur="3.83">mind and the way they&apos;re used to in the</text><text start="3499.95" dur="4.95">increased anxiety do we start seeing</text><text start="3502.49" dur="4.18">benzo prescriptions go way up that&apos;ll</text><text start="3504.9" dur="3.63">also have a long tail of the damaging</text><text start="3506.67" dur="3.6">effects of the benzo prescriptions are</text><text start="3508.53" dur="5.22">we seeing increased domestic violence</text><text start="3510.27" dur="6.03">both spousal ii and towards children as</text><text start="3513.75" dur="4.56">people are in proximity with each other</text><text start="3516.3" dur="3.93">that they aren&apos;t used to having it and</text><text start="3518.31" dur="6.17">then what are the long path societal</text><text start="3520.23" dur="4.25">effects of that trauma that occurs right</text><text start="3525.08" dur="5.89">obviously it doesn&apos;t take very long to</text><text start="3528.66" dur="3.87">destroy a small business takes a pretty</text><text start="3530.97" dur="4.32">long time to rebuild an effective small</text><text start="3532.53" dur="4.44">business and it&apos;s like cutting down an</text><text start="3535.29" dur="5.28">old-growth forest do you just don&apos;t get</text><text start="3536.97" dur="8.64">one back very quickly and so the damage</text><text start="3540.57" dur="6.84">to just basically the unemployment and</text><text start="3545.61" dur="5.19">we&apos;ve seen what the unemployment just</text><text start="3547.41" dur="8.73">complete skyrocket 10x plus any previous</text><text start="3550.8" dur="7.23">you know similar time period people</text><text start="3556.14" dur="3.69">don&apos;t get to refine jobs as quickly as</text><text start="3558.03" dur="4.38">they lost them or rebuild businesses or</text><text start="3559.83" dur="5.52">so there are enduring effects there</text><text start="3562.41" dur="4.5">obviously if surveillance apparatus is</text><text start="3565.35" dur="11.67">put in of the wrong type they&apos;re very</text><text start="3566.91" dur="13.23">enduring effects so I think that and</text><text start="3577.02" dur="5.4">then you also have things like the you</text><text start="3580.14" dur="4.02">know the nature of alliances and</text><text start="3582.42" dur="4.13">geopolitical tensions has already</text><text start="3584.16" dur="7.44">changed the world and it&apos;s just not all</text><text start="3586.55" dur="6.97">realized yet but the EU is already in a</text><text start="3591.6" dur="4.2">very vulnerable position for lots of</text><text start="3593.52" dur="5.04">reasons and this was just on the tails</text><text start="3595.8" dur="4.53">of brexit and then having some countries</text><text start="3598.56" dur="3.36">get hit so hard and not receive EU</text><text start="3600.33" dur="3.06">support from other countries that got</text><text start="3601.92" dur="3.24">hit much less hard because they use</text><text start="3603.39" dur="3.0">their own resources but they didn&apos;t feel</text><text start="3605.16" dur="4.02">like they had enough resource to help</text><text start="3606.39" dur="6.24">the other ones what does that do to the</text><text start="3609.18" dur="4.98">EU and then specifically how do other</text><text start="3612.63" dur="3.36">state actors that have very strong</text><text start="3614.16" dur="4.29">agenda with regard to what happens how</text><text start="3615.99" dur="5.1">does Russia play that situation to
