can we talk</text><text start="90.569" dur="3.571">about some of the specific examples of</text><text start="92.52" dur="4.86">the generator functions and what they</text><text start="94.14" dur="5.13">look like in a society okay so I want to</text><text start="97.38" dur="4.23">look at these same two generator</text><text start="99.27" dur="4.529">functions through a couple different</text><text start="101.61" dur="6.11">lenses that end up mapping to the same</text><text start="103.799" dur="6.36">thing but these lenses are valuable so</text><text start="107.72" dur="6.91">one way of saying what needs to happen</text><text start="110.159" dur="7.621">is that we need systems of collective</text><text start="114.63" dur="6.75">intelligence and collective sense making</text><text start="117.78" dur="6.929">and choice making that increase with</text><text start="121.38" dur="4.109">scale effectively and I&apos;ll say why that</text><text start="124.709" dur="4.8">makes sense</text><text start="125.489" dur="5.97">if you look at Jeffery West&apos;s work out</text><text start="129.509" dur="4.95">of Santa Fe Institute this book scale is</text><text start="131.459" dur="5.31">a classic example we see that you&apos;ve got</text><text start="134.459" dur="4.741">productive capacity or intelligence</text><text start="136.769" dur="3.81">capacity design capacity of a persons</text><text start="139.2" dur="2.939">and you bring a few people together and</text><text start="140.579" dur="3.931">you get increased productive capacity</text><text start="142.139" dur="4.831">and for a little while you&apos;ll actually</text><text start="144.51" dur="4.17">get an exponential up curve where more</text><text start="146.97" dur="3.45">people give you a lot more ability</text><text start="148.68" dur="2.88">because they&apos;re sharing new capacities</text><text start="150.42" dur="2.64">and this is the startup phase or</text><text start="151.56" dur="3.09">something but pretty soon you get an</text><text start="153.06" dur="3.48">inflection point where adding more</text><text start="154.65" dur="3.989">people starts having diminishing returns</text><text start="156.54" dur="7.319">per capita and then you get to this</text><text start="158.639" dur="7.201">table incurring more people is not</text><text start="163.859" dur="6.091">increasing it up to capacity really at</text><text start="165.84" dur="7.11">all and so if I have a curve where more</text><text start="169.95" dur="6.06">people don&apos;t keep adding adaptive</text><text start="172.95" dur="4.83">capacity well then those people will</text><text start="176.01" dur="3.479">always have an incentive to defect</text><text start="177.78" dur="3.9">against that system because they&apos;ll</text><text start="179.489" dur="4.711">actually have more adaptive capacity per</text><text start="181.68" dur="4.8">capita if they defect against it and so</text><text start="184.2" dur="4.2">as long as I have a system of collective</text><text start="186.48" dur="3.99">intelligence that can not scale with the</text><text start="188.4" dur="4.919">number of people it can&apos;t include</text><text start="190.47" dur="5.4">everybody right and and it will always</text><text start="193.319" dur="5.071">force its own collapse its own defection</text><text start="195.87" dur="2.82">so far we found that all the things that</text><text start="198.39" dur="2.94">we</text><text start="198.69" dur="5.13">all like intentionally made human</text><text start="201.33" dur="5.01">systems countries and companies have</text><text start="203.82" dur="4.53">this type of curve and so again this</text><text start="206.34" dur="3.66">shows why none of those can make it this</text><text start="208.35" dur="4.08">is a design criteria saying of if I&apos;m</text><text start="210.0" dur="4.89">making were creating a social system if</text><text start="212.43" dur="4.53">it doesn&apos;t have sense making in choice</text><text start="214.89" dur="4.2">making able to increase at least</text><text start="216.96" dur="4.05">linearly with number of people through</text><text start="219.09" dur="3.3">some process then the people will defect</text><text start="221.01" dur="3.3">against that system as soon as you pass</text><text start="222.39" dur="3.54">the inflection point and now they&apos;ll</text><text start="224.31" dur="5.16">either defect against it make their own</text><text start="225.93" dur="5.13">thing completely unless the big system</text><text start="229.47" dur="3.18">even though it&apos;s less efficient per</text><text start="231.06" dur="3.06">capita than them is still a lot bigger</text><text start="232.65" dur="3.3">than them and it would take them out in</text><text start="234.12" dur="4.29">which case it&apos;s not safe to overtly</text><text start="235.95" dur="3.96">defect then they covertly defect they</text><text start="238.41" dur="3.56">defect with while staying within the</text><text start="239.91" dur="3.81">system which starts to look like</text><text start="241.97" dur="3.88">everything you see in the world today</text><text start="243.72" dur="4.29">where someone looks at okay what is my</text><text start="245.85" dur="4.14">particular bonus structure and how can i</text><text start="248.01" dur="3.09">optimize getting the most bonuses here</text><text start="249.99" dur="4.56">even though it&apos;s not what fits to the</text><text start="251.1" dur="4.56">company they have now defected against</text><text start="254.55" dur="2.7">the well-being of the whole because</text><text start="255.66" dur="4.92">their own incentive and the well-being</text><text start="257.25" dur="6.59">of the whole are actually ante coupled</text><text start="260.58" dur="7.98">or at least missed and we can see that</text><text start="263.84" dur="7.09">almost everywhere people within systems</text><text start="268.56" dur="3.99">have actually defected against being</text><text start="270.93" dur="2.16">optimally aligned with the integrity of</text><text start="272.55" dur="2.49">the system</text><text start="273.09" dur="5.01">they&apos;re basically preying on the system</text><text start="275.04" dur="4.74">in some way and while continuing to look</text><text start="278.1" dur="3.45">like they&apos;re serving it because that&apos;s</text><text start="279.78" dur="4.41">where the incentive is and that&apos;s going</text><text start="281.55" dur="4.89">to of course make the system radically</text><text start="284.19" dur="5.1">unadapted and speed up the rate of its</text><text start="286.44" dur="5.7">inevitable decline and so if I could get</text><text start="289.29" dur="4.68">a system it could scale its actual</text><text start="292.14" dur="3.63">adaptive capacity with a number of</text><text start="293.97" dur="3.27">people that were in the people being in</text><text start="295.77" dur="2.97">the system would always be better for</text><text start="297.24" dur="4.32">them and participating with it than</text><text start="298.74" dur="7.14">defecting against it in covertly or</text><text start="301.56" dur="6.33">overtly one way of looking at it is of</text><text start="305.88" dur="4.83">what we have to solve is that sense</text><text start="307.89" dur="4.89">making in choice making processes fit</text><text start="310.71" dur="4.89">scale add activity right were the</text><text start="312.78" dur="5.19">adaptiveness scales number people will</text><text start="315.6" dur="3.84">come back to this in a minute as this</text><text start="317.97" dur="2.61">into being a very central way of</text><text start="319.44" dur="3.32">thinking about it when we talk about</text><text start="320.58" dur="4.74">rivalries dynamics creating problems</text><text start="322.76" dur="4.81">antirattle risk dynamics coherence</text><text start="325.32" dur="3.69">dynamics of agents with other agents are</text><text start="327.57" dur="4.19">core to the solutions that we&apos;re looking</text><text start="329.01" dur="4.64">at it also ends up being the coherence</text><text start="331.76" dur="4.02">what solves a lot of the problems of the</text><text start="333.65" dur="3.96">open-loop syntax because just how when</text><text start="335.78" dur="3.27">we were talking about in democracy the</text><text start="337.61" dur="3.0">process of making a proposition</text><text start="339.05" dur="2.79">somebody&apos;s sensing something they care</text><text start="340.61" dur="2.94">about they make a proposition the</text><text start="341.84" dur="2.64">benefits it but it harms other things</text><text start="343.55" dur="3.12">that they might not have even been</text><text start="344.48" dur="4.23">sensing how do we bring all the sensors</text><text start="346.67" dur="3.99">together to say what is everything</text><text start="348.71" dur="4.14">important connected to this hold those</text><text start="350.66" dur="4.41">as design constraints and then go into</text><text start="352.85" dur="3.57">an integrated design process that is</text><text start="355.07" dur="3.48">trying to meet all of those design</text><text start="356.42" dur="4.08">constraints that sounds like the future</text><text start="358.55" dur="3.99">of governance but it also sounds like</text><text start="360.5" dur="3.63">the future of technology design right to</text><text start="362.54" dur="3.12">make technology that&apos;s not externalizing</text><text start="364.13" dur="4.23">harm and that also means infrastructure</text><text start="365.66" dur="4.32">design and so coherence between all the</text><text start="368.36" dur="5.04">agents that are sensing a part of the</text><text start="369.98" dur="4.8">system means that all the information</text><text start="373.4" dur="3.09">from all the parts of the system get to</text><text start="374.78" dur="3.66">be internalized to the decision-making</text><text start="376.49" dur="4.92">processes right to the choice making</text><text start="378.44" dur="5.31">processes which means that externalities</text><text start="381.41" dur="4.83">get internalized and so interpersonal</text><text start="383.75" dur="4.53">coherence at scale ends up being a</text><text start="386.24" dur="4.59">central way of thinking about this now</text><text start="388.28" dur="4.8">another way of thinking about it is the</text><text start="390.83" dur="3.93">generator function of all the extras so</text><text start="393.08" dur="5.34">one thing we just said is the generator</text><text start="394.76" dur="5.37">function is social in coherence right</text><text start="398.42" dur="3.36">how it was actually what we just said as</text><text start="400.13" dur="3.57">a generator function spoke through the</text><text start="401.78" dur="3.75">language of collective intelligence this</text><text start="403.7" dur="4.05">ability to scale another way of looking</text><text start="405.53" dur="4.29">at it is that the source of all of the</text><text start="407.75" dur="4.05">risks and also the things that have</text><text start="409.82" dur="3.92">always sucked the risks are just the</text><text start="411.8" dur="5.43">things that have always sucked bigger is</text><text start="413.74" dur="5.8">the relationship between choice and</text><text start="417.23" dur="4.86">causation an inappropriate relationship</text><text start="419.54" dur="5.16">between choice and causation as two</text><text start="422.09" dur="4.95">types of change and this is going to get</text><text start="424.7" dur="4.26">into a very tricky philosophic area</text><text start="427.04" dur="3.93">which is partly why I said the thing</text><text start="428.96" dur="5.31">that we call science and tech is</text><text start="430.97" dur="5.85">necessary but not sufficient so science</text><text start="434.27" dur="5.61">is a theory of causation right when we</text><text start="436.82" dur="5.16">study law what we&apos;re studying the laws</text><text start="439.88" dur="6.81">of physics or the laws of any domain are</text><text start="441.98" dur="7.56">the rules that create change causal</text><text start="446.69" dur="5.28">chain train and we study and even more</text><text start="449.54" dur="4.59">curly in computer science computation</text><text start="451.97" dur="3.84">means rule-based transform and so</text><text start="454.13" dur="3.33">something is changing it&apos;s transforming</text><text start="455.81" dur="4.11">from one state to another state in a</text><text start="457.46" dur="3.81">perfectly predictable way governed by a</text><text start="459.92" dur="4.71">rule set all set</text><text start="461.27" dur="5.85">so causation not true</text><text start="464.63" dur="4.68">we don&apos;t have a Serie of choice which is</text><text start="467.12" dur="4.38">why every philosophic conversation gets</text><text start="469.31" dur="4.5">into free will and determinism and get</text><text start="471.5" dur="3.96">stuck there and Sam Harrison Dennett</text><text start="473.81" dur="2.91">debate it out and get nowhere and at the</text><text start="475.46" dur="2.7">end of the day say we just have</text><text start="476.72" dur="3.87">different intuitions on this and that&apos;s</text><text start="478.16" dur="4.68">happened since forever in philosophy and</text><text start="480.59" dur="4.38">we could actually get into that topic at</text><text start="482.84" dur="4.86">depth at some point does require some</text><text start="484.97" dur="6.15">nuance to do well but we are making</text><text start="487.7" dur="5.34">choices we are at minimum operating as</text><text start="491.12" dur="5.49">if we were making choices and we are</text><text start="493.04" dur="6.39">making choices that are extended by text</text><text start="496.61" dur="5.61">knowledge of causation so before I got</text><text start="499.43" dur="4.86">the tech and I was just predator I could</text><text start="502.22" dur="3.87">hit somebody with my fist but then I</text><text start="504.29" dur="3.42">could understand causation and say the</text><text start="506.09" dur="3.24">heavier the thing is and the faster it</text><text start="507.71" dur="3.69">goes and the harder it is very causal</text><text start="509.33" dur="4.35">principle some more damage it causes and</text><text start="511.4" dur="4.62">so I can extend my fist through a stone</text><text start="513.68" dur="4.89">hammer then I can extend it through a</text><text start="516.02" dur="5.19">sword right then I can extend it to a</text><text start="518.57" dur="5.19">gun then I can extend through a and so</text><text start="521.21" dur="7.44">I&apos;m taking my knowledge of causation</text><text start="523.76" dur="8.04">science and creating technology applied</text><text start="528.65" dur="5.64">science that allows my choice still to</text><text start="531.8" dur="6.21">be extended through levers very powerful</text><text start="534.29" dur="5.58">levers science is giving me a a theory</text><text start="538.01" dur="4.8">of causation that can create applied</text><text start="539.87" dur="4.68">causation without giving me a theory of</text><text start="542.81" dur="5.13">choice that tells me how to use that</text><text start="544.55" dur="4.89">increased causal power and this has been</text><text start="547.94" dur="3.21">a classic thing in the philosophy of</text><text start="549.44" dur="4.47">science from the time of Descartes that</text><text start="551.15" dur="4.68">science says what is not what ought that</text><text start="553.91" dur="3.21">it is the realm of objectives this is</text><text start="555.83" dur="3.17">but we can&apos;t say anything about what</text><text start="557.12" dur="5.37">ought because we don&apos;t deal in</text><text start="559.0" dur="5.35">objectives and you know through most</text><text start="562.49" dur="3.84">interpretations of physicalism the</text><text start="564.35" dur="3.99">entire thing is meaningless and</text><text start="566.33" dur="3.84">deterministic anyways and so it just</text><text start="568.34" dur="3.87">means something that we can&apos;t even make</text><text start="570.17" dur="5.12">sense of well now there&apos;s a real</text><text start="572.21" dur="5.16">in here this is a real problem which his</text><text start="575.29" dur="3.55">science gives us the ability to</text><text start="577.37" dur="4.86">understand the physical world very</text><text start="578.84" dur="5.16">deeply and to create technology that can</text><text start="582.23" dur="6.45">change the physical world very deeply</text><text start="584.0" dur="6.5">and so it is the most powerful Avenue</text><text start="588.68" dur="4.14">for affecting the physical world</text><text start="590.5" dur="5.47">technology right which is applied</text><text start="592.82" dur="5.37">science but it has absolutely no compass</text><text start="595.97" dur="2.94">for how it should do that and not only</text><text start="598.19" dur="3.36">does it have</text><text start="598.91" dur="5.16">no compass it says that all compasses</text><text start="601.55" dur="4.77">are gibberish right because it&apos;s gonna</text><text start="604.07" dur="3.84">be some religious ideas and moral some</text><text start="606.32" dur="4.62">whatever but they&apos;re not science</text><text start="607.91" dur="5.67">they&apos;re not objective and we&apos;ve equated</text><text start="610.94" dur="5.13">objective with real and subjective with</text><text start="613.58" dur="4.35">gibberish and the relationship between</text><text start="616.07" dur="4.32">subjective and object if we don&apos;t even</text><text start="617.93" dur="3.51">really take seriously because we don&apos;t</text><text start="620.39" dur="3.48">know how we don&apos;t have good tools for</text><text start="621.44" dur="4.71">that intellectual tools then we say ok</text><text start="623.87" dur="4.95">well if technology is the power to</text><text start="626.15" dur="4.89">change like to create nuclear bombs that</text><text start="628.82" dur="5.1">can blow up the entire world to</text><text start="631.04" dur="4.53">create all kinds of dystopias or all</text><text start="633.92" dur="3.9">kinds of proto Pia&apos;s right

dur="5.79">because if you look at how some of the</text><text start="1321.03" dur="4.89">what we call primitive tribes looked at</text><text start="1324.06" dur="3.48">themselves and considered

dur="5.07">realize that this sense of separation</text><text start="1364.2" dur="6.09">between self and world is a construct</text><text start="1366.51" dur="5.43">that because we have certain

just</text><text start="1381.48" dur="5.49">intellectually deconstructing it or in</text><text start="1383.43" dur="6.3">deep meditation looking at where like</text><text start="1386.97"

maybe</text><text start="1394.62" dur="6.47">it is because capacity to affect</text><text start="1398.09" dur="5.07">the environment is so much higher now</text><text start="1401.09" dur="3.9">with

the</text><text start="1407.69" dur="4.41">reason why people are so attached to</text><text start="1410.0" dur="3.84">their sense of self because they</text><text start="1412.1" dur="4.29">actually

dur="4.35">you&apos;ve been talking Daniel is this sort</text><text start="1445.7" dur="4.47">of natural experience that people have</text><text start="1447.44" dur="4.71">and how these theories might

dur="5.22">do we communicate these concepts in a</text><text start="1457.07" dur="4.2">way that even though it can conflict</text><text start="1460.04" dur="3.27">with someone&apos;s day to day</text><text start="1461.27" dur="3.48">minute-by-minute experience but I could</text><text start="1463.31" dur="4.05">cause them to think differently and</text><text start="1464.75" dur="4.89">expand their identity but people&apos;s</text><text start="1467.36" dur="4.7">experience is also dictated by their</text><text start="1469.64" dur="5.07">concepts you know like those two things</text><text start="1472.06" dur="4.6">affect each other because when people</text><text start="1474.71" dur="4.65">have an idea about how a certain thing</text><text start="1476.66" dur="5.49">is they tend to experience it in a way</text><text start="1479.36" dur="6.63">that is consistent with that idea mmm</text><text start="1482.15" dur="6.93">true so if we look at the tribes that</text><text start="1485.99" dur="6.51">had more of a there&apos;s a web of life and</text><text start="1489.08" dur="7.74">we&apos;re a strand in it few that we were</text><text start="1492.5" dur="6.3">mentioning long ago they had a informal</text><text start="1496.82" dur="4.26">theory of choice they might have had</text><text start="1498.8" dur="4.35">some moral or ethical principles this</text><text start="1501.08" dur="4.32">was not like a formal systems of</text><text start="1503.15" dur="4.17">formalized ethics but they had some</text><text start="1505.4" dur="4.05">theory and they had a very weak theory</text><text start="1507.32" dur="6.36">of causation they saw diseases happened</text><text start="1509.45" dur="5.97">by like ghosts and obviously didn&apos;t know</text><text start="1513.68" dur="5.79">how to work with tech all that well and</text><text start="1515.42" dur="5.67">etc so they didn&apos;t make it through with</text><text start="1519.47" dur="4.68">other people that understood causation</text><text start="1521.09" dur="6.69">better and so the causation leads to</text><text start="1524.15" dur="5.52">physical adaptive advantage and there&apos;s</text><text start="1527.78" dur="3.18">a theory of choice it&apos;s just a theory of</text><text start="1529.67" dur="2.22">choice called win out win those games</text><text

dur="4.321">every niche and then we made new niches</text><text start="1852.129" dur="5.76">right we made cities and treehouses and</text><text start="1854.44" dur="6.419">all kinds of as a result we had to</text><text start="1857.889" dur="4.5">learn how to adapt to the new world that</text><text start="1860.859" dur="3.87">we were in because we were gonna keep</text><text start="1862.389" dur="4.62">creating new worlds finding and creating</text><text start="1864.729" dur="4.17">new worlds so as babies were born pretty</text><text start="1867.009" dur="4.05">much open to just start

are</text><text start="1894.429" dur="3.99">radically affected by our environments</text><text start="1896.709" dur="3.81">and it&apos;s part of our adaptive advantage</text><text start="1898.419" dur="3.72">and we are mostly affected by our social</text><text start="1900.519" dur="4.08">environments by what the other people</text><text start="1902.139" dur="3.6">around us are paying attention to in</text><text start="1904.599" dur="3.66">doing and what the nature of the</text><text start="1905.739" dur="6.0">relationships are like you&apos;ll notice</text><text start="1908.259" dur="5.22">that mostly now people live in nuclear</text><text start="1911.739" dur="3.27">family homes on their own don&apos;t interact</text><text start="1913.479" dur="3.09">with other people all that much and then</text><text start="1915.009" dur="3.931">they spend all their time addictively</text><text start="1916.569" dur="4.35">looking at other people on screens they</text><text start="1918.94" dur="3.539">watch TV and their watch people and then</text><text start="1920.919" dur="2.94">they go to Facebook and they look at</text><text start="1922.479" dur="3.54">people and they read news articles about</text><text start="1923.859" dur="3.96">people they&apos;re fascinated by</text><text start="1926.019" dur="4.35">people but then we&apos;re conditioned</text><text

dur="3.329">needing each other through money right</text><text start="1938.5" dur="2.789">so the money can just buy whatever I</text><text start="1940.059" dur="3.48">need so I don&apos;t actually have to have</text><text start="1941.289" dur="3.571">friends or neighbors or you know give a</text><text start="1943.539" dur="3.0"> about anybody or have anyone give a</text><text start="1944.86" dur="4.439"> about me and that seems really</text><text start="1946.539" dur="5.461">convenient and everybody is in a crisis</text><text start="1949.299" dur="4.531">of loneliness at home looking at people</text><text start="1952.0" dur="3.87">hoping that they&apos;re getting likes which</text><text start="1953.83" dur="4.05">are not real relationships this is</text><text start="1955.87" dur="4.02">basically sugar rather than nutrients</text><text start="1957.88" dur="4.14">this is porn rather than a real</text><text start="1959.89" dur="5.1">relationship this is a hyper normal</text><text start="1962.02" dur="5.22">stimuli having co-opted real stimuli but</text><text start="1964.99" dur="4.38">also having desensitized us to real</text><text start="1967.24" dur="3.87">stimuli well being comprehensively bad</text><text start="1969.37" dur="3.929">for us so in he&apos;ll asked how could</text><text start="1971.11" dur="5.01">people have a different experience</text><text start="1973.299" dur="5.101">realizing that we are conditioned by our</text><text start="1976.12" dur="3.96">environment to think in words of a</text><text start="1978.4" dur="4.139">certain language to experience in a</text><text start="1980.08" dur="4.53">certain way I could say lots of things</text><text start="1982.539" dur="3.39">that won&apos;t matter I could say go spend</text><text start="1984.61" dur="1.59">more time in nature but nobody will do</text><text start="1985.929" dur="1.74">it</text><text start="1986.2" dur="3.209">we both know other people listen to</text><text start="1987.669" dur="3.541">podcast nobody will do it maybe one time</text><text start="1989.409" dur="3.181">and then their life is busy and they</text><text start="1991.21" dur="4.14">will be the product of their amount</text><text start="1992.59" dur="5.31">again very largely and because the</text><text start="1995.35" dur="4.65">relationship with us here was a tiny</text><text start="1997.9" dur="3.81">part of all of the relationships that</text><text start="2000.0" dur="4.02">were influencing and so I could say go</text><text start="2001.71" dur="3.99">spend time in nature and I could say you</text><text start="2004.02" dur="3.659">have some good psychedelic journeys and</text><text start="2005.7" dur="3.81">you know do this kind of

start="2010.919" dur="4.561">I but there would just be nice words to</text><text start="2013.83" dur="3.57">say that wouldn&apos;t perfecting people that</text><text start="2015.48" dur="3.99">much if you want to ask how could people</text><text start="2017.4" dur="4.23">really change their experience only</text><text start="2019.47" dur="3.839">thing I can say that is statistically</text><text start="2021.63" dur="3.9">really going to work is immerse yourself</text><text start="2023.309" dur="5.401">in an environment that makes that likely</text><text start="2025.53" dur="5.399">around people that are doing them so if</text><text start="2028.71" dur="3.99">you went and lived as a tribe for a</text><text start="2030.929" dur="3.99">while in the Amazon you go live with the</text><text
