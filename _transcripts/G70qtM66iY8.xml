let&apos;s say for instance</text><text start="74.729" dur="8.441">that I was one of the many people that</text><text start="79.54" dur="5.79">got good intelligence back in early</text><text start="83.17" dur="6.39">January about what was happening in</text><text start="85.33" dur="5.52">Wuhan and how many people five to seven</text><text start="89.56" dur="6.989">million people left who hung before</text><text start="90.85" dur="7.44">quarantine and that they got on planes</text><text start="96.549" dur="5.551">not to the rest of China but to the rest</text><text start="98.29" dur="6.21">of the world and what was likely to</text><text start="102.1" dur="5.22">happen from that so we see some senators</text><text start="104.5" dur="6.54">that sold stock in January right but</text><text start="107.32" dur="6.57">that&apos;s a small part like those are</text><text start="111.04" dur="5.1">formal intelligence briefings to people</text><text start="113.89" dur="3.839">who have classified access but the</text><text start="116.14" dur="3.24">private intelligence agencies largely</text><text start="117.729" dur="2.971">work for hedge funds and

dur="7.741">so if I run a hedge fund and I see that</text><text start="128.47" dur="4.109">there&apos;s a situation that could have</text><text start="130.11" dur="3.849">meaningful downturn to the economy but I</text><text start="132.579" dur="1.721">can make money when the economy goes</text><text start="133.959" dur="3.641">down</text><text start="134.3" dur="4.68">and we&apos;re already at the top of a you</text><text start="137.6" dur="2.91">know a stock market that&apos;s probably</text><text start="138.98" dur="2.91">about as high as it can be because the</text><text start="140.51" dur="5.4">underlying economy is actually very</text><text start="141.89" dur="5.52">unhealthy right the total percent of GDP</text><text start="145.91" dur="4.77">that&apos;s going to debt servicing is</text><text start="147.41" dur="6.06">unsustainably high the wealth inequality</text><text start="150.68" dur="5.01">is unsustainably disparate it&apos;s</text><text start="153.47" dur="4.86">basically a power-law distribution you</text><text start="155.69" dur="3.87">have a few companies that make up most</text><text start="158.33" dur="2.88">of the success of the stock market</text><text start="159.56" dur="3.45">because it&apos;s cap-weighted and then</text><text start="161.21" dur="6.0">almost everything else pretty profoundly</text><text start="163.01" dur="7.41">lagging you have a totally unsustainable</text><text start="167.21" dur="4.89">amount of total debt and all of that&apos;s</text><text start="170.42" dur="4.37">resulted in the need for ongoing</text><text start="172.1" dur="6.21">quantitative easing and a negative</text><text start="174.79" dur="7.39">yielding bond market and totally weird</text><text start="178.31" dur="5.55">stuff with that right and so the markets</text><text start="182.18" dur="8.7">not going to keep going up and staying</text><text start="183.86" dur="8.46">that high forever anyways and so being</text><text start="190.88" dur="2.82">able to have that foreknowledge and say</text><text start="192.32" dur="3.81">now is a good time to sell these stocks</text><text start="193.7" dur="4.77">and by the way let&apos;s actually short a</text><text start="196.13" dur="6.06">bunch of stuff to make money as the</text><text start="198.47" dur="5.01">market goes excuse me</text><text start="202.19" dur="5.34">to make money as the market goes down</text><text start="203.48" dur="6.84">and then the value is gonna get really</text><text start="207.53" dur="4.44">low if if airlines can&apos;t fly the price</text><text start="210.32" dur="2.97">of airlines is gonna get really low but</text><text start="211.97" dur="2.7">airlines are a real thing the world&apos;s</text><text start="213.29" dur="3.36">gonna need the value of that sense of</text><text start="214.67" dur="4.2">kind of evaporate so being able to buy</text><text start="216.65" dur="3.68">it up at hugely discounted prices before</text><text start="218.87" dur="4.46">it goes back up is pretty awesome</text><text start="220.33" dur="5.92">opportunity to consolidate power and</text><text start="223.33" dur="4.93">let&apos;s say that I have large pools of</text><text start="226.25" dur="4.709">liquid capital and I haven&apos;t so I&apos;m a</text><text start="228.26" dur="5.07">family office or sovereign wealth fund</text><text start="230.959" dur="4.801">it has been hard to deploy that capital</text><text start="233.33" dur="4.44">very effectively for a while because</text><text start="235.76" dur="3.72">I&apos;ve got negative interest yielding you</text><text start="237.77" dur="5.25">know bond markets I can&apos;t just make</text><text start="239.48" dur="5.52">interest by sitting on it and you know</text><text start="243.02" dur="3.3">there hasn&apos;t been huge volatility of the</text><text start="245.0" dur="3.54">type that could be very effective and</text><text start="246.32" dur="4.02">market stock market prices were high but</text><text start="248.54" dur="4.65">now you can deploy that capital very</text><text start="250.34" dur="4.29">effectively by being

when</text><text start="270.78" dur="3.96">things get worse people become more</text><text start="272.49" dur="5.22">willing to accept solutions that have</text><text start="274.74" dur="4.47">some consequences and so I don&apos;t even</text><text start="277.71" dur="6.69">have to do anything to make it bad I</text><text start="279.21" dur="7.08">simply have to not make it better say</text><text start="284.4" dur="3.96">we&apos;re working on it and bureaucracies</text><text start="286.29" dur="3.65">are slow until we get to the position</text><text start="288.36" dur="5.82">that we actually have the capability to</text><text start="289.94" dur="6.25">do something and so and if I&apos;m trying to</text><text start="294.18" dur="3.48">advance a geopolitical agenda and I</text><text start="296.19" dur="2.82">really want an alliance with these</text><text start="297.66" dur="4.29">countries who are currently allied</text><text start="299.01" dur="5.7">somewhere else and I can just to help</text><text start="301.95" dur="4.82">the situation break those alliances like</text><text start="304.71" dur="4.92">all of those types of things</text><text start="306.77" dur="5.05">I&apos;m not saying anyone did anything I&apos;m</text><text start="309.63" dur="3.81">saying that these are reasonable things</text><text start="311.82" dur="7.73">to understand that there&apos;s an incentive</text><text start="313.44" dur="8.73">landscape for right now someone who</text><text start="319.55" dur="4.48">people who own hedge funds or large</text><text start="322.17" dur="3.51">pools of capital they had the</text><text start="324.03" dur="3.84">intelligence of what was happening could</text><text start="325.68" dur="5.37">they if they wanted to maximally help</text><text start="327.87" dur="5.07">and you know try to start engaging</text><text start="331.05" dur="4.2">solutions and trying to use some of that</text><text start="332.94" dur="3.78">money to influence governments to say</text><text start="335.25" dur="5.04">hey let&apos;s actually put these travel bans</text><text start="336.72" dur="5.49">on sooner and let&apos;s start getting tests</text><text start="340.29" dur="4.35">gets rolled out and PPE distributed and</text><text start="342.21" dur="5.88">etc of course they could and they can</text><text start="344.64" dur="6.33">say it&apos;s not their job and it&apos;s not</text><text start="348.09" dur="5.7">their job right their job is to maximize</text><text start="350.97" dur="4.5">return for the assets under management</text><text start="353.79" dur="3.6">for their shareholders which they do a</text><text start="355.47" dur="4.62">very good job of do I think that&apos;s a</text><text start="357.39" dur="4.89">conspiracy do I think they intended the</text><text start="360.09" dur="6.21">virus no but I think that their</text><text start="362.28" dur="7.91">incentive is to do predatory opportunism</text><text start="366.3" dur="3.89">more than it is to solve the problem</text><text start="371.22" dur="11.57">I think the vast majority of what we&apos;re</text><text start="375.99" dur="11.67">seeing is just predatory opportunism I</text><text start="382.79" dur="9.19">don&apos;t think it&apos;s all just that and so if</text><text start="387.66" dur="7.86">you think about the power law</text><text start="391.98" dur="6.03">distribution of wealth you have a few</text><text start="395.52" dur="4.44">actors who have really just a small</text><text start="398.01" dur="4.08">number like if you look at the House of</text><text start="399.96" dur="4.71">Saud and the House of Rothschild and</text><text start="402.09" dur="5.7">Putin&apos;s personal wealth it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="404.67" dur="8.01">like way above everybody else&apos;s right</text><text start="407.79" dur="6.63">and then you&apos;ve got like a small but</text><text start="412.68" dur="4.11">larger said of a hundred billionaire&apos;s</text><text start="414.42" dur="5.73">and and then it you know kind of Falls</text><text start="416.79" dur="4.8">deeply in the same way that there is a</text><text start="420.15" dur="3.24">power-law distribution and wealth</text><text start="421.59" dur="5.7">there&apos;s a power-law distribution in</text><text start="423.39" dur="8.01">geopolitical power and in hybrid warfare</text><text start="427.29" dur="6.66">power and so the few actors that have</text><text start="431.4" dur="4.11">the most asymmetric capacity habit by</text><text start="433.95" dur="3.69">being good at gaining and maintaining</text><text start="435.51" dur="5.7">asymmetric capacity they didn&apos;t get it</text><text start="437.64" dur="6.12">by like lottery right and so to think</text><text start="441.21" dur="4.89">that the actors that have the most</text><text start="443.76" dur="3.84">asymmetric capacity have it for any</text><text start="446.1" dur="6.15">reason other than they&apos;re the best at</text><text start="447.6" dur="7.1">gaining asymmetric capacity is naive and</text><text start="452.25" dur="7.29">[Music]</text><text start="454.7" dur="7.33">so do those actors have more ability to</text><text start="459.54" dur="4.41">influence the overall landscape to</text><text start="462.03" dur="5.28">continue to advance asymmetric power</text><text start="463.95" dur="7.82">yeah is it guaranteed what will happen</text><text start="467.31" dur="9.48">no it&apos;s a high stakes kind of situation</text><text start="471.77" dur="9.91">so if someone could ask I&apos;m not gonna</text><text start="476.79" dur="10.26">say anything here it&apos;s not relevant</text><text start="481.68" dur="6.93">about specific actors but what I can say</text><text start="487.05" dur="7.71">is if you have any actors that you are</text><text start="488.61" dur="8.28">curious about you just say okay let&apos;s</text><text start="494.76" dur="5.7">make a list starting in whenever</text><text start="496.89" dur="6.079">starting in November or December of the</text><text start="500.46" dur="5.749">things that the w-h-o said</text><text start="502.969" dur="5.28">or the CDC said or whatever group you</text><text start="506.209" dur="4.26">want to look at or President Trump or</text><text start="508.249" dur="3.95">whomever and say look at the things that</text><text start="510.469" dur="6.091">they said in the things that they did</text><text start="512.199" dur="6.52">chronologically in time relative to what</text><text start="516.56" dur="3.87">would have actually been the right thing</text><text start="518.719" dur="4.29">to do and made sense and then just look</text><text start="520.43" dur="5.37">at the Delta between those and then just</text><text start="523.009" dur="5.401">try to explain the Delta some of it</text><text start="525.8" dur="4.709">totally might be incompetence some of it</text><text start="528.41" dur="4.469">totally might be bureaucracy just look</text><text start="530.509" dur="4.741">at does it does that seem to account for</text><text start="532.879" dur="4.231">all of it I mean there are very basic</text><text start="535.25" dur="3.81">examples the w-h-o was telling people</text><text start="537.11" dur="9.599">not to wear PPE until not that long ago</text><text start="539.06" dur="9.509">and Trump was saying this we&apos;ve got this</text><text start="546.709" dur="4.591">solved this isn&apos;t a big deal until it</text><text start="548.569" dur="12.33">was almost overwhelming US cities right</text><text start="551.3" dur="11.61">and Chuck Beijing shut down flights from</text><text start="560.899" dur="3.48">ohan to the rest of China but didn&apos;t</text><text start="562.91" dur="7.049">shut down flights from ohan to the rest</text><text start="564.379" dur="7.5">of the world there are a bunch of</text><text start="569.959" dur="5.6">studies that are in process by major</text><text start="571.879" dur="6.661">public health organizations that are</text><text start="575.559" dur="5.47">looking at the drugs that are currently</text><text start="578.54" dur="5.219">interesting the antivirals but only</text><text start="581.029" dur="4.771">doing late-stage trials of the</text><text start="583.759" dur="7.411">antivirals particularly of antivirals</text><text start="585.8" dur="8.329">that are generic so there&apos;s a there&apos;s</text><text start="591.17" dur="5.13">one particular study that is looking at</text><text start="594.129" dur="4.27">hydroxychloroquine late-stage with</text><text start="596.3" dur="4.889">vitamin C as the placebo I&apos;m not gonna</text><text start="598.399" dur="5.63">say which group it is but it&apos;s easy to</text><text start="601.189" dur="5.491">find out vitamin C is not a placebo</text><text start="604.029" dur="6.73">vitamin C is extremely well established</text><text start="606.68" dur="6.269">for having antiviral benefits actually</text><text start="610.759" dur="5.461">even in late stage more than most</text><text start="612.949" dur="5.25">pharmaceuticals do and one can expect</text><text start="616.22" dur="5.159">that late stage wouldn&apos;t be effective</text><text start="618.199" dur="5.281">anyways so maybe that&apos;s just a dumb</text><text start="621.379" dur="6.661">study maybe it&apos;s just a badly designed</text><text start="623.48" dur="8.609">study but if I wanted to say look Trump</text><text start="628.04" dur="5.609">was an idiot or I wanted to say see this</text><text start="632.089" dur="3.09">generic drug we can&apos;t make any money on</text><text start="633.649" dur="1.911">doesn&apos;t work so this other drug or</text><text start="635.179" dur="4.281">vaccine</text><text start="635.56" dur="6.96">we have is the only option and so I</text><text start="639.46" dur="4.92">wanted to have a particular result come</text><text start="642.52" dur="3.06">out looking like science but it&apos;s</text><text start="644.38" dur="2.49">actually not science because it&apos;s</text><text start="645.58" dur="3.3">science being set up to produce a</text><text start="646.87" dur="7.29">particular result I would consider that</text><text start="648.88" dur="8.55">info warfare pretending to be science is</text><text start="654.16" dur="5.96">it that or not I can say if I wanted to</text><text start="657.43" dur="6.48">do info warfare I would do it that way</text><text start="660.12" dur="5.17">so just because something is a</text><text start="663.91" dur="3.09">randomized control trial done by a</text><text start="665.29" dur="5.97">prestigious university does it mean that</text><text start="667.0" dur="5.74">it&apos;s good information no this is a very</text><text start="671.26" dur="2.84">important topic</text><text start="672.74" dur="3.67">[Music]</text><text start="674.1" dur="4.87">now here&apos;s another important topic</text><text start="676.41" dur="4.72">legitimate Authority legitimate</text><text start="678.97" dur="3.57">Authority very powerful thing right</text><text start="681.13" dur="2.94">because if there is something that seems</text><text start="682.54" dur="6.98">like a source of legitimate Authority</text><text start="684.07" dur="10.38">that can decide what policy should be or</text><text start="689.52" dur="6.52">control public opinion then the power of</text><text start="694.45" dur="3.78">that is such that any group that is</text><text start="696.04" dur="5.49">seeking the power to influence policy or</text><text start="698.23" dur="5.34">control public opinion would have</text><text start="701.53" dur="5.97">maximum incentive to try to influence</text><text start="703.57" dur="5.55">that legitimate Authority and so we have</text><text start="707.5" dur="5.28">no problem seeing this in retrospect</text><text start="709.12" dur="6.93">right we have no problem seeing the way</text><text start="712.78" dur="8.0">that priestly Authority during the</text><text start="716.05" dur="8.28">Middle Ages was very influenced by the</text><text start="720.78" dur="5.23">kings and banks and whatever that we&apos;re</text><text start="724.33" dur="4.41">all basically playing different aspects</text><text start="726.01" dur="5.43">of power games and so whether we&apos;re</text><text start="728.74" dur="4.26">talking about a legitimate Authority</text><text start="731.44" dur="4.2">that comes from a religious source or a</text><text start="733.0" dur="4.589">science source or a one thing that you</text><text start="735.64" dur="3.78">learn about science and this was this is</text><text start="737.589" dur="6.12">kind of a postmodern of critique but not</text><text start="739.42" dur="7.32">quite because there there&apos;s a more</text><text start="743.709" dur="6.621">earnest way to take it the more complex</text><text start="746.74" dur="6.09">this physical system the easier it is to</text><text start="750.33" dur="7.48">very different answers based on how you</text><text start="752.83" dur="6.449">set up the study and so the larger the</text><text start="757.81" dur="4.469">data set is the easier it is to</text><text start="759.279" dur="5.281">cherry-pick data that supports whatever</text><text start="762.279" dur="4.951">I want where it&apos;s actually not lying</text><text start="764.56" dur="3.8">it&apos;s just cherry-picked but similarly if</text><text start="767.23" dur="3.34">I&apos;m looking at</text><text start="768.36" dur="4.95">something as complex as a cell or a body</text><text start="770.57" dur="4.72">there&apos;s no way I can test everything</text><text start="773.31" dur="4.68">that is relevant to that thing right so</text><text start="775.29" dur="4.2">I can say well this particular biometric</text><text start="777.99" dur="3.45">went up and that&apos;s a measure of health</text><text start="779.49" dur="3.87">there might be

start="1185.63" dur="4.02">food situation you get scurvy which is</text><text start="1187.85" dur="4.23">why there are still a lot of kind of</text><text start="1189.65" dur="4.11">mainstream doctors who say you don&apos;t</text><text start="1192.08" dur="4.58">need supplements and nobody really needs</text><text start="1193.76" dur="5.28">vitamin C or vitamin D or whatever this</text><text start="1196.66" dur="4.66">but then you have what is the optimal</text><text start="1199.04" dur="3.96">level for human thriving and the</text><text start="1201.32" dur="3.18">healthiest people with the healthiest</text><text start="1203.0" dur="4.58">diets and there&apos;s a pretty big range</text><text start="1204.5" dur="6.69">between the optimal level and scurvy and</text><text

dur="5.97">actually be and but the deficiency means</text><text start="1216.14" dur="5.16">you are now acutely dying right you are</text><text start="1219.35" dur="4.28">in an acute death process directly</text><text start="1221.3" dur="5.07">related to this one identifiable thing</text><text start="1223.63" dur="4.48">but above that you might be in a you</text><text start="1226.37" dur="3.48">will probably live less long and have</text><text start="1228.11" dur="3.36">increased susceptibility to different</text><text start="1229.85" dur="3.09">kinds of diseases but you&apos;ll never be</text><text start="1231.47" dur="3.24">able to track it to this because it&apos;s</text><text start="1232.94" dur="4.08">your sub clinical level of vitamin C</text><text start="1234.71"

because it</text><text start="1291.35" dur="3.75">doesn&apos;t have a single cause and the</text><text start="1292.76" dur="3.81">cause the many causes aren&apos;t even the</text><text start="1295.1"

so do I</text><text start="1341.96" dur="4.29">think that the safety studies that are</text><text start="1343.64" dur="4.41">done are based on the wrong model of</text><text start="1346.25"

dur="3.93">Declassified stuff that came out in</text><text start="1470.9" dur="3.93">Baltic States I have a friend that runs</text><text start="1473.0" dur="3.12">a private intelligence company who

conspiracy</text><text start="1536.5" dur="10.76">theories that I see are things that I</text><text start="1543.01" dur="7.98">can&apos;t find any good grounding for and</text><text start="1547.26" dur="9.57">they&apos;re like many of them tend to be far</text><text start="1550.99" dur="9.27">more fantastical then just the kind of</text><text start="1556.83" dur="5.709">typical social science of yes of course</text><text start="1560.26" dur="4.32">groups with really big budgets probably</text><text start="1562.539" dur="5.551">have more advanced tech than is publicly</text><text

they&apos;re actually</text><text start="1572.649" dur="8.551">engaged in war and preparation for war</text><text start="1575.38" dur="8.64">and so and yes like the people that get</text><text start="1581.2" dur="4.079">to the top of power stacks get there by</text><text start="1584.02" dur="3.09">being good at getting to the top of</text><text start="1585.279" dur="3.27">power stacks and that means a bunch of</text><text start="1587.11" dur="3.98">things psychologically in the</text><text start="1588.549" dur="4.831">disposition because there will be</text><text start="1591.09" dur="3.939">sociopaths that will want to overturn</text><text start="1593.38" dur="3.63">them and they will only not get</text><text start="1595.029" dur="3.691">overturned by the draconian measures of</text><text start="1597.01" dur="3.81">the sociopaths if they are better at</text><text start="1598.72" dur="3.77">being able to play that game than they</text><text start="1600.82" dur="5.459">are you know we can talk about</text><text start="1602.49" dur="6.4">conspiracy as a function of the system</text><text start="1606.279" dur="4.53">incentives right whatever it is the</text><text start="1608.89" dur="4.5">system incentivizes creates a kind of</text><text start="1610.809" dur="4.85">topology and the people just kind of</text><text start="1613.39" dur="5.19">move within the shape of that topology</text><text start="1615.659" dur="5.351">but then they in turn shape the topology</text><text start="1618.58" dur="5.63">so there&apos;s a there&apos;s a reinforcing thing</text><text start="1621.01" dur="5.43">and one of the problems is that like</text><text start="1624.21" dur="5.8">sociopaths and sadists are a real thing</text><text start="1626.44" dur="5.729">and people who are not that actually</text><text start="1630.01" dur="3.96">have a hard time believing that because</text><text start="1632.169" dur="3.301">they have empathy and they are</text><text start="1633.97" dur="3.03">empathizing with what it must be like to</text><text start="1635.47" dur="3.059">be someone else so they&apos;re getting wrong</text><text start="1637.0" dur="3.179">they have a hard time putting themselves</text><text start="1638.529" dur="3.51">in the position of someone who&apos;s inner</text><text start="1640.179" dur="5.311">experiences is different from theirs as</text><text start="1642.039" dur="6.451">it actually is but you know when you</text><text start="1645.49" dur="4.86">look at cluster B disorders there&apos;s a</text><text start="1648.49" dur="4.77">whole set of disorders that are oriented</text><text start="1650.35" dur="7.799">to power and including abuses of power</text><text start="1653.26" dur="6.539">so there are not one for one and perfect</text><text start="1658.149" dur="2.821">not every time but statistical</text><text start="1659.799" dur="3.691">correlation with</text><text start="1660.97" dur="4.62">of high power and psychologies that are</text><text start="1663.49" dur="3.75">oriented to who want that and that means</text><text start="1665.59" dur="4.14">also differential an asymmetric power</text><text start="1667.24" dur="4.2">meaning use increased power over others</text><text start="1669.73" dur="8.01">to continue to grow and maintain</text><text start="1671.44" dur="8.52">asymmetric power it&apos;s funny how easy it</text><text start="1677.74" dur="4.429">is to see throughout history right like</text><text start="1679.96" dur="4.349">when we&apos;re looking at Genghis Khan or</text><text start="1682.169" dur="4.12">Alexander the Great or Napoleon or</text><text start="1684.309" dur="3.181">whatever we&apos;re like oh yeah the those</text><text start="1686.289" dur="4.081">guys just went and killed</text><text start="1687.49" dur="4.26">everybody right and yet then we look at</text><text start="1690.37" dur="3.059">the people who are most powerful today</text><text start="1691.75" dur="5.28">they&apos;re genetically the same kinds of</text><text start="1693.429" dur="7.081">people who and we have a situation that</text><text start="1697.03" dur="4.769">in some ways seems more civil but also</text><text start="1700.51" dur="4.47">in some ways just because we hide it</text><text start="1701.799" dur="5.911">better you know like we had a nice</text><text start="1704.98" dur="4.53">Democrat and present presidency in the</text><text start="1707.71" dur="7.37">US and we drone strike to a lot of</text><text start="1709.51" dur="14.48">civilians and for very questionable</text><text start="1715.08" dur="8.91">actual motives and and</text><text start="1724.409" dur="4.471">factory farms are as gruesome as</text><text start="1726.76" dur="5.85">anything that was done in the Dark Ages</text><text start="1728.88" dur="5.89">at a massive scale that almost everybody</text><text start="1732.61" dur="6.09">watching this is paying to make that</text><text start="1734.77" dur="6.21">happen right so it&apos;s like oh I didn&apos;t</text><text start="1738.7" dur="4.02">kill her I pay the hit man okay you</text><text start="1740.98" dur="4.199"> paid to have the wet works done</text><text start="1742.72" dur="3.959">well buying something comes from a</text><text start="1745.179" dur="3.0">factory farm is that right you&apos;re like</text><text start="1746.679" dur="6.36">paying someone else to do this kind of</text><text start="1748.179" dur="8.341">gruesome what works and so the reason I</text><text start="1753.039" dur="5.161">say this is because I want to see us</text><text start="1756.52" dur="5.519">emerge into the higher angels of our</text><text start="1758.2" dur="6.24">nature but we can only do that if we can</text><text start="1762.039" dur="4.14">also face the reality of the total set</text><text start="1764.44" dur="4.859">of things that the human experience does</text><text start="1766.179" dur="4.801">and specifically some of the uglier</text><text start="1769.299" dur="9.771">things that it does and the relationship</text><text start="1770.98" dur="11.699">to power that ends up getting and now</text><text start="1779.07" dur="5.41">one can also take that too far take that</text><text start="1782.679" dur="3.511">as a general set of principles and</text><text start="1784.48" dur="4.939">assume that everyone in a position of</text><text start="1786.19" dur="6.7">power is a child eating say this</text><text start="1789.419" dur="5.631">Satanist which would also be silly</text><text start="1792.89" dur="4.71">and this is one of the things that I</text><text start="1795.05" dur="6.45">find with regard to conspiracy is I find</text><text start="1797.6" dur="6.57">that people have an aesthetic bias where</text><text start="1801.5" dur="5.61">anything they hear as a conspiracy they</text><text start="1804.17" dur="4.68">either just kind of reject it up front</text><text start="1807.11" dur="3.69">off tinfoil hat conspiracy</text><text start="1808.85" dur="3.57">theorists they just automatically</text><text start="1810.8" dur="3.15">without studying it even though history</text><text start="1812.42" dur="4.2">shows how much people have conspired</text><text start="1813.95" dur="4.32">just meaning some people share info with</text><text start="1816.62" dur="3.03">each other to advance shared agendas</text><text start="1818.27" dur="3.84">without sharing it with the public and</text><text start="1819.65" dur="4.68">sharing some disinfo you can go back to</text><text start="1822.11" dur="3.66">Sun Tzu and read about this info and how</text><text start="1824.33" dur="3.65">to do this info right like we&apos;ve been</text><text start="1825.77" dur="8.37">doing that for a thousand years pretty</text><text start="1827.98" dur="7.99">intelligently and coordinated Lee and so</text><text start="1834.14" dur="3.96">it&apos;s interesting how easy it is for</text><text start="1835.97" dur="3.42">people to reject something as oh that&apos;s</text><text start="1838.1" dur="4.32">dumb conspiracy thinking when you</text><text start="1839.39" dur="4.77">actually study history then on the other</text><text start="1842.42" dur="3.51">hand there are people who if they hear</text><text start="1844.16" dur="3.87">any conspiracy they assume it&apos;s probably</text><text start="1845.93" dur="4.92">true and if they hear that anything came</text><text start="1848.03" dur="4.86">from a authoritative institution they</text><text start="1850.85" dur="3.81">assume it&apos;s probably corrupt and that&apos;s</text><text start="1852.89" dur="3.03">also completely silly because if the</text><text start="1854.66" dur="2.49">groups were that corrupt they would be</text><text start="1855.92" dur="3.36">overturned like if they were that</text><text start="1857.15" dur="5.01">completely in whole-cell corrupt or is a</text><text start="1859.28" dur="4.92">there&apos;s a balance of that it&apos;s not just</text><text start="1862.16" dur="4.08">evilness that gets them there it&apos;s also</text><text start="1864.2" dur="3.57">effectiveness at a lot of things right</text><text start="1866.24" dur="3.48">it is actually the ability to produce</text><text start="1867.77" dur="3.72">and manage and do logistics and the</text><text start="1869.72" dur="5.07">ability to win power games it&apos;s a mix of</text><text start="1871.49" dur="5.07">those things right so is everything</text><text start="1874.79" dur="3.51">coming out of a major university or</text><text start="1876.56" dur="5.85">major institution or you know government</text><text start="1878.3" dur="9.06">regulatory body a lying conspiracy no is</text><text start="1882.41" dur="7.41">a lot of it at least highly influenced</text><text start="1887.36" dur="4.56">yeah does that mean that most of the</text><text start="1889.82" dur="4.14">people who are involved even no no of</text><text start="1891.92" dur="6.51">course not most of the people involved</text><text start="1893.96" dur="6.24">are just doing their job and they were</text><text start="1898.43" dur="3.75">told to research this so they&apos;re doing a</text><text start="1900.2" dur="3.0">good job of doing honest research on</text><text start="1902.18" dur="2.76">this now the fact that they&apos;re</text><text start="1903.2" dur="3.33">researching this as opposed to this and</text><text start="1904.94" dur="3.27">that there&apos;s an agenda as to why to</text><text start="1906.53" dur="4.97">research this as opposed to that they</text><text start="1908.21" dur="3.29">will never even know that that agenda</text><text start="1911.65" dur="8.61">what this means though is that almost</text><text start="1914.18" dur="9.15">everyone lives in in a topology that is</text><text start="1920.26" dur="4.36">you know like what do I do for job</text><text start="1923.33" dur="2.79">protection there are certain things that</text><text start="1924.62" dur="1.77">like there&apos;s stuff I&apos;m not going to say</text><text start="1926.12" dur="1.8">be</text><text start="1926.39" dur="3.42">I&apos;ll lose my job there&apos;s certain stuff I</text><text start="1927.92" dur="3.33">have to say and I have to do to just</text><text start="1929.81" dur="3.27">keep my job I got to take care of my</text><text start="1931.25" dur="3.6">family so whatever it is even if it</text><text start="1933.08" dur="3.09">seems kind of unethical or ish</text><text start="1934.85" dur="3.51">or not the thing I&apos;d most like to do</text><text start="1936.17" dur="6.75">it&apos;s office policy or whatever so just</text><text start="1938.36" dur="8.58">for job security and then for promotion</text><text start="1942.92" dur="5.91">and for ladder climbing I am gonna do</text><text start="1946.94" dur="4.32">the thing that&apos;s effective within that</text><text start="1948.83" dur="4.68">space so basically the incentives and</text><text start="1951.26" dur="4.32">the disincentives the topology of that</text><text start="1953.51" dur="6.15">space is going to inform my action as a</text><text start="1955.58" dur="7.47">average agent in that space but some</text><text start="1959.66" dur="8.88">people have asymmetric influence on the</text><text start="1963.05" dur="6.81">architecture of those topologies and so</text><text start="1968.54" dur="3.3">one of the things that I think most</text><text start="1969.86" dur="4.68">people don&apos;t think about enough is that</text><text start="1971.84" dur="5.55">a relatively small amount of fairly</text><text start="1974.54" dur="5.79">sociopathic people can create topologies</text><text start="1977.39" dur="6.54">that lots of otherwise not sociopathic</text><text start="1980.33" dur="6.57">people will participate in towards</text><text start="1983.93" dur="12.11">relatively sociopathic results so let&apos;s</text><text start="1986.9" dur="12.21">say that profit becomes a motive for war</text><text start="1996.04" dur="5.85">if you study history again the idea that</text><text start="1999.11" dur="4.94">that&apos;s a thing becomes pretty clear and</text><text start="2001.89" dur="4.3">when you look at the size that</text><text start="2004.05" dur="4.0">military-industrial complex is out of</text><text start="2006.19" dur="3.0">the total economic bloc and the size of</text><text start="2008.05" dur="3.18">the government contracts it gets</text><text start="2009.19" dur="3.87">compared to other areas whenever the</text><text start="2011.23" dur="4.02">fact that if the demand went away the</text><text start="2013.06" dur="4.77">the profit of the supply side would go</text><text start="2015.25" dur="4.56">away and it is actually the fiduciary</text><text start="2017.83" dur="7.02">responsibility of all business owners to</text><text start="2019.81" dur="6.63">continue to manufacture demand we can go</text><text start="2024.85" dur="3.12">back and historically look at cases</text><text start="2026.44" dur="3.12">right we can look at gulf of tonkin or</text><text start="2027.97" dur="4.29">whatever where there were false flag</text><text start="2029.56" dur="4.53">events for whatever motives so let&apos;s say</text><text start="2032.26" dur="3.66">there&apos;s some up motives that some</text><text start="2034.09" dur="3.6">very small number of people have that</text><text start="2035.92" dur="3.03">end up influencing other people and the</text><text start="2037.69" dur="3.87">other people are not necessarily even</text><text start="2038.95" dur="7.35">aware of what those motives are the</text><text start="2041.56" dur="6.93">soldier who is in the battlefield isn&apos;t</text><text start="2046.3" dur="3.869">fighting for financial interest who&apos;s</text><text start="2048.49" dur="4.98">risking his life and making a relatively</text><text start="2050.169" dur="7.621">low wage but he still might be doing</text><text start="2053.47" dur="6.51">something that is when he is involved in</text><text start="2057.79" dur="4.2">the in the bombing or the whatever</text><text start="2059.98" dur="4.05">still might be killing civilians for</text><text start="2061.99" dur="3.27">Wars it should never be fought and he</text><text start="2064.03" dur="4.32">just doesn&apos;t even know that right so</text><text start="2065.26" dur="5.75">he&apos;s engaged in an overall in activity</text><text start="2068.35" dur="5.46">that we could call sociopathic activity</text><text start="2071.01" dur="5.409">for non sociopathic reasons personally</text><text start="2073.81" dur="3.99">and we can see the same thing in the</text><text start="2076.419" dur="5.121">corporate world we can see the same</text><text start="2077.8" dur="6.51">thing in all over the place this was the</text><text start="2081.54" dur="5.319">SS troupe who were being tried in the</text><text start="2084.31" dur="4.71">Nuremberg trials and how many of them</text><text start="2086.859" dur="3.871">said no we actually didn&apos;t believe</text><text start="2089.02" dur="3.48">everything we were doing was good it</text><text start="2090.73" dur="3.12">started out with some ideological stuff</text><text start="2092.5" dur="2.369">and then it got really up and</text><text start="2093.85" dur="3.059">then when they were asked did you tried</text><text start="2094.869" dur="3.781">to stop no and they all repeated the</text><text start="2096.909" dur="3.261">same German phrases that basically said</text><text start="2098.65" dur="6.24">officers orders we didn&apos;t have a

dur="5.221">thing they don&apos;t even make it obvious or</text><text start="2110.859" dur="3.75">they have some fucked-up motives and</text><text start="2112.33" dur="4.11">they create a set of office policies or</text><text start="2114.609" dur="3.241">command and control policies or whatever</text><text start="2116.44" dur="3.419">it is and everyone else just kind of</text><text

for a</text><text start="2127.119" dur="7.381">weaponized purpose inside of military or</text><text start="2129.13" dur="8.07">whatever and then there&apos;s also that if</text><text start="2134.5"

dur="4.32">yeah it&apos;s totally compelling for me that</text><text start="2476.8" dur="4.23">there is that many of them describing</text><text start="2478.36" dur="3.9">some kinds of phenomena does that mean I</text><text start="2481.03" dur="5.94">get to jump to knowing what the</text><text start="2482.26" dur="6.06">phenomena are nope does that mean there</text><text start="2486.97"

a</text><text start="2494.2" dur="5.7">clear sense that it is or I can for sure</text><text start="2496.84" dur="5.28">rule it out I can say that a lot of</text><text start="2499.9" dur="5.73">people

start="2525.13" dur="2.9">out where I would</text><text start="2531.78" dur="4.3">do I think that there are people that</text><text start="2534.04" dur="4.29">are airing on the side of unfounded</text><text start="2536.08" dur="4.86">conspiracy theories and more of them</text><text start="2538.33" dur="4.98">together and with more certain teams yes</text><text start="2540.94" dur="4.08">definitely do I think there are also</text><text start="2543.31" dur="3.92">other people airing on the side of being</text><text start="2545.02" dur="5.16">comfortable with more authoritarianism</text><text start="2547.23" dur="4.84">like the exact opposite side it totally</text><text start="2550.18" dur="6.99">shouldn&apos;t be that are actually under</text><text start="2552.07" dur="6.3">paranoid about what the true authorities</text><text start="2557.17" dur="3.33">are telling them and how they will</text><text start="2558.37" dur="3.69">handle things yeah I totally think that</text><text start="2560.5" dur="6.36">both of those are happening nearly</text><text start="2562.06" dur="5.88">equally and equally concerning lis no</text><text start="2566.86" dur="3.54">I&apos;m actually more concerned by the</text><text start="2567.94" dur="5.52">second one honestly I think that there&apos;s</text><text start="2570.4" dur="5.13">a problem with people saying that they</text><text start="2573.46" dur="3.93">think that there isn&apos;t really a virus</text><text start="2575.53" dur="5.01">they can absolutely up endemic up</text><text start="2577.39" dur="7.08">of that belief but I think the other</text><text start="2580.54" dur="6.03">people who call for national security</text><text start="2584.47" dur="5.49">actions to solve this that leave</text><text start="2586.57" dur="5.1">authority states also creates a problem</text><text start="2589.96" dur="3.78">that could be worse than the virus I</text><text start="2591.67" dur="5.46">think there&apos;s another reason that people</text><text start="2593.74" dur="6.51">are kind of having that increasing sense</text><text start="2597.13" dur="5.25">is that there are a lot of increasing</text><text start="2600.25" dur="4.26">authoritarian measures happening which</text><text start="2602.38" dur="3.69">is legitimately concerning and should be</text><text start="2604.51" dur="7.44">for anyone who has paid attention to</text><text start="2606.07" dur="7.29">history and I think a lot of people do</text><text start="2611.95" dur="3.15">have the awareness that even if</text><text start="2613.36" dur="6.81">something wasn&apos;t intended as a grand</text><text start="2615.1" dur="8.36">plot that opportunism is a thing and I</text><text start="2620.17" dur="7.58">don&apos;t think that most people think that</text><text start="2623.46" dur="7.84">Facebook and Google want everyone&apos;s data</text><text start="2627.75" dur="6.13">for their good you know for everyone&apos;s</text><text start="2631.3" dur="4.08">good like they they commercialize the</text><text start="2633.88" dur="3.63"> out of that data in ways that do</text><text start="2635.38" dur="4.08">not necessarily improve the lives of the</text><text start="2637.51" dur="3.12">people and sometimes like like they&apos;re</text><text start="2639.46" dur="7.8">actually turning the people into a</text><text start="2640.63" dur="9.81">commodity the other thing is that when</text><text start="2647.26" dur="6.69">you see developing nations respond</text><text start="2650.44" dur="6.14">better than the US which has happened</text><text start="2653.95" dur="3.75">for a number of them and when you see</text><text start="2656.58" dur="3.52">mmm</text><text start="2657.7" dur="5.48">when you see Vietnam responding better</text><text start="2660.1" dur="3.08">right and</text><text start="2663.73" dur="7.8">some Latin American countries and</text><text start="2665.68" dur="8.22">whatever and you see how far ahead we</text><text start="2671.53" dur="3.72">knew this was a thing and you see the</text><text start="2673.9" dur="2.88">intelligence briefings that were there</text><text start="2675.25" dur="3.66">and the lack of response and you know</text><text start="2676.78" dur="5.819">what the logistical capabilities of the</text><text start="2678.91" dur="6.57">of the US military and DOD that wouldn&apos;t</text><text start="2682.599" dur="5.391">even have to override anyone&apos;s freedom</text><text start="2685.48" dur="4.859">to just offer logistical support our and</text><text start="2687.99" dur="3.579">you know how much damage is happening to</text><text start="2690.339" dur="2.46">the economy and how much cheaper it</text><text start="2691.569" dur="3.421">would have been to actually do upfront</text><text start="2692.799" dur="4.411">work and the fact that there weren&apos;t</text><text start="2694.99" dur="3.75">tests and that by the time we had got</text><text start="2697.21" dur="3.149">our first hundred thousand tests out</text><text start="2698.74" dur="3.119">Germany had been doing five hundred</text><text start="2700.359" dur="4.591">thousand a week for a long time with a</text><text start="2701.859" dur="4.621">tiny percentage of population there&apos;s so</text><text start="2704.95" dur="5.909">much of that that a lot of people are</text><text start="2706.48" dur="7.23">like is that just incompetence like it&apos;s</text><text start="2710.859" dur="6.031">almost mind-blowing to imagine that</text><text start="2713.71" dur="4.859">that&apos;s just incompetence given that we</text><text start="2716.89" dur="4.65">have so much actual competence</text><text start="2718.569" dur="4.74">like the if there&apos;s anything the US</text><text start="2721.54" dur="5.94">military is really good at like it&apos;s</text><text start="2723.309" dur="7.74">really good at logistics and it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="2727.48" dur="5.49">have to be deployed in a way that</text><text start="2731.049" dur="3.991">overrides any civil liberties to simply</text><text start="2732.97" dur="3.72">be deployed to support stuff to support</text><text start="2735.04" dur="2.97">supply chains and get PPE where it&apos;s</text><text start="2736.69" dur="5.34">supposed to go and why wasn&apos;t that</text><text start="2738.01" dur="7.74">why didn&apos;t happen why didn&apos;t we get you</text><text start="2742.03" dur="5.819">know and when you look at Germany and</text><text start="2745.75" dur="3.54">its testing or you look at Hong Kong and</text><text start="2747.849" dur="2.821">the way it shut the borders down you</text><text start="2749.29" dur="2.819">look at the way South Korea rolled it</text><text start="2750.67" dur="5.24">out as a democracy or you look at the</text><text start="2752.109" dur="7.411">way Iceland did you look at this and so</text><text start="2755.91" dur="7.149">and then when you also look at well why</text><text start="2759.52" dur="5.339">the did Beijing not let anyone fly</text><text start="2763.059" dur="3.361">from Wuhan to the rest of China but they</text><text start="2764.859" dur="3.781">did let them fly from wander the rest of</text><text start="2766.42" dur="4.169">the world and a number of other very</text><text start="2768.64" dur="10.38">strange things about the flows of PPE</text><text start="2770.589" dur="13.47">and stuff like that I think that people</text><text start="2779.02" dur="7.14">will jump to the wrong theory but</text><text start="2784.059" dur="6.181">sometimes because of a right intuition</text><text start="2786.16" dur="6.33">and the right intuition is there are</text><text start="2790.24" dur="4.94">some agents benefiting from this and I</text><text start="2792.49" dur="2.69">don&apos;t feel good about it</text><text start="2795.19" dur="3.87">and then a rather than being able to sit</text><text start="2797.68" dur="4.59">with the uncertainty long enough to do</text><text start="2799.06" dur="4.98">the right kind of research so like did</text><text start="2802.27" dur="4.11">Trump get this wrong for a long time in</text><text start="2804.04" dur="5.9">terms of saying oh there&apos;s no big deal</text><text start="2806.38" dur="5.76">we got it handled whatever yes totally</text><text start="2809.94" dur="4.179">does that mean he&apos;s driving the whole</text><text start="2812.14" dur="4.26">thing for some agenda for himself super</text><text start="2814.119" dur="5.22">effectively and it&apos;s really because he</text><text start="2816.4" dur="4.89">owns shares in the hydroxychloroquine</text><text start="2819.339" dur="3.75">company and that&apos;s why he said it well I</text><text start="2821.29" dur="5.7">would say that that&apos;s not very good</text><text start="2823.089" dur="7.02">conspiracy investigation the fact that</text><text start="2826.99" dur="4.44">he owns some shares in a financial</text><text start="2830.109" dur="2.851">services company I think it&apos;s like a</text><text start="2831.43" dur="3.51">mutual fund or something we&apos;re doing</text><text start="2832.96" dur="3.57">some shares in a company that produces</text><text start="2834.94" dur="3.09">hydroxychloroquine which is a generic</text><text start="2836.53" dur="3.21">which means that it doesn&apos;t have a</text><text start="2838.03" dur="3.24">patent on and lots of companies can</text><text start="2839.74" dur="4.68">produce it and there&apos;s not much money to</text><text start="2841.27" dur="4.829">be made on it yeah like you don&apos;t do</text><text start="2844.42" dur="5.07">really good conspiracies for like a few</text><text start="2846.099" dur="4.681">bucks you you could have to you have to</text><text start="2849.49" dur="3.57">do something better than that so that&apos;s</text><text start="2850.78" dur="4.23">just like a follow the money trail but</text><text start="2853.06" dur="2.88">not not that money trail right that just</text><text start="2855.01" dur="4.109">doesn&apos;t look like a particular good</text><text start="2855.94" dur="4.649">money trail so actually the main thing I</text><text start="2859.119" dur="3.361">want with conspiracy theorist is that</text><text start="2860.589" dur="3.721">they get better at it did they get</text><text start="2862.48" dur="5.25">better at actually studying history and</text><text start="2864.31" dur="5.66">settings physiology and being able to</text><text start="2867.73" dur="6.74">actually check facts and follow</text><text start="2869.97"

this is</text><text start="2961.39" dur="4.83">where people have to be careful if they</text><text start="2964.39" dur="4.68">actually want to try to do sense-making</text><text start="2966.22"

much of</text><text start="2973.119" dur="3.99">a what are the different answers that it</text><text start="2975.58" dur="3.96">could be here and let&apos;s run all of them</text><text

this or if this</text><text start="2985.359" dur="3.481">was true what other things would be true</text><text start="2986.92" dur="3.09">that I can look for if this was false</text><text

the</text><text start="3002.07" dur="5.279">bad response and those guys but we</text><text start="3005.82" dur="2.97">just need to band together and kind of</text><text start="3007.349" dur="3.871">help our political party win this next</text><text start="3008.79" dur="4.47">time and solve the virus and whatever</text><text start="3011.22" dur="9.09">and in a national participation the</text><text start="3013.26" dur="9.18">certainty of that or the certainty of we</text><text start="3020.31" dur="3.87">know the cabal that is organizing this</text><text start="3022.44"

that I find</text><text start="3031.77" dur="6.0">interesting is there there&apos;s lots of</text><text start="3034.97" dur="4.45">nuance so I&apos;m gonna oversimplify but I</text><text start="3037.77" dur="4.43">definitely see people that have a</text><text start="3039.42" dur="5.58">towards or away from conspiracy bias</text><text start="3042.2" dur="6.75">that corresponds with their general bias</text><text start="3045.0" dur="6.69">of how they relate to authorities and</text><text start="3048.95" dur="4.419">like I said I&apos;m oversimplifying but the</text><text start="3051.69" dur="3.56">oversimplification is a starting place</text><text start="3053.369" dur="5.671">for me</text><text start="3055.25" dur="4.66">and I&apos;m gonna even postulate where this</text><text start="3059.04" dur="3.63">comes from</text><text start="3059.91" dur="5.61">but again not all the time this this is</text><text start="3062.67" dur="4.02">a pattern that we can observe enough of</text><text start="3065.52" dur="3.87">the time that it&apos;s interesting to look</text><text start="3066.69" dur="4.11">at the reason I&apos;m careful with saying</text><text start="3069.39" dur="3.12">things like that is because when someone</text><text start="3070.8" dur="2.76">over norms their patterns that&apos;s one of</text><text start="3072.51" dur="10.52">the places that their sense making</text><text start="3073.56" dur="13.58">becomes bad I have seen relatively often</text><text start="3083.03" dur="7.06">people who generally think that</text><text start="3087.14" dur="5.14">government bodies are kind of lame and</text><text start="3090.09" dur="3.36">ossified whatever but mostly regulate in</text><text start="3092.28" dur="3.21">the right interests you can largely</text><text start="3093.45" dur="5.46">trust authorities the universities</text><text start="3095.49" dur="5.97">mostly say true stuff whatever things</text><text start="3098.91" dur="4.23">those people the generous authorities</text><text start="3101.46" dur="4.71">also generally have a frame that things</text><text start="3103.14" dur="5.28">are mostly getting better in the world</text><text start="3106.17" dur="4.43">right now a lot less people have that</text><text start="3108.42" dur="6.48">frame but in general that frame and</text><text start="3110.6" dur="8.4">generally not always those people did</text><text start="3114.9" dur="7.35">better in childhood like at school in</text><text start="3119.0" dur="4.63">sports they&apos;re oftentimes their parents</text><text start="3122.25" dur="3.359">were either more success or they did</text><text start="3123.63" dur="3.27">better relative to them so they had this</text><text start="3125.609" dur="3.031">experience that the system actually</text><text start="3126.9" dur="4.5">works for me and that the authorities</text><text start="3128.64" dur="7.86">are are actually trustworthy and I have</text><text start="3131.4" dur="7.14">a good relationship with him and that</text><text start="3136.5" dur="3.66">creates a kind of intuitive felt sense</text><text start="3138.54" dur="4.23">so it&apos;s so kind of like the symbol</text><text start="3140.16" dur="3.57">grounding felt sense where then even if</text><text start="3142.77" dur="2.339">they&apos;re in another environment where</text><text start="3143.73" dur="2.61">that&apos;s not true and it was true in the</text><text start="3145.109" dur="3.121">little micro environment of their</text><text start="3146.34" dur="5.88">childhood that&apos;s still the felt sense</text><text start="3148.23" dur="5.52">and then they sometimes will keep that</text><text start="3152.22" dur="4.38">forever or they have to be disabused of</text><text start="3153.75" dur="5.49">it somewhat painfully at some point now</text><text start="3156.6" dur="3.9">other people who have the general sense</text><text start="3159.24" dur="6.77">that most authorities are probably</text><text start="3160.5" dur="8.369">corrupt and probably abusing power and</text><text start="3166.01" dur="4.96">that most institutions can&apos;t be trusted</text><text start="3168.869" dur="5.25">and that people with less power can be</text><text start="3170.97" dur="5.61">more trusted and that there is usually</text><text start="3174.119" dur="5.181">some process of corruption that is</text><text start="3176.58" dur="5.07">required for climbing power ladders</text><text start="3179.3" dur="3.97">those people generally weren&apos;t very</text><text start="3181.65" dur="6.38">successful at climbing the ladders early</text><text start="3183.27" dur="7.43">and often times had authorities</text><text start="3188.03" dur="4.14">that abused power or that were like</text><text start="3190.7" dur="2.94">negative experience with them whether it</text><text start="3192.17" dur="3.6">was parents or school or church or</text><text start="3193.64" dur="4.14">whatever it was not always but I&apos;m</text><text start="3195.77" dur="6.36">giving an example of a kind of bias that</text><text start="3197.78" dur="6.78">can occur which is a towards or against</text><text start="3202.13" dur="4.62">Authority bias a kind of result that can</text><text start="3204.56" dur="3.75">happen more likely to believe in</text><text start="3206.75" dur="3.33">conspiracies that the authorities are</text><text start="3208.31" dur="4.17">bad or more likely to reject that the</text><text start="3210.08" dur="3.81">authorities are bad and they kind of</text><text start="3212.48" dur="2.58">developmental environment that could</text><text start="3213.89" dur="2.73">give rise to it there&apos;s other</text><text start="3215.06" dur="2.94">developmental environments could give</text><text start="3216.62" dur="4.14">rise to it and there&apos;s other biases</text><text start="3218.0" dur="8.85">involved in conspiracy but just one</text><text start="3220.76" dur="8.76">example of a developmental pathway as</text><text start="3226.85" dur="4.71">far as the sentence making for the</text><text start="3229.52" dur="3.78">ongoing covert situation goes another</text><text start="3231.56" dur="4.68">principle that I&apos;ll share that I think</text><text start="3233.3" dur="4.83">is helpful and it will help you notice</text><text start="3236.24" dur="3.09">where you&apos;re it&apos;ll it&apos;ll help you make</text><text start="3238.13" dur="5.55">sense better but it&apos;ll also I hope you</text><text start="3239.33" dur="6.2">notice where your own biases are is if</text><text start="3243.68" dur="7.83">you read something that seems compelling</text><text start="3245.53" dur="9.0">on a particular idea like that immunity</text><text start="3251.51" dur="8.57">is conferred or immunity isn&apos;t convert</text><text start="3254.53" dur="9.01">try to find things that say the opposite</text><text start="3260.08" dur="6.19">that also seem the best thought out</text><text start="3263.54" dur="4.74">there are and see if you understand the</text><text start="3266.27" dur="6.39">arguments well enough to be able to</text><text start="3268.28" dur="15.57">parse the difference and if not don&apos;t</text><text start="3272.66" dur="13.59">hold a strong view on the topic so hey</text><text start="3283.85" dur="3.99">the only way to get through this is herd</text><text start="3286.25" dur="3.27">immunity that&apos;s the way that respiratory</text><text start="3287.84" dur="3.57">viruses work so we need to keep the</text><text start="3289.52" dur="3.87">elderly inside let everybody else go</text><text start="3291.41" dur="3.24">outside it&apos;ll be fine there won&apos;t be</text><text start="3293.39" dur="3.03">that many deaths because it&apos;s really</text><text start="3294.65" dur="3.54">mostly only for the elderly and</text><text start="3296.42" dur="3.21">immunocompromised and the only way we</text><text start="3298.19" dur="1.89">get through respiratory viruses is herd</text><text start="3299.63" dur="3.75">immunity</text><text start="3300.08" dur="4.92">we&apos;ve all heard some epidemiologist or</text><text start="3303.38" dur="8.1">pathologist or somebody say pretty</text><text start="3305.0" dur="8.7">confidently that well are there some</text><text start="3311.48" dur="5.1">viruses that we don&apos;t get hurt immunity</text><text start="3313.7" dur="4.32">to and we just really try to do</text><text start="3316.58" dur="3.729">everything we can to stop their</text><text start="3318.02" dur="5.21">transmission yeah totally</text><text start="3320.309" dur="9.161">which one is this we don&apos;t know yet</text><text start="3323.23" dur="8.91">and does it seem like a meaningful</text><text start="3329.47" dur="5.089">percentage of the people who get</text><text start="3332.14" dur="5.189">infected don&apos;t produce antibodies is</text><text start="3334.559" dur="5.05">there good evidence that people who are</text><text start="3337.329" dur="5.671">showing cleared are getting reinfected</text><text start="3339.609" dur="7.76">is that reinfected or is it a resurgence</text><text start="3343.0" dur="6.839">or was it a false test does it seem like</text><text start="3347.369" dur="5.891">in the studies coming out of China that</text><text start="3349.839" dur="5.52">older people are producing 3 to 5x the</text><text start="3353.26" dur="3.45">antibodies of younger people which seems</text><text start="3355.359" dur="2.67">to be the opposite of what we&apos;d expect</text><text start="3356.71" dur="3.599">which makes us question what those</text><text start="3358.029" dur="4.921">antibodies will do will they will they</text><text start="3360.309" dur="4.56">protect against getting it again where</text><text start="3362.95" dur="3.78">you won&apos;t get it at all will they</text><text start="3364.869" dur="3.66">protect where you still get it but it&apos;s</text><text start="3366.73" dur="3.629">less severe or might they actually prime</text><text start="3368.529" dur="5.82">a more severe response that happens with</text><text start="3370.359" dur="5.581">some things like thank-you fever given</text><text start="3374.349" dur="2.96">that people who die are actually dying</text><text start="3375.94" dur="4.47">of excessive immune response right</text><text start="3377.309" dur="6.97">cytokine storm responses or that a lot</text><text start="3380.41" dur="4.98">of evidence of that if the antibodies</text><text start="3384.279" dur="8.55">are conferred how long will they last</text><text start="3385.39" dur="9.33">and given the decay rate on them and how</text><text start="3392.829" dur="3.811">much can we infer from other</text><text start="3394.72" dur="6.889">coronaviruses about this which is a</text><text start="3396.64" dur="10.56">novel one and you know you see different</text><text start="3401.609" dur="7.42">virologists saying this is not mutating</text><text start="3407.2" dur="3.81">anywhere near as fast as influenza and</text><text start="3409.029" dur="4.621">doesn&apos;t have the same recombinant oriole</text><text start="3411.01" dur="3.87">dynamics it&apos;s probably if we come up</text><text start="3413.65" dur="4.83">with a vaccine or people get immune</text><text start="3414.88" dur="4.709">it&apos;ll be against it&apos;ll be good and then</text><text start="3418.48" dur="3.51">other ones saying no there&apos;s actually</text><text start="3419.589" dur="4.5">reasons to think that there&apos;s going to</text><text start="3421.99" dur="5.28">be a follow-up round at least one and</text><text start="3424.089" dur="5.671">it&apos;ll probably be more pathogenic before</text><text start="3427.27" dur="5.25">you decide which of those you believe</text><text start="3429.76" dur="4.23">make sure that you study the dialectic</text><text start="3432.52" dur="3.299">well enough and understand it well</text><text start="3433.99"
