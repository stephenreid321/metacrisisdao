am</text><text start="7.29" dur="5.28">here with Daniel Shmack Tim burger and</text><text start="9.53" dur="5.05">dude you were the guy that showed up on</text><text start="12.57" dur="4.41">my feed when I started researching the</text><text start="14.58" dur="4.44">end of the world which is a pretty</text><text start="16.98" dur="4.92">fascinating thing to become known for</text><text start="19.02" dur="4.65">and I&apos;m super curious how did you you</text><text start="21.9" dur="3.51">you&apos;ve touched so many different things</text><text start="23.67" dur="4.05">from the neuro hacker hacker collective</text><text start="25.41" dur="4.5">and self optimization and actually</text><text start="27.72" dur="4.379">creating businesses how did you end up</text><text start="29.91" dur="4.23">getting so deep into civilizations and</text><text start="32.099" dur="4.471">how they fall apart what a good</text><text start="34.14" dur="5.669">civilization is and how to improve</text><text start="36.57" dur="4.86">things in our world I would say was my</text><text start="39.809" dur="4.201">interest since I was young and kind of</text><text start="41.43" dur="4.59">the center line so how to improve how</text><text start="44.01" dur="3.779">young are we talking while I was very</text><text start="46.02" dur="3.84">fortunate to be homeschooled growing up</text><text start="47.789" dur="3.421">and homeschooled in a way that&apos;s closer</text><text start="49.86" dur="2.82">to what people would call unschooling</text><text start="51.21" dur="3.45">now or I didn&apos;t have a fixed curriculum</text><text start="52.68" dur="4.8">so I got to study what I wanted and so</text><text start="54.66" dur="4.14">seeing the things that seemed like the</text><text start="57.48" dur="2.7">biggest problems in the world and</text><text start="58.8" dur="3.21">finding out why are these things like</text><text start="60.18" dur="4.92">this was actually what got to be my</text><text start="62.01" dur="4.98">curriculum so very now are were you</text><text start="65.1" dur="4.86">taught by your parents or did they have</text><text start="66.99" dur="5.52">give you access to actual teachers my</text><text start="69.96" dur="3.81">parents facilitated and sometimes I&apos;d go</text><text start="72.51" dur="2.76">to a public school or a private school</text><text start="73.77" dur="3.12">for a while but they were very actively</text><text start="75.27" dur="3.75">engaged in how I was processing the</text><text start="76.89" dur="3.51">information and then other times finding</text><text start="79.02" dur="3.51">tutors and other times just working with</text><text start="80.4" dur="3.96">books it was before internet so I</text><text start="82.53" dur="3.75">couldn&apos;t Wikipedia things but we</text><text start="84.36" dur="5.31">certainly use books and encyclopedias</text><text start="86.28" dur="6.0">and and fortunately what was their logic</text><text start="89.67" dur="3.39">did they not like school they didn&apos;t</text><text start="92.28" dur="4.14">think it was going to be a good</text><text start="93.06" dur="5.73">education what was the reasoning yeah</text><text start="96.42" dur="5.43">they they were kind of educational</text><text start="98.79" dur="4.829">philosophers intuitively and had the</text><text start="101.85" dur="3.87">sense that kids ask lots of questions</text><text start="103.619" dur="3.841">they have a deep curiosity in school</text><text start="105.72" dur="4.71">mostly doesn&apos;t facilitate their</text><text start="107.46" dur="5.4">questions and so when the kid asks why</text><text start="110.43" dur="4.439">is the sky blue and why is fire hot and</text><text start="112.86" dur="4.02">what our emotions and whatever questions</text><text start="114.869" dur="3.511">they ask they&apos;re actually very deep</text><text start="116.88" dur="2.669">questions that if you want to address</text><text start="118.38" dur="3.599">why is the sky blue</text><text start="119.549" dur="3.631">there&apos;s atmospheric science there&apos;s</text><text start="121.979" dur="3.061">understanding the wavelengths of light</text><text start="123.18" dur="3.42">there&apos;s understanding the nature of our</text><text start="125.04" dur="3.809">solar system and astronomy and what a</text><text start="126.6" dur="4.23">Sun is and then there&apos;s the neuroscience</text><text start="128.849" dur="3.601">and optics and eyes and there&apos;s like a</text><text start="130.83" dur="2.58">lot that goes into it that naturally</text><text start="132.45" dur="2.58">starts to unfold</text><text start="133.41" dur="3.48">that helps people understand a lot of</text><text start="135.03" dur="3.99">topics and also an interconnected rather</text><text start="136.89" dur="4.8">than fragmented way if you follow the</text><text start="139.02" dur="3.96">curiosity but most parents and also most</text><text start="141.69" dur="5.04">teachers don&apos;t know how to answer those</text><text start="142.98" dur="5.49">things and so then I was gonna ask how</text><text start="146.73" dur="3.3">did your parents answer that like if my</text><text start="148.47" dur="3.18">kids ask me and now that I have kids</text><text start="150.03" dur="3.06">keep mind but if my kids were to ask me</text><text start="151.65" dur="3.15">a question that I didn&apos;t know the answer</text><text start="153.09" dur="3.45">to I&apos;d be like yeah let&apos;s get you to</text><text start="154.8" dur="2.61">public school real fast because I don&apos;t</text><text start="156.54" dur="4.32">want to keep answering these questions</text><text start="157.41" dur="6.03">so did one of your parents stay home</text><text start="160.86" dur="3.99">yeah both of them worked to work from</text><text start="163.44" dur="5.58">home as much as they could be pretty</text><text start="164.85" dur="6.18">available and if they didn&apos;t know the</text><text start="169.02" dur="4.8">answer then it was let&apos;s go see how to</text><text start="171.03" dur="4.68">figure that out and so that would be you</text><text start="173.82" dur="4.83">know going to the library and pulling</text><text start="175.71" dur="5.43">out cards to find the right book pulling</text><text start="178.65" dur="5.19">up encyclopedias also something even</text><text start="181.14" dur="4.05">better was them asking me why do you</text><text start="183.84" dur="3.78">think it might be how do you think it</text><text start="185.19" dur="4.83">might be so my answer was not instantly</text><text start="187.62" dur="4.77">just defer to outside authority was to</text><text start="190.02" dur="4.44">take the interest and facilitate my own</text><text start="192.39" dur="3.27">thinking on it but then to not just stay</text><text start="194.46" dur="3.39">there because the answer I come up with</text><text start="195.66" dur="4.89">might be totally gibberish but to</text><text start="197.85" dur="4.77">investigate so it was facilitating</text><text start="200.55" dur="4.47">interest and facilitating the process of</text><text start="202.62" dur="3.9">learning how to deepen the knowledge and</text><text start="205.02" dur="3.12">deepen the interest as it goes and of</text><text start="206.52" dur="3.57">course as you learn some things you</text><text start="208.14" dur="3.21">become aware of how much other adjacent</text><text start="210.09" dur="4.71">stuff that&apos;s interesting you don&apos;t know</text><text start="211.35" dur="5.22">is and so if you do that and you don&apos;t</text><text start="214.8" dur="3.659">force the kid to focus on and memorize</text><text start="216.57" dur="3.51">stuff with fear of punishment that they</text><text start="218.459" dur="2.881">have no interest in then you don&apos;t break</text><text start="220.08" dur="3.0">their interest in life and you actually</text><text start="221.34" dur="3.09">facilitate deepened interest and people</text><text start="223.08" dur="3.57">tend to become good at things they</text><text start="224.43" dur="4.62">really care about that yeah that is a</text><text start="226.65" dur="5.37">powerful thing when I think about part</text><text start="229.05" dur="4.98">of getting good is building desire and</text><text start="232.02" dur="4.62">if you can capitalize on something that</text><text start="234.03" dur="4.14">you&apos;re already on fire for and I&apos;ve</text><text start="236.64" dur="4.17">heard you talk about this in the</text><text start="238.17" dur="4.86">perspective of how you create that next</text><text start="240.81" dur="3.27">civilization you likened it to an iPhone</text><text start="243.03" dur="3.54">it&apos;s like you don&apos;t have to convince</text><text start="244.08" dur="4.35">people to get excited about technology</text><text start="246.57" dur="3.81">like it works and it brings some benefit</text><text start="248.43" dur="4.529">to your life and so people just adopt</text><text start="250.38" dur="4.35">things that they&apos;re really into I&apos;m</text><text start="252.959" dur="4.081">super curious oh you I think you have a</text><text start="254.73" dur="3.509">brother right or by coincidence there is</text><text start="257.04" dur="2.52">a guy on the board of one of your</text><text start="258.239" dur="3.81">companies with the exact same last name</text><text start="259.56" dur="6.51">is it just the two of you or they&apos;re</text><text start="262.049" dur="5.391">more so what&apos;s the age difference three</text><text start="266.07" dur="3.93">years younger</text><text start="267.44" dur="5.05">so how did your parents handle that was</text><text start="270.0" dur="4.29">he just sort of forced to come up to</text><text start="272.49" dur="3.27">your level did they split it up and</text><text start="274.29" dur="4.86">talking to one of you at one time and</text><text start="275.76" dur="7.83">the other another like I said they had</text><text start="279.15" dur="6.33">kind of intuitions about things that</text><text start="283.59" dur="3.81">were wrong with society that related to</text><text start="285.48" dur="3.81">how we developed humans and that kind of</text><text start="287.4" dur="3.81">was a sense of how to do education</text><text start="289.29" dur="3.2">differently how to do parenting happy</text><text start="291.21" dur="3.42">family differently but it was very</text><text start="292.49" dur="4.21">experimental they actually called our</text><text start="294.63" dur="4.89">family guinea pig for their four of us</text><text start="296.7" dur="5.28">and was an experiment and it didn&apos;t have</text><text start="299.52" dur="4.74">the benefit of studying Montessori and</text><text start="301.98" dur="3.48">Waldorf and lots of other systems that</text><text start="304.26" dur="3.54">had figured some things out so there</text><text start="305.46" dur="4.05">were a lot of mistakes that could have</text><text start="307.8" dur="3.72">been prevented but they were also the</text><text start="309.51" dur="5.94">benefit of they were in their own kind</text><text start="311.52" dur="6.06">of authentic inquiry and interest it</text><text start="315.45" dur="3.93">happened that my learning style innately</text><text start="317.58" dur="4.74">worked with what my parents knew how to</text><text start="319.38" dur="4.53">do better than my brothers did and so he</text><text start="322.32" dur="3.96">had a bit of a rougher go because I</text><text start="323.91" dur="4.259">think they expected his path of being</text><text start="326.28" dur="3.51">more similar to mine and it took a</text><text start="328.169" dur="3.301">little while for them to figure out that</text><text start="329.79" dur="2.7">he had a very different set of interests</text><text start="331.47" dur="3.87">and learning style</text><text start="332.49" dur="4.44">he ended up excelling at entrepreneurial</text><text start="335.34" dur="4.139">ISM and political activism and things</text><text start="336.93" dur="4.82">that were not my areas of focus once you</text><text start="339.479" dur="4.591">kind of figure that out do you have kids</text><text start="341.75" dur="4.36">and don&apos;t so that would have been</text><text start="344.07" dur="4.56">interesting to see like how you handle</text><text start="346.11" dur="4.29">that have you given a thought to how the</text><text start="348.63" dur="3.75">way that you came up and the fact that</text><text start="350.4" dur="4.2">it wasn&apos;t crushed out of you</text><text start="352.38" dur="4.56">could be systematized it could be</text><text start="354.6" dur="5.46">something that could be rolled out about</text><text start="356.94" dur="4.86">that of course so what is that in terms</text><text start="360.06" dur="4.62">of the ideal school system what does</text><text start="361.8" dur="4.56">that look like I think it&apos;s less to</text><text start="364.68" dur="3.42">think about it as an ideal school system</text><text start="366.36" dur="3.96">and as a civilization because by the</text><text start="368.1" dur="4.46">time the kid goes to school they&apos;ve</text><text start="370.32" dur="5.13">already been profoundly imprinted right</text><text start="372.56" dur="4.69">by the time they&apos;re 5 or 6 years old and</text><text start="375.45" dur="2.88">they&apos;re going to 1st grade or</text><text start="377.25" dur="3.57">kindergarten or wherever it is they</text><text start="378.33" dur="4.38">start they&apos;ve already fully learned the</text><text start="380.82" dur="3.9">language in which they think and all of</text><text start="382.71" dur="3.87">the ways that that language predisposes</text><text start="384.72" dur="7.08">patterns of thought they&apos;ve already</text><text start="386.58" dur="7.71">learned that the beginning of emotional</text><text start="391.8" dur="6.29">dispositions and social values and lots</text><text start="394.29" dur="6.09">of things and then obviously if the</text><text start="398.09" dur="2.71">educational system has to prepare kids</text><text start="400.38" dur="3.45">for the</text><text start="400.8" dur="4.92">workforce so we think about economics as</text><text start="403.83" dur="3.51">it is then it has to do certain things</text><text start="405.72" dur="3.12">that are not necessarily what would make</text><text start="407.34" dur="3.9">them the healthiest happiest people if</text><text start="408.84" dur="3.69">it&apos;s preparing them for a workforce as</text><text start="411.24" dur="4.679">the workforce changes through</text><text start="412.53" dur="7.259">technological automation and peak</text><text start="415.919" dur="5.191">resource issues of the planet and AI</text><text start="419.789" dur="4.921">automation and other things like that</text><text start="421.11" dur="6.75">obviously the role of education gets</text><text start="424.71" dur="4.919">completely recontextualized so instead</text><text start="427.86" dur="4.5">if you were to ask how would we redesign</text><text start="429.629" dur="5.371">civilization from scratch that included</text><text start="432.36" dur="5.82">the thing we call education but also we</text><text start="435.0" dur="4.919">mostly evolved in small bands and</text><text start="438.18" dur="3.03">villages where we didn&apos;t just have two</text><text start="439.919" dur="3.3">parents that were influencing us we had</text><text start="441.21" dur="3.989">a whole crew of people that we had</text><text start="443.219" dur="4.891">pretty deep connections with sub Dunbar</text><text start="445.199" dur="7.291">kind of connections is even the nuclear</text><text start="448.11" dur="6.299">family within a very large city</text><text start="452.49" dur="3.329">metropolis where you don&apos;t know hardly</text><text start="454.409" dur="3.81">anyone else but have interactions with</text><text start="455.819" dur="4.801">lots of people and then the mostly have</text><text start="458.219" dur="4.44">huge numbers of superficial interactions</text><text start="460.62" dur="3.96">via online social media platforms like</text><text start="462.659" dur="4.111">is that how what does that do to develop</text><text start="464.58" dur="4.889">humans so this question of ontological</text><text start="466.77" dur="5.04">design we build environments whether</text><text start="469.469" dur="3.871">it&apos;s schools or economic systems in the</text><text start="471.81" dur="6.69">nature of the incentive of economics</text><text start="473.34" dur="6.84">right as long as my ability to as long</text><text start="478.5" dur="3.539">as the forest I go and enjoy the forest</text><text start="480.18" dur="3.299">gives me no economic advantage but if I</text><text start="482.039" dur="3.271">cut it down and commoditize it it gives</text><text start="483.479" dur="3.72">me a lot of economic advantage the</text><text start="485.31" dur="3.18">economic system itself the perverse</text><text start="487.199" dur="2.97">incentive in the economic system is</text><text start="488.49" dur="4.019">conditioning value systems and people</text><text start="490.169" dur="3.81">and whoever does better at getting the</text><text start="492.509" dur="3.15">value systems that go along with the</text><text start="493.979" dur="3.9">economic incentive system will end up</text><text start="495.659" dur="3.81">getting more power within the system and</text><text start="497.879" dur="3.181">thus continuing to evolve the system in</text><text start="499.469" dur="3.181">the direction that benefits them and the</text><text start="501.06" dur="3.87">other people do well with it so if you</text><text start="502.65" dur="5.09">think about let me ask you so that I can</text><text start="504.93" dur="5.099">make sense of the world view so</text><text start="507.74" dur="5.44">everything that gets designed has a goal</text><text start="510.029" dur="4.89">in mind so when you first started</text><text start="513.18" dur="4.589">talking I thought that your punchline is</text><text start="514.919" dur="5.971">going to be sort of happiness health of</text><text start="517.769" dur="5.07">the individual is that accurate or is it</text><text start="520.89" dur="5.42">more the perpetuation of the species is</text><text start="522.839" dur="7.131">your if you had to say a highest value</text><text start="526.31" dur="8.26">would it be that a happy and healthy</text><text start="529.97" dur="7.869">populace that you know like imagine the</text><text start="534.57" dur="5.699">the movie was a children of men where</text><text start="537.839" dur="3.93">there are no more kids and so population</text><text start="540.269" dur="2.671">is basically the world&apos;s just ending</text><text start="541.769" dur="3.18">because they&apos;re not able to procreate</text><text start="542.94" dur="3.509">anymore but imagine that but it was like</text><text start="544.949" dur="3.091">everybody was having a great time right</text><text start="546.449" dur="3.781">until the moment they died or a</text><text start="548.04" dur="5.58">civilization where people are not</text><text start="550.23" dur="5.31">exactly loving life but we find a way to</text><text start="553.62" dur="3.719">get in balance with resources and we&apos;re</text><text start="555.54" dur="6.18">able to go on and on and on which of</text><text start="557.339" dur="6.271">those to you is better I think you set</text><text start="561.72" dur="5.489">it up to make it obvious that those are</text><text start="563.61" dur="7.099">both gibberish desires that a</text><text start="567.209" dur="6.271">civilization that is in an enduring hell</text><text start="570.709" dur="4.661">like well I won&apos;t go that far I&apos;m really</text><text start="573.48" dur="3.9">trying to find the perfect way to ask a</text><text start="575.37" dur="3.839">question where I can find out if it&apos;s</text><text start="577.38" dur="4.74">more meaningful to you to find a way to</text><text start="579.209" dur="6.36">continue on and so because I&apos;m looking</text><text start="582.12" dur="5.67">for what to optimize for and you can</text><text start="585.569" dur="4.801">optimize for continuation you can</text><text start="587.79" dur="4.14">optimize for happiness you obviously I</text><text start="590.37" dur="4.17">would assume want to do both but I&apos;m</text><text start="591.93" dur="5.099">trying to I find it it is very edifying</text><text start="594.54" dur="4.349">when you force people to force rank</text><text start="597.029" dur="5.49">things so that you can&apos;t have sort of</text><text start="598.889" dur="5.161">two number ones because I I now have</text><text

dur="4.5">here yeah if we do the thing you call</text><text start="629.94" dur="3.959">stack ranking which is an idea that</text><text start="631.589" dur="4.11">comes from computer science if I

themselves</text><text start="654.209" dur="6.06">we got somebody did the lithography to</text><text start="657.81" dur="4.199">make the computer chips and there&apos;s a</text><text start="660.269" dur="3.781">blueprint for the hardware and a</text><text start="662.009" dur="3.781">blueprint for the software in a</text><text start="664.05" dur="3.33">complicated system you&apos;ll notice like</text><text start="665.79" dur="2.06">this computer and the software doesn&apos;t</text><text start="667.38" dur="2.389">repair it</text><text start="667.85" dur="4.38">so if it gets harmed it doesn&apos;t self</text><text start="669.769" dur="4.26">evolved and the phase space of all the</text><text start="672.23" dur="4.349">things that can do are fully explicated</text><text start="674.029" dur="4.261">and it has formal causation if I hit</text><text start="676.579" dur="3.93">this key this will happen necessary and</text><text start="678.29" dur="5.789">sufficient causation in complex systems</text><text start="680.509" dur="5.19">like biology there isn&apos;t a blueprint the</text><text start="684.079" dur="3.63">genome isn&apos;t blueprints it&apos;s a generator</text><text start="685.699" dur="3.721">function to code new proteins under new</text><text start="687.709" dur="2.94">environments where you can have it do</text><text start="689.42"

generator</text><text start="694.819" dur="6.121">function and a blueprint aren&apos;t the same</text><text start="696.259" dur="7.2">thing the in a in a complex system also</text><text start="700.94" dur="4.47">it does self heal and self repair it</text><text start="703.459" dur="5.041">does also self evolve it&apos;s a it&apos;s</text><text start="705.41" dur="5.159">different in type so optimization Theory</text><text start="708.5" dur="3.75">from complicated systems the metaphor</text><text start="710.569" dur="3.45">where we thought our mind was a clock</text><text start="712.25" dur="2.94">when we figured out clocks before that</text><text start="714.019" dur="3.271">Native Americans might have thought of</text><text start="715.19" dur="3.629">the mind as an ecosystem right but then</text><text start="717.29" dur="3.45">we got a clock now known the mind is a</text><text start="718.819" dur="3.181">computer so we pick whatever the</text><text start="720.74" dur="2.55">metaphor that we&apos;re operating with this</text><text start="722.0" dur="4.079">but where the metaphor is wrong it</text><text start="723.29" dur="4.529">really [ __ ] stuff up and so it can give</text><text start="726.079" dur="3.421">you some very partial insights and also</text><text start="727.819" dur="4.291">some really dreadful differences so the</text><text start="729.5" dur="5.04">definition of a complex system is that</text><text start="732.11" dur="5.669">it has some emergent properties beyond</text><text start="734.54" dur="5.94">what any complicated model of it assumes</text><text start="737.779" dur="4.951">that the complicated model doesn&apos;t show</text><text start="740.48" dur="3.69">so basically if I take a cell and I try</text><text start="742.73" dur="3.33">to model it right so I try to make a</text><text start="744.17" dur="4.08">software program for how that cell works</text><text start="746.06" dur="3.57">the cell will do some things that that</text><text start="748.25" dur="2.819">model doesn&apos;t do and as I keep making</text><text start="749.63" dur="3.329">the model better it&apos;ll keep doing some</text><text start="751.069" dur="3.57">things that the model doesn&apos;t do that&apos;s</text><text start="752.959" dur="4.5">what we call an emergent property right</text><text start="754.639" dur="6.661">so what that means is if I make a model</text><text start="757.459" dur="5.73">because the my model of reality isn&apos;t</text><text start="761.3" dur="2.459">reality that&apos;s the first verse of the</text><text start="763.189" dur="2.7">daodejing</text><text start="763.759" dur="5.52">right the DAO that is speakable is not</text><text start="765.889" dur="5.341">the eternal doubt my model of the thing</text><text start="769.279" dur="3.18">isn&apos;t the actual thing so if I think the</text><text start="771.23" dur="3.69">model is the thing and then I try to</text><text start="772.459" dur="4.171">optimize for the model where the model</text><text start="774.92" dur="4.74">and the thing are different I actually</text><text start="776.63" dur="5.72">destroy the real thing can you put that</text><text start="779.66" dur="4.71">into real-world example I make a</text><text start="782.35" dur="4.169">economic calculus I make an economic</text><text start="784.37" dur="5.19">system for humans or these rational</text><text start="786.519" dur="6.67">self-serving agents and they follow</text><text start="789.56" dur="5.969">specific supply and demand economic</text><text start="793.189" dur="3.991">models and laws I can get more advanced</text><text start="795.529" dur="2.43">things to be able to look at the laws of</text><text start="797.18" dur="2.519">how they&apos;ll do with things like</text><text start="797.959" dur="3.191">derivative at blacks goals whatever but</text><text start="799.699" dur="3.371">they&apos;re basically simple mathematical</text><text start="801.15" dur="4.74">laws and say here&apos;s how we optimize</text><text start="803.07" dur="4.5">maximum productivity and generativity</text><text start="805.89" dur="3.03">for everyone and they don&apos;t work right</text><text start="807.57" dur="3.3">like they kind of work and then they</text><text start="808.92" dur="4.44">also lead to environmental destruction</text><text start="810.87" dur="5.46">which wasn&apos;t part of the metric set so</text><text start="813.36" dur="4.53">that this is where I&apos;m why I&apos;m trying to</text><text start="816.33" dur="3.0">get you to stack rank things which is</text><text start="817.89" dur="2.94">interesting that for you that&apos;s where it</text><text start="819.33" dur="3.66">breaks down for me to understand what</text><text start="820.83" dur="3.15">you mean when you say it doesn&apos;t work I</text><text start="822.99" dur="3.9">have to understand what you&apos;re trying to</text><text start="823.98" dur="5.34">optimize for so once I understand</text><text start="826.89" dur="5.25">because I in the beginning when I first</text><text start="829.32" dur="5.19">started diving into you I thought okay</text><text start="832.14" dur="5.16">this is about optimizing for what all</text><text start="834.51" dur="4.86">sort of round to human well-being but I</text><text start="837.3" dur="5.82">think there&apos;s an important caveat in</text><text start="839.37" dur="6.75">there which to you it is sort of beyond</text><text start="843.12" dur="4.5">critical and and I think the whole</text><text start="846.12" dur="4.49">meaning and purpose for you is that as</text><text start="847.62" dur="6.09">long as it is not a hell that</text><text start="850.61" dur="5.17">continuation is is a critical thing that</text><text start="853.71" dur="4.17">you that is sort of behind every word</text><text start="855.78" dur="3.06">that you say but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m</text><text start="857.88" dur="2.97">interpreting that right</text><text start="858.84" dur="4.44">okay so let&apos;s say that we&apos;re maximizing</text><text start="860.85" dur="4.82">for subjective happiness decoupled from</text><text start="863.28" dur="5.01">objective measures and so we&apos;re going to</text><text start="865.67" dur="4.87">find some types of states that we can</text><text start="868.29" dur="3.84">subjectively report on it well then the</text><text start="870.54" dur="3.63">matrix might actually be the best way to</text><text start="872.13" dur="3.9">optimize for it right</text><text start="874.17" dur="3.63">disconnect from any kind of object of</text><text start="876.03" dur="4.29">reality outside of brain stimulus and</text><text start="877.8" dur="4.92">just brains to make the [ __ ] out of the</text><text start="880.32" dur="5.82">dopamine urge ik response and say great</text><text start="882.72" dur="5.1">we optimized for human happiness and I</text><text start="886.14" dur="4.38">don&apos;t think anyone actually thinks</text><text start="887.82" dur="5.1">that&apos;s a maximally meaningful world or</text><text start="890.52" dur="4.32">if we say maximize for the happiness at</text><text start="892.92" dur="3.69">the individual level well some</text><text start="894.84" dur="3.18">individuals might be sadists and really</text><text start="896.61" dur="4.47">get off on hurting lots of other things</text><text start="898.02" dur="5.19">if we say maximize for continuance a</text><text start="901.08" dur="4.83">continuance that is really shitty it&apos;s</text><text start="903.21" dur="4.32">like why what is meaningful about life</text><text start="905.91" dur="3.06">that you would want to have continued so</text><text start="907.53" dur="3.21">what you&apos;re what I hear that you&apos;re</text><text start="908.97" dur="5.22">trying to ask is what is fundamentally</text><text start="910.74" dur="6.48">meaningful what is if we cannot I won&apos;t</text><text start="914.19" dur="7.35">use the word optimize but if we can act</text><text start="917.22" dur="6.06">in ways that benefit different things we</text><text start="921.54" dur="3.06">can say optimize but what you can end up</text><text start="923.28" dur="3.6">saying is that it&apos;s not optimizing a</text><text start="924.6" dur="5.94">single metric let me let me actually</text><text start="926.88" dur="5.25">make that clear let&apos;s say that I value</text><text start="930.54" dur="3.83">the life of rhinos and I don&apos;t want them</text><text start="932.13" dur="4.459">to go extinct and then</text><text start="934.37" dur="3.33">also value the life of coral and they</text><text start="936.589" dur="2.701">don&apos;t want it to go extinct but I also</text><text start="937.7" dur="3.74">value kids that I don&apos;t want to starve</text><text start="939.29" dur="6.989">in the third world and I also value</text><text start="941.44" dur="8.47">subjective happiness of poets now how</text><text start="946.279" dur="5.821">many dead rhinos are worth how much dead</text><text start="949.91" dur="4.59">coral are worth how many dead kids are</text><text start="952.1" dur="4.85">worth how much lack of happiness are</text><text start="954.5" dur="4.68">worth how many tons of co2 how do i</text><text start="956.95" dur="3.37">commensurate those metrics to then be</text><text start="959.18" dur="3.26">able to say what my optimization</text><text start="960.32" dur="5.07">algorithm is going to optimize for I</text><text start="962.44" dur="5.05">have to do some kind of waiting and then</text><text start="965.39" dur="3.75">I say well but in the context where the</text><text start="967.49" dur="3.0">Rhinos get below a certain number</text><text start="969.14" dur="2.76">they&apos;re worth more but then when they</text><text start="970.49" dur="2.94">get above a certain number they get oh</text><text start="971.9" dur="3.24">but then I didn&apos;t even account for all</text><text start="973.43" dur="3.21">the things these soil microbes without</text><text start="975.14" dur="2.52">which everything dies and I didn&apos;t even</text><text start="976.64" dur="2.49">account for them and this isn&apos;t now I</text><text start="977.66" dur="3.32">gotta bring soil microbes into it and</text><text start="979.13" dur="3.72">then I didn&apos;t account for the fact that</text><text start="980.98" dur="3.88">subjective reporting will have these</text><text start="982.85" dur="3.989">biases or miss these things or orient</text><text start="984.86" dur="3.69">towards addiction so whatever my</text><text start="986.839" dur="3.331">optimization said is there will be</text><text start="988.55" dur="3.479">things that are matter that are outside</text><text start="990.17" dur="5.359">of it that I have to continuously bring</text><text start="992.029" dur="6.151">in so the optimization is for the</text><text start="995.529" dur="5.591">evolutionary integrity of the whole or</text><text start="998.18" dur="6.17">wholeness itself which is different than</text><text start="1001.12" dur="6.089">how we think of theory of optimization</text><text start="1004.35" dur="5.7">so do we care about people&apos;s subjective</text><text start="1007.209" dur="4.741">experience yes you also care about</text><text start="1010.05" dur="3.64">objective metrics of the quality of</text><text start="1011.95" dur="3.15">their life like longevity and physical</text><text start="1013.69" dur="3.81">health and things like that yes also</text><text start="1015.1" dur="4.109">care about that do they correlate</text><text start="1017.5" dur="3.0">one-for-one no there are some very happy</text><text start="1019.209" dur="2.941">people who are crippled then there are</text><text start="1020.5" dur="3.24">some very physically able people who are</text><text start="1022.15" dur="3.23">miserable there are some people who are</text><text start="1023.74" dur="6.089">happy who make other people miserable</text><text start="1025.38" dur="6.16">and so and do we care about just</text><text start="1029.829" dur="3.12">individual quality of life or also the</text><text start="1031.54" dur="3.06">relationships what about happiness</text><text start="1032.949" dur="3.36">versus evolutionary rate what if we</text><text start="1034.6" dur="4.02">could be happy but stagnate versus</text><text start="1036.309" dur="5.461">evolve quite quickly but never enjoy the</text><text start="1038.62" dur="4.8">things we were evolving to and we all</text><text start="1041.77" dur="3.539">have this in our own life right like if</text><text start="1043.42" dur="3.57">do I want to be bettering myself but in</text><text start="1045.309" dur="2.88">a way where I&apos;m

to</text><text start="1049.69" dur="4.17">get better but I never actually enjoy</text><text start="1051.67" dur="3.57">any of it or do I accept myself in a way</text><text start="1053.86" dur="2.88">that makes me complacent well obviously</text><text start="1055.24" dur="3.54">it&apos;s neither of those I want to enjoy</text><text start="1056.74" dur="5.76">what it is fully and have my

dur="3.479">so I&apos;m optimizing for if anything the</text><text start="1066.13" dur="4.259">product of the dialect</text><text start="1068.049" dur="4.651">of my experience of life now and my</text><text start="1070.389" dur="3.081">ability to experience life more deeply</text><text start="1072.7" dur="4.319">into the future</text><text start="1073.47" dur="6.429">now if I take both

start="1105.669" dur="6.24">when I think about so you I don&apos;t know</text><text start="1110.23" dur="3.6">how much you think of yourself is being</text><text start="1111.909" dur="4.35">tied to

dur="6.059">interesting is okay Ken what one it do</text><text start="1126.7" dur="4.74">we believe it to be conceivable that we</text><text start="1128.529" dur="5.671">can actually construct

start="1136.419" dur="3.271">first I think people have to understand</text><text start="1138.22" dur="3.389">what it is and then we can go down the</text><text start="1139.69" dur="2.819">road of that

game</text><text start="1201.07" dur="4.979">a is a civilization that emerges</text><text start="1203.049" dur="5.36">dominated by game theory game which is</text><text start="1206.049" dur="4.921">basically what we&apos;re living in right and</text><text start="1208.409" dur="3.971">there was a recognition and I wasn&apos;t</text><text start="1210.97" dur="3.179">part of that crew I made friends with</text><text start="1212.38" dur="3.6">them after they actually disbanded that</text><text start="1214.149" dur="3.12">thing and then it kind of recycled and I</text><text start="1215.98" dur="6.329">was working on similar things in a</text><text start="1217.269" dur="6.961">different context so game B is the idea</text><text start="1222.309" dur="4.5">what would the game be what would the</text><text start="1224.23" dur="4.86">kind of game dynamics or how people show</text><text start="1226.809" dur="4.291">up in play of a game that doesn&apos;t orient</text><text start="1229.09" dur="3.99">toward self-determination so we&apos;d have</text><text start="1231.1" dur="3.9">to unpack a bit why we would say game a</text><text start="1233.08" dur="4.319">does intrinsically self-terminate what</text><text start="1235.0" dur="4.139">are the properties about it to say what</text><text start="1237.399" dur="5.581">would categorical solutions to those</text><text start="1239.139" dur="5.461">look like yeah so I don&apos;t know I&apos;ll</text><text start="1242.98" dur="3.659">answer the question at least as I</text><text start="1244.6" dur="3.419">understand it basically of a world with</text><text start="1246.639" dur="4.111">finite resources where you are</text><text start="1248.019" dur="5.51">incentivized so whaling is a great</text><text start="1250.75" dur="4.95">example I&apos;ve heard you use before if you</text><text start="1253.529" dur="3.911">capture that whale then you can sell it</text><text start="1255.7" dur="3.329">you can monetize it if you it has</text><text start="1257.44" dur="3.329">basically value to take it out of the</text><text start="1259.029" dur="3.931">ocean as zero value in the ocean and</text><text start="1260.769" dur="3.54">even if you were to say no no I want to</text><text start="1262.96" dur="2.669">live in the world where the whale stays</text><text start="1264.309" dur="2.7">in the ocean there&apos;s somebody else who</text><text start="1265.629" dur="3.451">goes how all right [ __ ] I&apos;m</text><text start="1267.009" dur="3.211">gonna go get the whale then so now it&apos;s</text><text start="1269.08" dur="2.28">like you&apos;re gonna lose the whale anyway</text><text start="1270.22" dur="2.939">so you might as well be the one that</text><text start="1271.36" dur="2.819">takes it and in a world of infinite</text><text start="1273.159" dur="2.311">resources you could actually get away</text><text start="1274.179" dur="3.901">with that but in the world of finite</text><text start="1275.47" dur="4.319">resources as you say it it ends itself</text><text start="1278.08" dur="5.189">eventually so you will run out of</text><text start="1279.789" dur="5.281">resources specifically because it&apos;s not</text><text start="1283.269" dur="4.29">that me seing the whale in the ocean</text><text start="1285.07" dur="5.729">doesn&apos;t provide any value to me that I</text><text start="1287.559" dur="5.7">call value I might feel a sense of all</text><text start="1290.799" dur="4.59">seeing it right I might feel a sense of</text><text start="1293.259" dur="4.65">interconnectedness or beauty or whatever</text><text start="1295.389" dur="4.201">it is but that doesn&apos;t increase my games</text><text start="1297.909" dur="3.75">here at a capacity to do anything I</text><text start="1299.59" dur="3.419">can&apos;t extract and exchange that value</text><text start="1301.659" dur="3.331">that experiencial value but if I kill</text><text start="1303.009" dur="3.481">the whale and I sell it as meat and I</text><text start="1304.99" dur="3.659">get that money that I can then go buy</text><text start="1306.49" dur="3.99">weapons or building materials or employ</text><text start="1308.649" dur="4.291">people with that actually increases my</text><text start="1310.48" dur="4.47">power so there are kinds of value that</text><text start="1312.94" dur="3.209">are extractable and exchangeable</text><text start="1314.95" dur="2.939">extractable accumulated will</text><text start="1316.149" dur="3.181">exchangeable that increased power and</text><text start="1317.889" dur="3.66">there are types of value that are</text><text start="1319.33" dur="4.439">appreciated but don&apos;t increase power so</text><text start="1321.549" dur="4.5">those who orient to the power increasing</text><text start="1323.769" dur="4.441">value end up getting more power and then</text><text start="1326.049" dur="4.11">dominating the system dynamics so then</text><text start="1328.21" dur="4.29">that creates a race to do that thing</text><text start="1330.159" dur="4.531">because like you said if I don&apos;t kill</text><text start="1332.5" dur="3.84">the whale I I&apos;m not</text><text start="1334.69" dur="3.3">protecting the whale because somebody</text><text start="1336.34" dur="3.48">else is gonna kill the whale now those</text><text start="1337.99" dur="3.51">guys might actually be my enemies and</text><text start="1339.82" dur="3.39">use that increased economic ability</text><text start="1341.5" dur="2.85">because they&apos;re gonna feed more people</text><text start="1343.21" dur="2.43">their population is going to grow and</text><text start="1344.35" dur="3.69">then they&apos;re gonna come kill us on war</text><text start="1345.64" dur="4.11">so actually for my own security not only</text><text start="1348.04" dur="3.6">do I have to now kill the whale I have</text><text start="1349.75" dur="4.05">to race to get them faster than that guy</text><text start="1351.64" dur="4.5">because now we&apos;re in a growth race which</text><text start="1353.8" dur="4.35">also means I&apos;m gonna advance whaling</text><text start="1356.14" dur="3.86">technologies to be able to take way more</text><text start="1358.15" dur="4.26">than I need grow my population base</text><text start="1360.0" dur="4.12">start exporting to other population</text><text start="1362.41" dur="3.33">bases so that I can get the optionality</text><text start="1364.12" dur="3.63">of money to build other kinds of things</text><text start="1365.74" dur="5.7">with and so what we end up giving is</text><text start="1367.75" dur="5.4">being able to see the industrialized</text><text start="1371.44" dur="4.35">fishing mechanisms that we have</text><text start="1373.15" dur="4.98">operating today that can fish more fish</text><text start="1375.79" dur="4.26">in a single net than maybe all of human</text><text start="1378.13" dur="3.33">history could in a year you know at</text><text start="1380.05" dur="6.8">previous points of human history and</text><text start="1381.46" dur="7.44">it&apos;s like the that kind of arms race</text><text start="1386.85" dur="3.67">multiplied by the ability to keep</text><text start="1388.9" dur="3.51">increasing the tech and when everybody</text><text start="1390.52" dur="4.62">increases the tech whether it&apos;s military</text><text start="1392.41"

have to try</text><text start="1399.85" dur="2.88">to get an advantage on you because you</text><text start="1401.47" dur="2.79">probably have some advantage you&apos;re</text><text start="1402.73" dur="3.27">trying to get the secret to have to spy</text><text start="1404.26" dur="3.51">on you I have to lie to your spies and</text><text start="1406.0" dur="4.17">hide the stuff and I have to try to keep</text><text start="1407.77" dur="3.96">advancing it but when you&apos;re advancing</text><text start="1410.17" dur="3.24">your weaponry and so in mind I&apos;m</text><text start="1411.73" dur="3.66">advancing relative to you you&apos;re</text><text start="1413.41" dur="3.63">advancing on the base of what exists you</text><text start="1415.39" dur="2.76">get a compounding curve which is an</text><text start="1417.04" dur="2.82">exponential curve and we&apos;ve only</text><text start="1418.15" dur="3.39">recently started to get to the vertical</text><text start="1419.86" dur="3.32">icing part of that curve started to go</text><text start="1421.54" dur="4.02">steep with the Industrial Revolution and</text><text start="1423.18" dur="3.88">then it started to go very steep with</text><text start="1425.56" dur="3.39">the information kind of revolution so</text><text start="1427.06" dur="3.51">we&apos;re just in a phase of what has really</text><text start="1428.95" dur="4.62">been a process that started since stone</text><text start="1430.57" dur="4.38">tools it was just a very slow curve and</text><text start="1433.57" dur="2.88">the stone tools thing for a long time</text><text start="1434.95" dur="4.14">and now it is in the quickly vertical</text><text start="1436.45" dur="5.4">izing so the thing is when you look in</text><text start="1439.09" dur="4.26">nature you see well animals compete they</text><text start="1441.85" dur="4.05">don&apos;t increase their competitive</text><text start="1443.35" dur="4.95">capacity rapidly or irrespective of each</text><text start="1445.9" dur="5.4">other right the tiger can&apos;t just become</text><text start="1448.3" dur="5.52">way better at hunting it has a pretty</text><text start="1451.3" dur="4.26">fixed killing capacity and it can only</text><text start="1453.82" dur="3.3">get better through natural selection</text><text start="1455.56" dur="3.54">which is a pretty slow process but the</text><text start="1457.12" dur="3.45">key is that it&apos;s a slow process that is</text><text start="1459.1" dur="3.84">evenly distributed across the whole</text><text start="1460.57" dur="4.14">forest because the things that lead to</text><text start="1462.94" dur="4.44">gene mutation and the tiger also leads</text><text start="1464.71" dur="4.469">to gene mutation in the deer</text><text start="1467.38" dur="3.36">the slightly faster tiger that eats the</text><text start="1469.179" dur="3.571">slightly slower deers makes the better</text><text start="1470.74" dur="3.54">jeans the faster jeans and the deers in</text><text start="1472.75" dur="3.33">breed together and so everything steps</text><text start="1474.28" dur="3.87">up together very slowly in the whole</text><text start="1476.08" dur="3.54">environment does what happened with</text><text start="1478.15" dur="3.96">stone tools as humans were able to</text><text start="1479.62" dur="4.169">increase our per day dove capacity way</text><text start="1482.11" dur="4.17">faster than the environment could</text><text start="1483.789" dur="4.111">increase its resilience to it and so we</text><text start="1486.28" dur="3.54">could start extinct ting species and</text><text start="1487.9" dur="4.2">devastating whole environments turning</text><text start="1489.82" dur="3.54">them to desert and moving on that was</text><text start="1492.1" dur="2.699">the beginning of something very</text><text start="1493.36" dur="2.79">different so when we think of social</text><text start="1494.799" dur="3.481">Darwinism where we try to model</text><text start="1496.15" dur="4.2">ourselves as apex predators we&apos;re just</text><text start="1498.28" dur="5.19">not [ __ ] apex predators apex predator</text><text start="1500.35" dur="5.1">theory doesn&apos;t apply because in Orca can</text><text start="1503.47" dur="4.02">kill a tuna at a time and

dur="5.189">since the Orca can&apos;t destroy it whole</text><text start="1512.38" dur="4.529">ecosystems and we can if we keep</text><text start="1515.169" dur="3.181">modeling ourselves with apex

I&apos;ve</text><text start="1535.84" dur="2.339">heard you say this before and I&apos;ve</text><text start="1537.07" dur="4.229">missed until just now</text><text start="1538.179" dur="5.041">is what&apos;s causing that ever escalation</text><text start="1541.299" dur="3.36">is because you&apos;re doing that in concert</text><text start="1543.22" dur="4.68">with people who are essentially your</text><text start="1544.659" dur="4.621">enemies so like with AI it it almost</text><text start="1547.9" dur="3.3">certainly will be a winner-take-all game</text><text start="1549.28" dur="4.23">because if somebody can beat you by a</text><text start="1551.2" dur="5.79">month and for a computer that&apos;s like a</text><text start="1553.51" dur="6.299">hundred years worth of learning you can</text><text start="1556.99" dur="4.53">see how just being the first is there</text><text start="1559.809" dur="4.561">gonna be the victor and so now you&apos;ve</text><text

tragedy of the</text><text start="1569.38" dur="5.429">Commons so this is part of the reason</text><text start="1572.59" dur="5.28">that I was trying to figure out sort of</text><text start="1574.809" dur="5.341">what you value most because for me</text><text start="1577.87" dur="3.809">everything comes down to if you want if</text><text start="1580.15" dur="3.029">you want to build a business I will</text><text start="1581.679" dur="3.511">speak in those terms which I understand</text><text start="1583.179" dur="2.851">very well you have to have a goal you</text><text start="1585.19" dur="3.239">have to know what you&apos;re trying to</text><text start="1586.03" dur="5.19">accomplish and the clear the goal the</text><text start="1588.429" dur="4.291">more likely you are to hit it and if you</text><text start="1591.22" dur="3.569">don&apos;t have a clear goal then you&apos;re just</text><text start="1592.72" dur="3.209">sort of steering by a vague sense of</text><text start="1594.789" dur="2.911">what you want to accomplish and it&apos;s</text><text start="1595.929" dur="3.12">going to become very difficult but there</text><text start="1597.7" dur="2.58">are what I call the physics of being</text><text start="1599.049" dur="2.911">human and the</text><text start="1600.28" dur="3.33">what I&apos;m obsessed with this humans are a</text><text start="1601.96"

dur="6.18">are like and so going to game B and</text><text start="1617.38" dur="3.81">thinking about constructing that and</text><text start="1619.12" dur="3.54">building something it&apos;s like when you</text><text start="1621.19" dur="5.07">were describing how interconnected</text><text start="1622.66" dur="5.19">everything is how complicated it is it</text><text start="1626.26" dur="3.84">really gives me pause about like</text><text start="1627.85" dur="4.59">thinking about Jesus man to really do</text><text start="1630.1" dur="3.9">something it is going to be it&apos;s going</text><text start="1632.44" dur="4.29">to be really [ __ ] difficult and when</text><text start="1634.0" dur="5.13">I when I go back through and look at the</text><text start="1636.73" dur="5.1">people that were a part of the game a</text><text start="1639.13" dur="4.89">game B conversation it&apos;s like I&apos;ll be</text><text start="1641.83" dur="3.9">very interested to see if ideas keep</text><text start="1644.02" dur="4.02">coming out and they&apos;re iterative and we</text><text start="1645.73" dur="4.65">find a way to actually migrate to an</text><text start="1648.04" dur="4.65">entirely new approach I mean it would be</text><text start="1650.38" dur="5.01">a new financial system it would be new</text><text start="1652.69" dur="6.69">architecture at every

start="1662.08" dur="6.33">that we&apos;re I want to say optimize but I</text><text start="1665.65" dur="5.22">know that that trips something that I</text><text start="1668.41" dur="4.44">don&apos;t

start="1675.49" dur="3.62">make this make more sense</text><text start="1679.89" dur="6.88">let&apos;s take Cove it and say when we&apos;re</text><text start="1684.7" dur="3.78">the CDC or the White

you</text><text start="3870.48" dur="6.45">realize that people&apos;s minds are the</text><text start="3873.87" dur="5.04">battlefield and also the treasure that</text><text start="3876.93" dur="5.94">is trying to be achieved and also the</text><text start="3878.91" dur="5.61">weapons right and so it&apos;s important to</text><text start="3882.87" dur="3.42">be like oh wait to what

start="3897.24" dur="3.75">now acting in the interest of somebody</text><text start="3899.37" dur="3.06">else I don&apos;t know why but that just</text><text start="3900.99" dur="4.59">really hit me as you were explaining</text><text start="3902.43" dur="5.82">that like are my ideas my own there was</text><text start="3905.58" dur="4.68">a band back in the 80s called queens</text><text start="3908.25" dur="4.28">Reich and they were the first people</text><text start="3910.26" dur="4.65">that really got me to think critically</text><text start="3912.53" dur="5.05">so I definitely owe them a debt of</text><text start="3914.91" dur="4.92">gratitude and they had this whole</text><text start="3917.58" dur="5.13">concept album around this guy that was</text><text start="3919.83" dur="4.98">controlling people&apos;s minds by basically</text><text start="3922.71" dur="4.23">getting them addicted and then helping</text><text start="3924.81" dur="3.42">them clean up but then like hey I did</text><text start="3926.94" dur="4.32">this for you so you&apos;re gonna do this for</text><text start="3928.23" dur="4.32">me it&apos;s really terrifying when you</text><text start="3931.26" dur="3.75">couple that with what you were saying</text><text start="3932.55" dur="5.4">about social media and how you&apos;ve been</text><text start="3935.01" dur="4.68">essentially groomed to push they&apos;ve</text><text start="3937.95" dur="3.39">pushed you in a direction that you</text><text start="3939.69" dur="2.79">started right depending on what you</text><text start="3941.34" dur="4.47">hovered over and what you clicked on</text><text start="3942.48" dur="6.66">like some you are very involved in this</text><text start="3945.81" dur="4.56">process but the them optimizing right</text><text start="3949.14" dur="3.93">second and third-order consequence is</text><text start="3950.37" dur="5.96">them optimizing for time on site the</text><text

think about the the</text><text start="3978.0" dur="4.32">thing about what&apos;s kicked off with the</text><text start="3979.77" dur="5.55">riots like protesting I love them all</text><text start="3982.32" dur="5.46">for it when it kicked off into like</text><text start="3985.32" dur="5.31">looking out my window and seeing things</text><text start="3987.78" dur="6.24">burning it was like that&apos;s where I go</text><text start="3990.63" dur="5.31">okay like you that [ __ ] that gets really</text><text start="3994.02" dur="3.6">scary really fast and when you get into</text><text start="3995.94" dur="2.88">the weeds of like the complicated who&apos;s</text><text start="3997.62" dur="3.42">actually breaking the windows who&apos;s</text><text start="3998.82" dur="6.299">actually setting the fires and</text><text start="4001.04" dur="7.289">the sort of swirl of very difficult to</text><text start="4005.119" dur="6.271">parse apart things presents itself to</text><text start="4008.329" dur="5.28">you that&apos;s where like understanding how</text><text start="4011.39" dur="4.29">to begin to extract the information how</text><text start="4013.609" dur="4.621">to learn about something that you don&apos;t</text><text start="4015.68" dur="5.34">know about there was a lot of pressure</text><text start="4018.23" dur="4.619">to speak out and I was like I&apos;m not</text><text start="4021.02" dur="4.62">saying [ __ ] until I understand what&apos;s</text><text start="4022.849" dur="4.23">actually going on and even just going</text><text start="4025.64" dur="3.15">into that and beginning to realize okay</text><text start="4027.079" dur="3.631">this is a big world this is complicated</text><text start="4028.79" dur="3.12">there&apos;s there isn&apos;t a party line like</text><text start="4030.71" dur="4.28">it&apos;s being presented there are a lot of</text><text start="4031.91" dur="4.77">different thinkers across sort of every</text><text start="4034.99" dur="3.07">statement that&apos;s being made there&apos;s</text><text start="4036.68" dur="5.58">somebody that disagrees with it quite</text><text start="4038.06" dur="6.57">vehemently so my strategy for that and</text><text start="4042.26" dur="5.04">I&apos;d be super curious to to hear what you</text><text start="4044.63" dur="3.87">think on this so I&apos;ve got what I what we</text><text start="4047.3" dur="3.15">talked about earlier the physics of</text><text start="4048.5" dur="3.9">being human so any any data point that I</text><text start="4050.45" dur="3.6">take in has to jive with what I know is</text><text start="4052.4" dur="5.0">true about humans and the way the humans</text><text start="4054.05" dur="6.36">act and think and process and when I see</text><text start="4057.4" dur="3.76">people just repeating mimetic statements</text><text start="4060.41" dur="2.97">over and over and over</text><text start="4061.16" dur="3.75">it&apos;s like odds are that&apos;s not an</text><text start="4063.38" dur="4.5">original thought for you because you&apos;re</text><text start="4064.91" dur="5.61">just repeating the same thing and then</text><text start="4067.88" dur="4.949">also looking at both sides of the</text><text start="4070.52" dur="5.61">argument so it&apos;s like I know how</text><text start="4072.829" dur="4.591">algorithms work because as a person with</text><text start="4076.13" dur="2.79">a youtube channel like you have to</text><text start="4077.42" dur="3.63">understand how it works to make sure</text><text start="4078.92" dur="4.08">that your stuff is getting presented to</text><text start="4081.05" dur="3.42">people so you learn real fast what the</text><text start="4083.0" dur="3.72">algorithm likes what it doesn&apos;t you</text><text start="4084.47" dur="3.869">learn what the algorithm is using as a</text><text start="4086.72" dur="2.79">barometer of whether this is something</text><text start="4088.339" dur="2.671">that should be pushed out more so you</text><text start="4089.51" dur="4.109">pay attention to that stuff so I&apos;m like</text><text start="4091.01" dur="3.78">I know if I watch this type of voice I&apos;m</text><text start="4093.619" dur="3.031">gonna get more of that type of voice so</text><text start="4094.79" dur="3.569">then you&apos;ve got to actively seek out the</text><text start="4096.65" dur="3.27">other side and there&apos;s been so many</text><text start="4098.359" dur="3.991">times I&apos;m like whoa like that&apos;s</text><text start="4099.92" dur="4.319">brilliant coming from you know side-a</text><text start="4102.35" dur="5.159">and then wow this is brilliant coming</text><text start="4104.239" dur="5.52">from side B and so it&apos;s like until I get</text><text start="4107.509" dur="3.931">a sense of like the edges right okay</text><text start="4109.759" dur="4.31">this is edge case over here this is edge</text><text

that the human mind works</text><text start="4118.19" dur="3.45">now I think I&apos;m beginning to understand</text><text start="4119.81" dur="4.38">this thing and I can begin to sort of</text><text start="4121.64" dur="4.349">try out my own ideas and that&apos;s what I</text><text start="4124.19" dur="3.6">do then the next thing so I&apos;ve taken in</text><text start="4125.989" dur="4.321">all

to articulate it I</text><text start="4146.03" dur="6.36">realize sort of where the edges you know</text><text start="4148.49" dur="5.43">of my ignorance are and that helps me</text><text

don&apos;t have a particularly useful</text><text start="4160.7" dur="5.1">way of going oh [ __ ] that was all false</text><text start="4163.37" dur="5.79">propaganda to begin with do you have a</text><text start="4165.8" dur="5.07">way of like are there certain outlets</text><text start="4169.16" dur="3.81">that you trust how do you build trust</text><text start="4170.87" dur="14.07">maybe that&apos;s the easiest way trust</text><text start="4172.97" dur="15.599">around information I would say that the</text><text start="4184.94" dur="5.28">idea that there are any authorities

dur="3.81">everything you were doing was right and</text><text start="4907.43" dur="5.17">one of the things are so fascinating was</text><text start="4909.78" dur="4.53">something like 90% of the Nazi

dur="3.48">selling our kids into slavery and like</text><text start="4926.09" dur="3.64">it seemed like they were doing it</text><text start="4928.05" dur="3.96">consciously and we were just standing up</text><text start="4929.73" dur="3.33">for ourselves and so originally I did</text><text start="4932.01" dur="1.91">but then we started to get into places</text><text start="4933.06" dur="3.47">that were really [ __ ]</text><text start="4933.92" dur="4.14">and so 90% of them said no I didn&apos;t</text><text start="4936.53" dur="3.51">think it was alright then they&apos;re

who were</text><text start="4948.199" dur="7.801">basically officers orders and if I if I</text><text start="4954.44" dur="3.36">went against this I&apos;d be putting the gas</text><text

and</text><text start="4965.3" dur="5.28">yet ninety percent of the people</text><text start="4966.5" dur="6.21">actually felt that way right so the same</text><text start="4970.58" dur="5.55">is true with the Inquisition&apos;s or the or</text><text start="4972.71" dur="6.18">the Crusades or the and it&apos;s even true</text><text start="4976.13" dur="6.87">today of if you grow up in a very</text><text start="4978.89" dur="6.42">religious area what is what happens if</text><text start="4983.0" dur="3.54">you give up on the religion right so we</text><text start="4985.31" dur="4.44">know what the punishment for apostasy</text><text start="4986.54" dur="4.949">and fundamentalist Islam is but if you</text><text start="4989.75" dur="4.08">grew up in Utah in the strict

you&apos;re</text><text start="5001.63" dur="6.21">going to lose heaven and all those kinds</text><text start="5003.85" dur="6.18">of things so people believe things less</text><text start="5007.84" dur="5.339">because they are true and more because</text><text start="5010.03" dur="4.919">they are useful than they realize useful</text><text start="5013.179" dur="6.511">and staying in the group staying in the</text><text start="5014.949" dur="6.841">good graces meeting some need mostly</text><text start="5019.69" dur="3.9">people believe things because it seems</text><text start="5021.79" dur="3.24">like it will meet some need for them or</text><text start="5023.59" dur="3.81">believing something else will damage</text><text start="5025.03" dur="4.74">that need and then they rationally</text><text start="5027.4" dur="3.99">backfill epistemology but they didn&apos;t do</text><text start="5029.77" dur="3.51">a pistol nology to come to the belief</text><text start="5031.39" dur="5.27">they emotionally came to the belief and</text><text start="5033.28" dur="5.22">then they backfill epistemology so</text><text start="5036.66" dur="4.0">rationalizing is the opposite of being</text><text start="5038.5" dur="6.989">rational being rational is not starting</text><text start="5040.66" dur="6.66">those well synced being rational is</text><text start="5045.489" dur="3.541">starting with I don&apos;t know let&apos;s go</text><text start="5047.32" dur="3.51">through the process let&apos;s try what are</text><text start="5049.03" dur="4.08">all the hypotheses what is the evidence</text><text start="5050.83" dur="4.02">for all the hypotheses rationalizing is</text><text start="5053.11" dur="3.92">I jump straight to belief and now I&apos;m</text><text start="5054.85" dur="5.16">going to try to create backfilled</text><text start="5057.03" dur="6.79">rationale for it and pretend that that&apos;s</text><text start="5060.01" dur="7.39">how I got there I&apos;ll give you actually a</text><text start="5063.82" dur="5.05">really interesting example one</text><text start="5067.4" dur="3.12">the things the political left and the US</text><text start="5068.87" dur="3.93">likes to do is make fun of the political</text><text start="5070.52" dur="3.81">right for being stupid you can see this</text><text start="5072.8" dur="4.65">with Bill Maher or other kinds of</text><text start="5074.33" dur="4.8">comedians and it&apos;s part of their</text><text start="5077.45" dur="4.83">narrative warfare strategy feeling</text><text start="5079.13" dur="7.44">superior through being more educated and</text><text start="5082.28" dur="6.72">whatever and and the political rate has</text><text start="5086.57" dur="4.74">it&apos;s methods of narrative warfare and so</text><text start="5089.0" dur="4.56">I&apos;m not commenting on the rightness or</text><text start="5091.31" dur="3.48">not of the underlying ideas but the the</text><text start="5093.56" dur="4.05">weaponry that&apos;s genius</text><text start="5094.79" dur="6.45">and nobody wants to feel really stupid</text><text start="5097.61" dur="5.25">and so you actually stay in group by</text><text start="5101.24" dur="3.21">laughing at the people who are on the</text><text start="5102.86" dur="3.45">out group as opposed to defending the</text><text start="5104.45" dur="3.18">people who are so obviously stupid that</text><text start="5106.31" dur="2.91">you&apos;re obviously stupid if you would</text><text start="5107.63" dur="5.88">even sympathize with them at all right</text><text start="5109.22" dur="7.26">so that&apos;s actually appealing to very not</text><text start="5113.51" dur="7.02">rational things in-group out-group</text><text start="5116.48" dur="7.02">desire not to seem stupid in the name of</text><text start="5120.53" dur="9.45">higher intellect so it&apos;s very tricky and</text><text start="5123.5" dur="8.07">sophisticated so there&apos;s a left comedian</text><text start="5129.98" dur="3.03">who went to some Trump rallies recently</text><text start="5131.57" dur="3.03">and interviewed Trump supporters and</text><text start="5133.01" dur="3.39">made a compilation of how utterly stupid</text><text start="5134.6" dur="3.57">Trump supporters are now of course he</text><text start="5136.4" dur="3.42">didn&apos;t include any of the places where</text><text start="5138.17" dur="3.45">there Trump supporters that are well</text><text start="5139.82" dur="3.45">educated and have good philosophy and</text><text start="5141.62" dur="4.05">there are other ones that will show</text><text start="5143.27" dur="4.11">right oriented people going to a bunch</text><text start="5145.67" dur="3.42">of left or and Tifa people and making</text><text start="5147.38" dur="4.08">them look like utter idiot so they&apos;ll</text><text start="5149.09" dur="3.54">both use that tactic right so of course</text><text start="5151.46" dur="2.49">the first thing we have to see is as</text><text start="5152.63" dur="2.82">we&apos;re laughing at the dumb Trump</text><text start="5153.95" dur="4.08">supporters in this thing it was cherry</text><text start="5155.45" dur="4.77">picked for that purpose of all of the</text><text start="5158.03" dur="3.57">people to then give the sense that that</text><text start="5160.22" dur="3.72">was ubiquitous that they&apos;re all that</text><text start="5161.6" dur="6.0">done right okay so you watch the thing</text><text start="5163.94" dur="6.66">and it&apos;s actually impressive how much</text><text start="5167.6" dur="4.1">these people have rejected there&apos;s</text><text start="5170.6" dur="2.73">actually pride around</text><text start="5171.7" dur="3.49">anti-intellectualism within this</text><text start="5173.33" dur="3.54">population there&apos;s a particular part of</text><text start="5175.19" dur="5.55">the right that has a anti intellectual</text><text start="5176.87" dur="6.59">pride and so they the guy is you know</text><text start="5180.74" dur="4.83">saying very basic things about</text><text start="5183.46" dur="4.84">government or how bill becomes a law or</text><text start="5185.57" dur="3.99">whatever intentionally like showing how</text><text start="5188.3" dur="2.55">stupid the people are that they don&apos;t</text><text start="5189.56" dur="3.09">know the basics of politics and they&apos;re</text><text start="5190.85" dur="3.66">certain of wrong things and whatever and</text><text start="5192.65" dur="3.96">then tries to take it further and says</text><text start="5194.51" dur="3.42">if if if Trump used the n-word would you</text><text start="5196.61" dur="3.84">vote for him yeah I&apos;d still vote for him</text><text start="5197.93" dur="2.76">if he whatever and they ran different</text><text start="5200.45" dur="1.86">thing</text><text start="5200.69" dur="3.029">and at one point it said something like</text><text start="5202.31" dur="2.67">if Trump said that everyone need to</text><text start="5203.719" dur="3.541">start [ __ ] pigs would you vote for</text><text start="5204.98" dur="4.949">him yea I&apos;d still vote for him and what</text><text start="5207.26" dur="3.87">it was trying to say isn&apos;t that guy who</text><text start="5209.929" dur="4.881">says yeah I&apos;d still vote for him is</text><text start="5211.13" dur="6.96">saying my mind is not open to new ideas</text><text start="5214.81" dur="5.02">like my mind has closed to new ideas I</text><text start="5218.09" dur="4.08">have already made my decision I&apos;m going</text><text start="5219.83" dur="5.88">with it so you have to say what made him</text><text start="5222.17" dur="8.85">get there well one of the things that&apos;s</text><text start="5225.71" dur="7.77">actually insightful is he intuited in</text><text start="5231.02" dur="3.84">someplace that he couldn&apos;t make sense of</text><text start="5233.48" dur="3.449">what was going on and when the pundits</text><text start="5234.86" dur="3.66">were talking it was above his head and</text><text start="5236.929" dur="5.071">that they were trying to use</text><text start="5238.52" dur="5.219">intellectualism and data and statistics</text><text start="5242.0" dur="3.0">and whatever to say things that felt</text><text start="5243.739" dur="2.971">like they were gonna [ __ ] his world up</text><text start="5245.0" dur="4.679">that weren&apos;t in his interest right that</text><text start="5246.71" dur="6.0">seemed against his interest and so he</text><text start="5249.679" dur="5.31">basically said I know my mind he&apos;s not</text><text start="5252.71" dur="5.4">this sophisticated but subconsciously I</text><text start="5254.989" dur="4.861">know my mind is a battleground of people</text><text start="5258.11" dur="4.14">more sophisticated than me who are gonna</text><text start="5259.85" dur="3.78">try to convince me what is true but I</text><text start="5262.25" dur="3.96">don&apos;t think they have my interest in</text><text start="5263.63" dur="4.35">mind so this Trump guy it doesn&apos;t matter</text><text start="5266.21" dur="3.69">if it&apos;s true or not I actually feel</text><text start="5267.98" dur="5.13">safer being on his side in a world that</text><text start="5269.9" dur="5.239">feels like it&apos;s in more he feels more</text><text start="5273.11" dur="6.48">like me and he feels like he might win</text><text start="5275.139" dur="7.841">and I don&apos;t want the susceptibility of</text><text start="5279.59" dur="4.83">people trying to confuse me to be</text><text start="5282.98" dur="3.989">possible so it&apos;s very interesting to see</text><text start="5284.42" dur="6.56">how the that anti intellectual thing was</text><text start="5286.969" dur="6.121">actually a compensating weapon of</text><text start="5290.98" dur="3.489">intellectual weapons being used to</text><text start="5293.09" dur="3.77">control people in ways that they could</text><text start="5294.469" dur="4.92">tell weren&apos;t fully in their interest</text><text start="5296.86" dur="6.549">that that&apos;s really interesting and this</text><text start="5299.389" dur="7.77">is where cognitive distribution to make</text><text start="5303.409" dur="5.73">it sound fancy the fact that sadly not</text><text start="5307.159" dur="4.951">all mines are created equal it&apos;s like</text><text start="5309.139" dur="4.621">man when you have like when I look at</text><text start="5312.11" dur="6.089">people that are clearly smarter than me</text><text start="5313.76" dur="8.07">I&apos;m just like dude this is deeply</text><text start="5318.199" dur="5.161">problematic to try to make sense of what</text><text start="5321.83" dur="5.309">they&apos;re saying and to engage with what</text><text start="5323.36" dur="5.73">they&apos;re saying it is I get it man I feel</text><text start="5327.139" dur="3.511">for people when it it you you can tell</text><text start="5329.09" dur="3.81">you&apos;re being moved around the board like</text><text start="5330.65" dur="3.449">a chess piece and you&apos;re not sure like</text><text start="5332.9" dur="2.91">where the trap is coming</text><text start="5334.099" dur="3.75">but you know that there is a trap coming</text><text start="5335.81" dur="4.76">and hold on one second because I have an</text><text start="5337.849" dur="2.721">alarm going off</text><text start="5351.34" dur="6.779">all right sorry about that I am normally</text><text start="5354.88" dur="5.759">I don&apos;t film this late so I didn&apos;t even</text><text start="5358.119" dur="4.411">think to check my bad</text><text start="5360.639" dur="4.591">so yeah when you&apos;ve got somebody that is</text><text start="5362.53" dur="3.81">just you know outperforming you and you</text><text start="5365.23" dur="3.29">can feel that you&apos;re being moved around</text><text start="5366.34" dur="5.37">that chess board it is so disconcerting</text><text start="5368.52" dur="6.61">that I can see how people would end up</text><text start="5371.71" dur="6.21">shutting down and so this is why we like</text><text start="5375.13" dur="4.98">debates as we think okay that

of the people who resonate</text><text start="5438.67" dur="3.509">with the type of arguments he likes his</text><text start="5440.59" dur="3.18">arguments resonate with him is true and</text><text

a felt sense dude let me tell</text><text start="5448.57" dur="4.29">you as somebody who does a lot of public</text><text start="5450.67" dur="5.25">speaking I will tell you right now that</text><text start="5452.86" dur="5.67">I can move an audience by changing not</text><text start="5455.92" dur="6.12">what I say but how I say it and I</text><text start="5458.53" dur="6.51">learned very early on that by putting</text><text start="5462.04" dur="6.75">time and energy into getting good at the</text><text start="5465.04" dur="6.72">performative layer of a talk mm made a</text><text start="5468.79" dur="4.44">huge difference and so when I was young</text><text start="5471.76" dur="2.669">I wanted to be a stand-up comic and so I</text><text start="5473.23" dur="2.52">spent a lot of time in front of</text><text start="5474.429" dur="2.821">audiences I spent a lot of time</text><text start="5475.75" dur="6.36">practicing like what I was doing with my</text><text start="5477.25" dur="7.62">face modulating my voice and it is it is</text><text start="5482.11" dur="4.2">a little it&apos;s exciting when you</text><text start="5484.87" dur="3.15">feel like you&apos;re doing things for the</text><text start="5486.31" dur="3.86">right reasons but it&apos;s a little</text><text start="5488.02" dur="6.78">unnerving when I think about like</text><text start="5490.17" dur="6.04">charisma goes a long way man just by the</text><text start="5494.8" dur="2.58">way that you make somebody feel they</text><text start="5496.21" dur="2.7">always say you don&apos;t remember what</text><text start="5497.38" dur="3.18">somebody did or what they said you</text><text start="5498.91" dur="3.3">remember how they made you feel and so</text><text start="5500.56" dur="3.06">if you can make somebody feel good if</text><text start="5502.21" dur="3.09">you can hype them up and I tell</text><text start="5503.62" dur="4.35">audiences all the time and this is sort</text><text start="5505.3" dur="4.23">of the core friction of my life is I</text><text start="5507.97" dur="4.68">have what I call a two-hour declining</text><text start="5509.53" dur="4.44">arc of influence so if you if you get me</text><text start="5512.65" dur="2.91">in a room with somebody my whole thing</text><text start="5513.97" dur="2.94">is get me in the room if you give me the</text><text start="5515.56" dur="4.26">room I will [ __ ] make somebody feel</text><text start="5516.91" dur="4.35">something I can be very persuasive when</text><text start="5519.82" dur="2.76">I really believe in something and I&apos;m</text><text start="5521.26" dur="3.78">really passionate because I can bring</text><text start="5522.58" dur="3.72">that out and I can energy infects other</text><text start="5525.04" dur="2.49">people and so you can infect them with</text><text start="5526.3" dur="3.87">your enthusiasm you can get them hyped</text><text start="5527.53" dur="5.16">up but as soon as I walk away it&apos;s like</text><text start="5530.17" dur="3.72">it that sense of like because I try to</text><text start="5532.69" dur="2.85">give people the sense that they can do</text><text start="5533.89" dur="2.91">it right whatever it is like you can do</text><text start="5535.54" dur="3.84">it you can make it come true and let me</text><text start="5536.8" dur="5.01">tell you and I know that when I walk</text><text start="5539.38" dur="5.37">away that feeling begins to wane and so</text><text start="5541.81" dur="5.37">it&apos;s like how do you get beyond just the</text><text start="5544.75" dur="4.29">the ability to whip people into an</text><text start="5547.18" dur="4.41">emotional frenzy and actually get them</text><text start="5549.04" dur="4.05">to think critically to form an opinion</text><text start="5551.59" dur="2.85">to say okay I actually think I</text><text start="5553.09" dur="3.66">understand how these pieces work</text><text start="5554.44" dur="3.87">together and then it&apos;s like you can</text><text start="5556.75" dur="3.89">begin to form your own opinion then you</text><text start="5558.31" dur="5.73">can you know how to move to a world but</text><text start="5560.64" dur="6.01">otherwise how to do that for your</text><text start="5564.04" dur="5.76">listeners right now how to please how</text><text start="5566.65" dur="5.37">because similar this conversation might</text><text start="5569.8" dur="4.86">have some impact on them for like a day</text><text start="5572.02" dur="3.84">maybe right but the moment they have</text><text start="5574.66" dur="3.51">scrolled their Facebook feed they&apos;ve</text><text start="5575.86" dur="7.08">forgotten about it and they&apos;re now fully</text><text start="5578.17" dur="6.48">inundated with other things and so how</text><text start="5582.94" dur="5.85">why would why do we bother doing this at</text><text start="5584.65" dur="5.52">all so if someone is feeling a</text><text start="5588.79" dur="2.76">particular kind of resonance and</text><text start="5590.17" dur="4.14">inspiration they have to take some</text><text start="5591.55" dur="6.18">actions it will keep it feeding or</text><text start="5594.31" dur="5.19">nurturing that and so let&apos;s talk about a</text><text start="5597.73" dur="3.93">few things people can do because when</text><text start="5599.5" dur="3.36">you&apos;re in the room with them whether</text><text start="5601.66" dur="3.18">it&apos;s just that you&apos;re giving them better</text><text start="5602.86" dur="3.57">information or you&apos;re emotionally</text><text start="5604.84" dur="5.4">influencing them they&apos;re influenced by</text><text start="5606.43" dur="4.98">what they&apos;re around and so if some but</text><text start="5610.24" dur="3.03">then when you leave they&apos;re influenced</text><text start="5611.41" dur="3.57">by whatever they&apos;re around next what</text><text start="5613.27" dur="2.29">you&apos;re trying to do is make them have</text><text start="5614.98" dur="2.8">more</text><text start="5615.56" dur="5.1">a internal locus of control to be more</text><text start="5617.78" dur="5.64">self influencing well the the kind of</text><text start="5620.66" dur="6.48">influence I would say illegitimate power</text><text start="5623.42" dur="5.85">in a game be sense illegitimate power is</text><text start="5627.14" dur="5.61">where I&apos;m trying to influence people</text><text start="5629.27" dur="5.52">towards my agenda perpetually legitimate</text><text start="5632.75" dur="6.39">power is where I&apos;m trying to influence</text><text start="5634.79" dur="6.42">them to be more self directing which is</text><text start="5639.14" dur="4.11">basically what a good parent or a</text><text start="5641.21" dur="3.51">teacher is trying to do is to increase</text><text start="5643.25" dur="3.24">someone&apos;s capacity to make their own</text><text start="5644.72" dur="5.58">good sense making their own good</text><text start="5646.49" dur="5.1">decisions and whereas to the degree that</text><text start="5650.3" dur="3.06">I&apos;m trying to convince them what to</text><text start="5651.59" dur="5.4">think that aligns with an agenda I have</text><text start="5653.36" dur="5.31">that is a you know game theoretic thing</text><text start="5656.99" dur="2.79">that will then produce counter responses</text><text start="5658.67" dur="7.59">of other people who want to convince</text><text start="5659.78" dur="10.4">some of some other thing but as people</text><text start="5666.26" dur="3.92">are seeking to become more</text><text start="5670.24" dur="5.29">self-determined the first thing is to</text><text start="5673.85" dur="3.9">recognize how much you are not self</text><text start="5675.53" dur="3.9">determined to recognize how much the</text><text start="5677.75" dur="2.82">information streams coming into your</text><text start="5679.43" dur="3.93">eyes and ears and who you around</text><text start="5680.57" dur="4.11">influences and start changing that one</text><text start="5683.36" dur="3.36">of the best acts of self-determination</text><text start="5684.68" dur="5.31">is to change the things other than you</text><text start="5686.72" dur="4.89">that are influencing you and so we</text><text start="5689.99" dur="4.83">talked about the problem of social media</text><text start="5691.61" dur="5.0">if you care about your own well-being</text><text start="5694.82" dur="3.87">enough you&apos;ll just quit social media</text><text start="5696.61" dur="3.4">your own well-being in your ability to</text><text start="5698.69" dur="4.83">understand the world and you&apos;ll start</text><text start="5700.01" dur="5.97">finding sources of news that are better</text><text start="5703.52" dur="4.35">than social media that aren&apos;t AI curated</text><text start="5705.98" dur="4.35">for limbic optimization for you but that</text><text start="5707.87" dur="4.77">you&apos;re curating based on what seems to</text><text start="5710.33" dur="4.41">be good information and you&apos;ll find left</text><text start="5712.64" dur="3.72">sources and right sources and sources</text><text start="5714.74" dur="4.29">from other countries and whatever to try</text><text start="5716.36" dur="4.26">to make sense of stuff if you are going</text><text start="5719.03" dur="2.91">to stay on social media there are some</text><text start="5720.62" dur="5.06">things you can do to do a better job</text><text start="5721.94" dur="5.97">which is let&apos;s say that you are</text><text start="5725.68" dur="5.23">politically aligned in a direction</text><text start="5727.91" dur="6.45">you&apos;re left aligned go find all of the</text><text start="5730.91" dur="4.8">right thinkers and follow them and join</text><text start="5734.36" dur="3.57">a bunch of those groups if you&apos;re right</text><text start="5735.71" dur="4.41">aligned do that with the left whatever</text><text start="5737.93" dur="4.38">your particular perspective is and find</text><text start="5740.12" dur="6.03">the ones that seem to be the most</text><text start="5742.31" dur="6.96">actually smart and earnest and then</text><text start="5746.15" dur="6.24">unfollow all the stuff that seems to be</text><text start="5749.27" dur="6.09">salacious and not well researched so</text><text start="5752.39" dur="4.74">that your feed becomes the smartest</text><text start="5755.36" dur="4.05">stuff from all of the perspectives and</text><text start="5757.13" dur="4.44">if this is working you&apos;ll become less</text><text start="5759.41" dur="4.44">certain about everything you&apos;ll know</text><text start="5761.57" dur="3.87">that it is working because you will know</text><text start="5763.85" dur="3.03">more than you knew before and you&apos;ll be</text><text start="5765.44" dur="4.14">less certain whereas right now you know</text><text start="5766.88" dur="5.01">less and you&apos;re more certain yeah that I</text><text start="5769.58" dur="4.65">think that&apos;s really powerful and the</text><text start="5771.89" dur="4.32">thing I I&apos;m really obsessed with this</text><text start="5774.23" dur="4.17">idea I want people to understand that</text><text start="5776.21" dur="5.06">what I normally say is skills have</text><text start="5778.4" dur="5.01">utility but information has utility and</text><text start="5781.27" dur="4.54">man I don&apos;t care</text><text start="5783.41" dur="4.5">from where on the political spectrum an</text><text start="5785.81" dur="3.84">idea comes from if it&apos;s real if it has</text><text start="5787.91" dur="4.23">real-world implications and it lets me</text><text start="5789.65" dur="5.37">move towards a goal that I have I&apos;m</text><text start="5792.14" dur="5.58">gonna take it and I actually cannot</text><text start="5795.02" dur="5.91">understand anything else</text><text start="5797.72" dur="6.18">so it&apos;s there they&apos;re powerful I didn&apos;t</text><text start="5800.93" dur="4.32">this all came for me because of building</text><text start="5803.9" dur="4.44">businesses like when your house is on</text><text start="5805.25" dur="4.68">the line you don&apos;t have time to worry</text><text start="5808.34" dur="2.94">about whether you thought of the idea or</text><text start="5809.93" dur="2.64">somebody else thought of the idea or</text><text start="5811.28" dur="2.43">somebody you like thought of it or</text><text start="5812.57" dur="3.09">somebody you don&apos;t like thought of it</text><text start="5813.71" dur="3.15">it&apos;s just like Jesus dude I don&apos;t wanna</text><text start="5815.66" dur="2.43">have to go home and tell my wife that we</text><text start="5816.86" dur="3.36">have to move out because we&apos;d lost the</text><text start="5818.09" dur="5.01">house like that was such a real thing</text><text start="5820.22" dur="4.44">for me and that kicked me into just a</text><text start="5823.1" dur="3.36">and I had already been sort of marching</text><text start="5824.66" dur="3.96">down that path but that kicked me into a</text><text start="5826.46" dur="3.63">whole nother level of like I just need</text><text start="5828.62" dur="3.33">to know what works man I need to know</text><text start="5830.09" dur="2.97">what works I have a goal I need to know</text><text start="5831.95" dur="5.73">what&apos;s gonna move me towards that goal</text><text start="5833.06" dur="6.75">and it also it felt better like there</text><text start="5837.68" dur="3.66">there&apos;s a sense of relaxing because I&apos;m</text><text start="5839.81" dur="3.36">not trying to posture I&apos;m not trying to</text><text start="5841.34" dur="3.45">campaign I used to say all the time and</text><text start="5843.17" dur="2.73">unfortunately I was wrong about this but</text><text start="5844.79" dur="3.09">I used to say all the time to people</text><text start="5845.9" dur="3.39">just be good because you can&apos;t campaign</text><text start="5847.88" dur="3.6">and convince people that you&apos;re good now</text><text start="5849.29" dur="3.63">the sad reality is you actually can you</text><text start="5851.48" dur="5.16">can bamboozle a lot of [ __ ] people</text><text start="5852.92" dur="6.42">with a lot of words but being good</text><text start="5856.64" dur="5.4">itself is gonna take you a lot farther</text><text start="5859.34" dur="5.64">and the getting people interested in</text><text start="5862.04" dur="5.91">that like gamifying in themselves like</text><text start="5864.98" dur="4.74">okay cool I want this curated feed that</text><text start="5867.95" dur="5.58">is bringing me a diverse array of</text><text start="5869.72" dur="6.24">opinions so that I can actually function</text><text start="5873.53" dur="3.84">and if people got into that idea of</text><text start="5875.96" dur="4.62">functioning but the goal here is to</text><text start="5877.37" dur="5.23">function it&apos;s to actually be useful to</text><text start="5880.58" dur="3.94">be able to</text><text start="5882.6" dur="3.3">so I define power very differently than</text><text start="5884.52" dur="2.73">you but the way that I define power and</text><text start="5885.9" dur="3.75">maybe it&apos;s just the wrong word at least</text><text start="5887.25" dur="4.14">for this conversation is power is being</text><text start="5889.65" dur="3.42">able to close your eyes imagine a world</text><text start="5891.39" dur="3.45">better than this one open your eyes and</text><text start="5893.07" dur="6.09">actually have the skills to move towards</text><text start="5894.84" dur="8.16">that to make that real and I have become</text><text start="5899.16" dur="6.03">so obsessed with that idea that it helps</text><text start="5903.0" dur="3.69">like that becomes almost the filter by</text><text start="5905.19" dur="3.51">which I make sense of the world like if</text><text start="5906.69" dur="3.45">I really think about like what&apos;s what&apos;s</text><text start="5908.7" dur="3.18">one of my highest level filters it&apos;s</text><text start="5910.14" dur="5.46">like I only do and believe that which</text><text start="5911.88" dur="5.94">moves me towards my goals and if you&apos;re</text><text start="5915.6" dur="4.41">good at choosing your goal then you</text><text start="5917.82" dur="4.14">suddenly become open to any good idea</text><text start="5920.01" dur="3.57">from wherever even if it contradicts</text><text start="5921.96" dur="3.42">like I came into it thinking one thing</text><text start="5923.58" dur="4.14">but like whoa that&apos;s actually more</text><text start="5925.38" dur="3.6">that&apos;s real that&apos;s actually going to</text><text start="5927.72" dur="4.2">take me it&apos;s not something I ever</text><text start="5928.98" dur="4.44">thought like I never thought that and I</text><text start="5931.92" dur="4.05">don&apos;t know enough about game B to know</text><text start="5933.42" dur="4.44">if like I&apos;m behind it or not but it&apos;s</text><text start="5935.97" dur="3.87">like hey if game B ends up being the</text><text start="5937.86" dur="4.95">most real thing and there is a way to</text><text start="5939.84" dur="5.03">deal with the just freakish amount of</text><text start="5942.81" dur="4.35">complexity and that we actually can</text><text start="5944.87" dur="7.3">consciously build something that moves</text><text start="5947.16" dur="6.56">us towards that and it becomes a my</text><text start="5952.17" dur="4.08">values would definitely be</text><text start="5953.72" dur="4.51">sustainability human well-being</text><text start="5956.25" dur="5.34">like those are sort of inextricably</text><text start="5958.23" dur="5.99">connected wanting the human race to go</text><text start="5961.59" dur="5.01">on long after I&apos;m here wanting people to</text><text start="5964.22" dur="5.02">struggle but struggle well so that they</text><text start="5966.6" dur="4.56">can be tough and be resilient like those</text><text start="5969.24" dur="4.47">are all things that to me seem</text><text start="5971.16" dur="3.72">inherently good more than say happiness</text><text start="5973.71" dur="6.18">or something like that which is very</text><text start="5974.88" dur="7.05">transient but like seeking out the</text><text start="5979.89" dur="4.44">things that will actually get me there</text><text start="5981.93" dur="4.17">and the process of iteration and at the</text><text start="5984.33" dur="3.81">risk of just completely derailed on</text><text start="5986.1" dur="4.38">tangents here that to me that sort of</text><text start="5988.14" dur="6.24">mixture of like iterate get it out there</text><text start="5990.48" dur="5.01">try be sincere in the pursuit of what&apos;s</text><text

dur="4.29">emotion by attacking your sense of</text><text start="6118.52" dur="5.76">rightness or whatever so having a</text><text start="6121.19" dur="4.59">fragile ego that wants to seem right and</text><text start="6124.28" dur="3.24">that is fragile II identified with</text><text start="6125.78" dur="4.95">certain positions makes you very very</text><text start="6127.52" dur="5.99">vulnerable to control so that&apos;s an</text><text start="6130.73" dur="7.23">important thing having a mindset where</text><text start="6133.51" dur="6.28">anything can be brought up and your</text><text start="6137.96" dur="3.78">identities not attached to specific</text><text start="6139.79" dur="4.14">belief structures the belief could</text><text start="6141.74" dur="6.56">change and you don&apos;t crumble as a result</text><text start="6143.93" dur="4.37">of it makes you much more resilient</text><text start="6148.34" dur="6.39">yeah resiliency is is one of those</text><text start="6152.54" dur="4.53">things from an intrinsic standpoint that</text><text start="6154.73" dur="3.84">if people want that in themselves and</text><text start="6157.07" dur="5.61">they&apos;re actually willing to put that to</text><text start="6158.57" dur="8.1">use you can begin to get anti fragile</text><text start="6162.68" dur="7.05">and anti fragility in terms of building</text><text start="6166.67" dur="4.92">a new society I know is a is going to be</text><text start="6169.73" dur="4.47">a pretty important thing do you think</text><text start="6171.59" dur="4.77">that we have any ideas that could</text><text start="6174.2" dur="3.15">actually cause so antifragility for</text><text start="6176.36" dur="2.7">anybody that&apos;s never heard the phrase</text><text start="6177.35" dur="5.7">before the more you attack it the</text><text start="6179.06" dur="6.36">stronger it becomes so what on earth</text><text start="6183.05" dur="4.08">would that look like at the societal</text><text start="6185.42" dur="7.59">level I I it is a failure of imagination</text><text start="6187.13" dur="10.86">for me I can&apos;t imagine it capitalism has</text><text start="6193.01" dur="12.0">been anti-federal as a system of</text><text start="6197.99" dur="11.25">resource distribution and etc it it has</text><text start="6205.01" dur="9.36">continued to evolve its capacities so we</text><text start="6209.24" dur="8.34">went from say barter to exchange</text><text start="6214.37" dur="5.1">mediated by currency to fiat currency to</text><text start="6217.58" dur="5.76">fractional reserve vehicles the attacks</text><text start="6219.47" dur="8.7">upon it that made it stronger well if</text><text start="6223.34" dur="6.51">one capitalist group say another nation</text><text start="6228.17" dur="3.66">or whatever was trying to advance their</text><text start="6229.85" dur="4.02">overall share of the pie relative to</text><text start="6231.83" dur="3.27">another one they kept each strengthening</text><text start="6233.87" dur="3.66">their underlying capitalist base</text><text start="6235.1" dur="6.15">becoming better at extraction exchange</text><text start="6237.53" dur="5.7">those types of things when communism was</text><text start="6241.25" dur="4.92">emerging as an alternate system it</text><text start="6243.23" dur="5.31">increased its capacity to be productive</text><text start="6246.17" dur="4.8">and defend itself and whatever so that&apos;s</text><text start="6248.54" dur="4.11">an example of antifragility you were</text><text start="6250.97" dur="4.59">asking earlier how does someone go from</text><text start="6252.65" dur="5.18">the forgiveness of Jesus to the to the</text><text start="6255.56" dur="5.43">Crusades there was a belief system</text><text start="6257.83" dur="5.5">Christianity they continued to get</text><text start="6260.99" dur="3.87">stronger and buy stronger it meant as it</text><text start="6263.33" dur="5.67">was attacked by other religious</text><text start="6264.86" dur="7.2">ideologies or or political ideologies it</text><text start="6269.0" dur="4.38">was increasing its and this actually</text><text start="6272.06" dur="2.91">interesting because anti fragile is not</text><text start="6273.38" dur="4.59">always good because sometimes it just</text><text start="6274.97" dur="5.39">means the thing is getting better at</text><text start="6277.97" dur="2.39">warfare</text><text start="6281.36" dur="7.43">I actually want to bring up the Trump</text><text start="6283.19" dur="10.41">campaign has elements of antifragility</text><text start="6288.79" dur="9.01">so whether it was stormy Daniels or the</text><text start="6293.6" dur="6.75">Russia issue or the impeachment his base</text><text start="6297.8" dur="4.71">actually got stronger through each of</text><text start="6300.35" dur="4.829">those and so one of the things that the</text><text start="6302.51" dur="4.35">left has not recognized they failed to</text><text start="6305.179" dur="3.871">recognize the antifragility and that</text><text start="6306.86" dur="5.299">they were lobbying attacks that would</text><text start="6309.05" dur="5.819">lose but would actually strengthen and</text><text start="6312.159" dur="3.941">so that&apos;s such an important thing to</text><text start="6314.869" dur="2.491">recognize because if something has</text><text start="6316.1" dur="2.639">become antique red jewel and you think</text><text start="6317.36" dur="5.04">it&apos;s bad you&apos;re going against it you</text><text start="6318.739" dur="6.0">have to think in a different way and</text><text start="6322.4" dur="3.719">actually I&apos;ll use Trump as an example</text><text start="6324.739" dur="8.67">here the thing you were mentioning</text><text start="6326.119" dur="12.031">around listening to diverse opinions so</text><text start="6333.409" dur="6.27">we we know that he&apos;s a different kind of</text><text start="6338.15" dur="4.38">president and the politically trained</text><text start="6339.679" dur="5.401">ones that have been there before whether</text><text start="6342.53" dur="4.32">people think that he is saving the</text><text start="6345.08" dur="4.17">nation from the corrupt evil deep state</text><text start="6346.85" dur="4.95">or whether he is destroying it to create</text><text start="6349.25" dur="4.32">his own evil dynasty is one of the</text><text start="6351.8" dur="2.79">classically polarized things that people</text><text start="6353.57" dur="2.85">have a hard time</text><text start="6354.59" dur="3.359">grounding enough they grounded in the</text><text start="6356.42" dur="4.41">thing that resonates is true to them</text><text start="6357.949" dur="4.5">without seeing the other things but I</text><text start="6360.83" dur="5.46">think everyone knows he&apos;s been effective</text><text start="6362.449" dur="6.511">at a particular thing I know a couple</text><text start="6366.29" dur="4.47">people who have been who worked with him</text><text start="6368.96" dur="4.409">closely been on the Security Council or</text><text start="6370.76" dur="3.66">you know in his advisory board who&apos;ve</text><text start="6373.369" dur="2.641">said the same thing about their</text><text start="6374.42" dur="3.81">experience working with him in the</text><text start="6376.01" dur="4.399">presidential or what said one same thing</text><text start="6378.23" dur="4.909">and I found very interesting is that</text><text start="6380.409" dur="5.31">where most of the president&apos;s previously</text><text start="6383.139" dur="5.23">had positions that were fairly</text><text start="6385.719" dur="4.361">consistent and predictable Bush did kind</text><text start="6388.369" dur="3.901">of Bush things and Obama did kind of</text><text start="6390.08" dur="4.139">Obama things and they got people around</text><text start="6392.27" dur="3.719">them that had a similar ideology and</text><text start="6394.219" dur="3.181">that had for some period of time right</text><text start="6395.989" dur="2.88">the Obama Democrats before they were</text><text start="6397.4" dur="3.0">Obama Democrats were Clinton Democrats</text><text start="6398.869" dur="5.461">they were of a certain type and same in</text><text start="6400.4" dur="7.65">Bush Republicans Trump got people who</text><text start="6404.33" dur="5.28">were mostly not of that of a particular</text><text start="6408.05" dur="3.06">lineage system and he got people who</text><text start="6409.61" dur="5.67">disagreed with each other via mentally</text><text start="6411.11" dur="6.09">and so if he would bring</text><text start="6415.28" dur="3.87">at Reyes into a room and Bannon into a</text><text start="6417.2" dur="3.78">room together to talk about China</text><text start="6419.15" dur="3.78">because they both knew more about it</text><text start="6420.98" dur="6.0">than he didn&apos;t he knew that but they</text><text start="6422.93" dur="5.91">disagreed vehemently then what they what</text><text start="6426.98" dur="4.14">I was told would happen in the room is</text><text start="6428.84" dur="4.11">that he would invite a group of people</text><text start="6431.12" dur="3.6">in without giving them any events notice</text><text start="6432.95" dur="3.36">of what they were going to talk about so</text><text start="6434.72" dur="3.48">they couldn&apos;t prepare how to manipulate</text><text start="6436.31" dur="4.08">while thinking so he got their</text><text start="6438.2" dur="3.78">extemporaneous real sense he brought in</text><text start="6440.39" dur="3.3">people who disagreed he would ask a</text><text start="6441.98" dur="3.54">question without giving an indication of</text><text start="6443.69" dur="3.45">what he thought he&apos;d keep a poker face</text><text start="6445.52" dur="3.81">on the whole time to not indicate that</text><text start="6447.14" dur="3.42">what he believed and you just keep</text><text start="6449.33" dur="3.54">asking questions and have them fight it</text><text start="6450.56" dur="3.66">out and and he would actually sit there</text><text start="6452.87" dur="4.95">quietly and listen for a couple hours</text><text start="6454.22" dur="4.77">and once he had heard enough then he</text><text start="6457.82" dur="4.38">still wouldn&apos;t tell them what he thought</text><text start="6458.99" dur="4.74">he&apos;d go straight to Twitter because he</text><text start="6462.2" dur="3.21">didn&apos;t care if they agreed with him or</text><text start="6463.73" dur="2.76">not he cared of his support base did and</text><text start="6465.41" dur="2.4">Twitter gave him an innocent way to</text><text start="6466.49" dur="3.63">communicate with the support base and</text><text start="6467.81" dur="4.23">get real-time analytics based on the big</text><text start="6470.12" dur="4.11">data analysis of the Twitter feed of</text><text start="6472.04" dur="5.61">whether what he was saying was</text><text start="6474.23" dur="6.87">coalescing his support base or not Wow</text><text start="6477.65" dur="5.46">and so that is an effective technology</text><text start="6481.1" dur="3.33">where what he&apos;s doing is listening to</text><text start="6483.11" dur="3.54">different viewpoints now he was</text><text start="6484.43" dur="3.51">listening for is not necessarily what is</text><text start="6486.65" dur="5.46">true but will be effective for</text><text start="6487.94" dur="6.72">coalescing my support base but he also</text><text start="6492.11" dur="4.56">had much more direct communication with</text><text start="6494.66" dur="3.75">people and much faster feedback now also</text><text start="6496.67" dur="3.27">when you don&apos;t have a position kind of</text><text start="6498.41" dur="2.97">like Bruce Lee said about martial arts</text><text start="6499.94" dur="4.11">right when you don&apos;t have a fixed form</text><text start="6501.38" dur="4.68">when you don&apos;t have rigorous positions</text><text start="6504.05" dur="3.63">you can take the position that is</text><text start="6506.06" dur="3.39">coalescing the support base empirical</text><text start="6507.68" dur="3.27">more which is both terrible and</text><text start="6509.45" dur="8.64">wonderful depending upon what your whole</text><text start="6510.95"
