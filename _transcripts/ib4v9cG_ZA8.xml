dur="3.84">where we really want to help the</text><text start="6.879" dur="4.081">homeless person that we&apos;re walking past</text><text start="8.8" dur="4.24">we really actually don&apos;t feel good about</text><text start="10.96" dur="3.679">our business to get to something that</text><text start="13.04" dur="2.96">doesn&apos;t matter that much having us walk</text><text start="14.639" dur="3.361">past another human that&apos;s actually</text><text start="16.0" dur="3.84">really hurting</text><text start="18.0" dur="3.84">and yet there&apos;s so many homeless people</text><text start="19.84" dur="3.519">and we could spend our whole life doing</text><text start="21.84" dur="3.12">it that way and not really touch it and</text><text start="23.359" dur="3.68">that&apos;s just one tiny issue and there&apos;s a</text><text start="24.96" dur="5.44">learned helplessness where</text><text start="27.039" dur="5.601">i don&apos;t feel like i can keep caring</text><text start="30.4" dur="5.6">in the same way if i can&apos;t act on the</text><text start="32.64" dur="4.16">care it&apos;s too devastating and so</text><text start="36.0" dur="3.2">i</text><text start="36.8" dur="4.56">start putting blinders on and i start</text><text start="39.2" dur="4.16">numbing in a particular way because i</text><text start="41.36" dur="4.4">can only care about stuff i can do stuff</text><text start="43.36" dur="6.8">about and it seems like i can do so</text><text start="45.76" dur="6.4">so both my impossibility to respond</text><text start="50.16" dur="4.399">and my impossibility to even make sense</text><text start="52.16" dur="4.079">of adequately well our my impossibility</text><text start="54.559" dur="4.8">to respond will have me turn sense</text><text start="56.239" dur="5.201">making off also my and care off my</text><text start="59.359" dur="6.561">inability to even make sense of things</text><text start="61.44" dur="4.48">will have me turn care off and so</text><text start="70.0" dur="4.88">i&apos;ll tell you a little bit about kind of</text><text start="72.159" dur="2.721">my process</text><text start="77.6" dur="2.159">i&apos;m</text><text start="78.56" dur="3.919">i&apos;m sharing</text><text start="79.759" dur="4.801">some things that i&apos;ve come</text><text start="82.479" dur="5.28">to understand or how i see things as a</text><text start="84.56" dur="5.12">result of you know somewhat long curve</text><text start="87.759" dur="3.68">of really trying to make sense of what</text><text start="89.68" dur="2.56">the problems are in the world</text><text start="91.439" dur="2.801">but</text><text start="92.24" dur="3.68">i started with much smaller definition</text><text start="94.24" dur="3.04">of the problems right it was like it</text><text start="95.92" dur="3.519">started for me that the problem was</text><text start="97.28" dur="3.68">factory farms</text><text start="99.439" dur="3.761">and then it expanded to know we actually</text><text start="100.96" dur="4.08">do up stuff to lots of animals</text><text start="103.2" dur="3.52">and then like and it kept expanding in</text><text start="105.04" dur="3.6">steps as i would work with it but at</text><text start="106.72" dur="4.32">each step there was a devastation of</text><text start="108.64" dur="4.0">both how horrific and how huge the</text><text start="111.04" dur="2.719">problem was</text><text start="112.64" dur="3.119">and then</text><text start="113.759" dur="4.32">based on that sense making and the care</text><text start="115.759" dur="4.72">and then there was an up leveling of</text><text start="118.079" dur="4.561">okay well what could i do to help this</text><text start="120.479" dur="3.92">and a kind of agency that would emerge</text><text start="122.64" dur="3.6">but then as i would work with the</text><text start="124.399" dur="3.281">solution that emerged i would realize it</text><text start="126.24" dur="2.879">wasn&apos;t a real solution because the</text><text start="127.68" dur="2.719">problem was actually deeper and bigger</text><text start="129.119" dur="3.681">than i was thinking it was and i was</text><text start="130.399" dur="3.2">solving the wrong problem</text><text start="132.8" dur="2.88">so</text><text start="133.599" dur="4.081">okay we&apos;re going to work and put the</text><text start="135.68" dur="3.44">fences around the elephant preserve so</text><text start="137.68" dur="2.96">the poachers can&apos;t get to them to</text><text start="139.12" dur="4.4">protect the elephants</text><text start="140.64" dur="4.8">but given that even when we so we</text><text start="143.52" dur="3.92">succeed at that but we haven&apos;t addressed</text><text start="145.44" dur="3.439">the poverty of the poachers who can&apos;t</text><text start="147.44" dur="3.28">feed their kids any other way and we</text><text start="148.879" dur="3.841">haven&apos;t addressed a macro economy that</text><text start="150.72" dur="4.239">creates poverty because of a power law</text><text start="152.72" dur="4.799">distribution on wealth and we haven&apos;t</text><text start="154.959" dur="4.0">created affected the mindset towards</text><text start="157.519" dur="3.44">animals and we haven&apos;t affected</text><text start="158.959" dur="3.601">population dynamics and all those things</text><text start="160.959" dur="3.441">and so</text><text start="162.56" dur="3.12">as a result when we succeed at</text><text start="164.4" dur="3.68">protecting the elephants because the</text><text start="165.68" dur="3.839">fences go up the poachers move to start</text><text start="168.08" dur="2.96">hunting the white rhino that&apos;s more</text><text start="169.519" dur="2.961">endangered than the mountain gorilla</text><text start="171.04" dur="3.36">right this was an actual experience i</text><text start="172.48" dur="4.56">had when i was 13 working with activism</text><text start="174.4" dur="4.64">project and i&apos;m like wow</text><text start="177.04" dur="3.44">the best solution</text><text start="179.04" dur="2.96">because it didn&apos;t understand the problem</text><text start="180.48" dur="3.119">well enough actually made a worse</text><text start="182.0" dur="3.76">problem it moved the harm to a more</text><text start="183.599" dur="4.401">sensitive area</text><text start="185.76" dur="4.399">so then understand the larger definition</text><text start="188.0" dur="3.84">of the problem and then try to work on a</text><text start="190.159" dur="3.281">solution there and that would happen</text><text start="191.84" dur="2.88">again and so then that took me on a</text><text start="193.44" dur="3.439">process to</text><text start="194.72" dur="3.84">kind of the maximum abstraction of</text><text start="196.879" dur="2.72">generator functions of all the things</text><text start="198.56" dur="3.12">right</text><text start="199.599" dur="3.28">but at each step as there was a deeper</text><text start="201.68" dur="2.96">understanding of the nature of the</text><text start="202.879" dur="4.64">problems there was a while before there</text><text start="204.64" dur="5.04">was a up leveling of a sense of agency</text><text start="207.519" dur="4.401">now if i&apos;m going straight to the most</text><text start="209.68" dur="3.919">abstract and general case there aren&apos;t</text><text start="211.92" dur="3.28">all those steps of the up leveling of</text><text start="213.599" dur="3.601">agency and then there&apos;s going to be like</text><text start="215.2" dur="4.56">oh i went from thinking about what</text><text start="217.2" dur="3.52">i could do with a community garden</text><text start="219.76" dur="2.479">to</text><text start="220.72" dur="4.32">you know</text><text start="222.239" dur="5.201">how do we deal with the nature of how</text><text start="225.04" dur="4.32">human scents make technology differently</text><text start="227.44" dur="3.28">and rivalrous dynamics writ large</text><text start="229.36" dur="3.599">globally</text><text start="230.72" dur="4.32">and so something i can say is like so</text><text start="232.959" dur="3.521">part of my process</text><text start="235.04" dur="3.759">this may or may not be relevant for</text><text start="236.48" dur="3.2">anybody but part of my process was</text><text start="238.799" dur="1.841">in</text><text start="239.68" dur="4.24">facing</text><text start="240.64" dur="6.0">the actual situation of the world was</text><text start="243.92" dur="4.0">there were a few vows that i made</text><text start="246.64" dur="3.92">when i was pretty young actually as a</text><text start="247.92" dur="4.56">teenager the first vowel was</text><text start="250.56" dur="4.879">that i would never turn away from the</text><text start="252.48" dur="3.999">pain of the world like like decide i&apos;m</text><text start="255.439" dur="2.401">not gonna</text><text start="256.479" dur="2.801">um</text><text start="257.84" dur="3.04">go to the factory farm and i have an</text><text start="259.28" dur="3.68">opportunity or</text><text start="260.88" dur="5.599">avoid the poor area or turn off the peta</text><text start="262.96" dur="5.36">video that i wanted to actually see</text><text start="266.479" dur="3.201">the world that i lived in and what was</text><text start="268.32" dur="4.4">going on</text><text start="269.68" dur="6.4">because i didn&apos;t want to be able to</text><text start="272.72" dur="4.72">be live in a blind bubble right</text><text start="276.08" dur="2.88">so that was the first vowel and then the</text><text start="277.44" dur="4.0">second vowel of course when you start to</text><text start="278.96" dur="4.799">do that you&apos;re it&apos;s devastating</text><text start="281.44" dur="5.44">and so then the next vowel was to feel</text><text start="283.759" dur="3.121">all of it and not go numb</text><text start="287.68" dur="4.4">and then the next vowel was to knock if</text><text start="289.919" dur="4.961">if not going numb not getting stuck in</text><text start="292.08" dur="4.72">anger and blame</text><text start="294.88" dur="4.08">and then the next vowel was to also not</text><text start="296.8" dur="4.16">get stuck in hopelessness or overwhelm</text><text start="298.96" dur="3.76">those were all basically unacceptable</text><text start="300.96" dur="4.16">choices</text><text start="302.72" dur="4.0">so the first one of i just won&apos;t look at</text><text start="305.12" dur="2.96">the problems i will live in a tiny</text><text start="306.72" dur="2.96">bubble where i get to feel like i&apos;m</text><text start="308.08" dur="3.2">succeeding while there&apos;s massive</text><text start="309.68" dur="3.76">suffering and torture happening is a</text><text start="311.28" dur="4.32">kind of dissociation that makes me as if</text><text start="313.44" dur="4.64">a sociopath right i&apos;m stoked</text><text start="315.6" dur="4.24">there&apos;s huge pain in the world but i</text><text start="318.08" dur="3.6">don&apos;t have to care about it so i&apos;m like</text><text start="319.84" dur="4.0">all right that doesn&apos;t work</text><text start="321.68" dur="4.079">and going</text><text start="323.84" dur="3.28">numb getting stuck in blame or getting</text><text start="325.759" dur="4.321">overwhelmed doesn&apos;t work so it&apos;s like</text><text start="327.12" dur="4.72">the only way through</text><text start="330.08" dur="4.64">is to say i&apos;m gonna feel it all i&apos;m</text><text start="331.84" dur="5.199">gonna recognize that the devastation the</text><text start="334.72" dur="4.88">anger whatever is a result of love which</text><text start="337.039" dur="3.841">is if i didn&apos;t love the animals if i</text><text start="339.6" dur="2.8">didn&apos;t love the kids if i didn&apos;t love</text><text start="340.88" dur="2.96">the environment if it wasn&apos;t beautiful</text><text start="342.4" dur="3.6">to me i wouldn&apos;t care that it was being</text><text start="343.84" dur="4.639">harmed but underneath every one of</text><text start="346.0" dur="4.72">underneath the fear the anger everything</text><text start="348.479" dur="4.72">is a reality that is so beautiful that i</text><text start="350.72" dur="4.24">love which is why i care</text><text start="353.199" dur="3.201">so then i trace it back to the love and</text><text start="354.96" dur="3.28">i feel that</text><text start="356.4" dur="3.359">and i also tune in not just to the</text><text start="358.24" dur="3.6">tragedies that are happening and could</text><text start="359.759" dur="4.961">happen but also to the intrinsic beauty</text><text start="361.84" dur="5.44">and meaningfulness of life</text><text start="364.72" dur="3.599">and then i say okay i have some agency i</text><text start="367.28" dur="2.479">don&apos;t have</text><text start="368.319" dur="3.201">god&apos;s</text><text start="369.759" dur="5.761">you know omnipotence but i have some</text><text start="371.52" dur="6.16">agency so what do i do</text><text start="375.52" dur="4.0">with that agency in service of what i</text><text start="377.68" dur="4.16">care about</text><text start="379.52" dur="2.32">and</text><text start="383.44" dur="3.52">you know</text><text start="385.28" dur="3.199">every time i</text><text start="386.96" dur="2.32">meet a nurse</text><text start="388.479" dur="2.961">who&apos;s</text><text start="389.28" dur="5.12">who actually really cares about the</text><text start="391.44" dur="4.56">people that she&apos;s nursing and makes the</text><text start="394.4" dur="3.6">pain of what they&apos;re experiencing when</text><text start="396.0" dur="3.759">they go to the hospital less painful has</text><text start="398.0" dur="3.84">them feel cared about</text><text start="399.759" dur="3.361">like i feel this</text><text start="401.84" dur="3.44">i feel this</text><text start="403.12" dur="4.96">kind of existential relief that she&apos;s</text><text start="405.28" dur="4.72">doing that</text><text start="408.08" dur="4.48">he&apos;s doing that and every time i find</text><text start="410.0" dur="4.4">someone who is tending to street dogs in</text><text start="412.56" dur="4.24">tijuana</text><text start="414.4" dur="4.32">or anything even if it&apos;s not addressing</text><text start="416.8" dur="3.839">the generator functions of x-risk like</text><text start="418.72" dur="3.52">all those things matter</text><text start="420.639" dur="4.321">and for a lot of people they will</text><text start="422.24" dur="4.399">understand the big picture and they&apos;ll</text><text start="424.96" dur="3.359">say i&apos;m glad some people are working on</text><text start="426.639" dur="4.241">it i care about all of it but based on</text><text start="428.319" dur="4.481">the sense making i currently have and</text><text start="430.88" dur="3.68">based on what i know how to do this is</text><text start="432.8" dur="2.959">where i can actually add</text><text start="434.56" dur="3.6">value</text><text start="435.759" dur="4.16">and the last thing i would want to do is</text><text start="438.16" dur="3.12">have is have the nature of my</text><text start="439.919" dur="4.081">communication</text><text start="441.28"

take them no</text><text start="448.639" dur="3.68">i want people to feel deeply motivated</text><text start="450.56" dur="2.639">to do the things that they actually can</text><text start="452.319" dur="4.091">do</text><text start="453.199" dur="4.481">that are expressions of their care</text><text start="456.41" dur="2.39">[Music]</text><text start="457.68" dur="3.6">and</text><text start="458.8" dur="5.2">some people will be oriented to the kind</text><text start="461.28" dur="4.72">of abstractions to say well how would we</text><text start="464.0" dur="3.919">build a new resource provisioning system</text><text start="466.0" dur="4.479">a new economics that reverse that</text><text start="467.919" dur="4.72">removes perverse incentive</text><text start="470.479" dur="3.601">or a new collective intelligence system</text><text start="472.639" dur="3.68">that doesn&apos;t have some of the failings</text><text start="474.08" dur="4.799">of our existing governance systems</text><text start="476.319" dur="4.481">and</text><text start="478.879" dur="4.0">so the people who are called to</text><text start="480.8" dur="3.679">abstractions and to</text><text
