start="107.46" dur="6.53">today&apos;s conversation every time we have</text><text start="109.14" dur="7.619">a conversation I leave feeling like I</text><text start="113.99" dur="6.129">definitely having learned definitely</text><text start="116.759" dur="7.951">having learned and today we&apos;re gonna dig</text><text start="120.119" dur="6.631">into being versus doing I think a lot of</text><text start="124.71" dur="3.329">people one of the reasons I want to</text><text start="126.75" dur="6.51">bring this up is this is something I&apos;ve</text><text start="128.039" dur="8.071">been working on myself and being in a</text><text start="133.26" dur="6.09">culture and society where so much value</text><text start="136.11" dur="6.629">is putting on what we do and even when</text><text start="139.35" dur="6.24">I&apos;m asked or we ask children what do you</text><text start="142.739" dur="4.83">want to be when you grow up they the</text><text start="145.59" dur="5.16">answer ends up being a doing answer</text><text start="147.569" dur="4.861">versus a being answer even though the</text><text start="150.75" dur="4.2">question is being and so we get this</text><text start="152.43" dur="4.32">association you know what do you want to</text><text start="154.95" dur="5.46">be when you grow up it&apos;s like oh I want</text><text start="156.75" dur="6.48">to be and then they name the job which</text><text start="160.41" dur="5.88">is interesting something that&apos;s come to</text><text start="163.23" dur="5.7">my attention recently I watch kids only</text><text start="166.29" dur="4.62">be a firefighter or an astronaut that</text><text start="168.93" dur="5.49">seems like a very doing thing would you</text><text start="170.91" dur="7.68">agree that that&apos;s that&apos;s just how our</text><text start="174.42" dur="7.92">culture has been molding us up to this</text><text start="178.59" dur="5.67">point oh yeah and it goes deeper than</text><text start="182.34" dur="4.23">that not only is it a doing thing it&apos;s</text><text start="184.26" dur="4.53">one very specific specialist role and</text><text start="186.57" dur="3.6">it&apos;s a specialist role that is usually</text><text start="188.79" dur="5.16">related to how they&apos;re gonna make money</text><text start="190.17" dur="5.58">and so it&apos;s what do you want to be when</text><text start="193.95" dur="3.72">you grow up first it takes them out of</text><text start="195.75" dur="6.12">the moment into the future</text><text start="197.67" dur="6.39">it takes them into wanting to develop</text><text start="201.87" dur="5.76">who they are right in the framing of</text><text start="204.06" dur="5.7">their essence as a job so you can look</text><text start="207.63" dur="4.5">at how that is the effect of</text><text start="209.76" dur="4.74">macroeconomics forming people to be</text><text start="212.13" dur="3.889">effective cogs in that system there&apos;s a</text><text start="214.5" dur="4.13">whole bunch of things going on right</text><text start="216.019" dur="6.19">being in doing is definitely one of them</text><text start="218.63" dur="7.469">as you&apos;re as you&apos;re exploring that</text><text start="222.209" dur="6.0">inquiry yourself if we reframe it to</text><text start="226.099" dur="4.421">something like who do you want to be</text><text start="228.209" dur="4.581">rather than what do you want</text><text start="230.52" dur="4.59">here what do you want to do what the</text><text start="232.79" dur="7.12">what comes up for you as meaningful</text><text start="235.11" dur="10.14">answers to that I want to be honest</text><text start="239.91" dur="7.98">trustworthy want to be a community be an</text><text start="245.25" dur="5.04">asset to the community and and that</text><text start="247.89" dur="5.64">things like that things more along the</text><text start="250.29" dur="5.85">lines of characters or not characters</text><text start="253.53" dur="5.429">but yeah what what uh what&apos;s the value</text><text start="256.14" dur="7.35">of my character am i I somebody who</text><text start="258.959" dur="9.811">tells the truth things like that and how</text><text start="263.49" dur="6.78">does it relate for you to what that</text><text start="268.77" dur="3.96">character is doing what is the</text><text start="270.27" dur="5.88">relationship those qualities of being</text><text start="272.73" dur="6.74">and doing it&apos;s some but it&apos;s something I</text><text start="276.15" dur="6.12">can do it&apos;s something I can be right now</text><text start="279.47" dur="6.76">it&apos;s not uh it&apos;s not even it&apos;s something</text><text start="282.27" dur="7.2">that aspire to as it as choice you know</text><text start="286.23" dur="5.43">I can just I want people to trust me</text><text start="289.47" dur="4.52">then I know that I need to behave with</text><text start="291.66" dur="2.33">integrity</text><text start="296.949" dur="6.43">there&apos;s a number of embedded dialectics</text><text start="300.199" dur="5.521">or dichotomies here there&apos;s now versus</text><text start="303.379" dur="4.41">later so you said this is something I</text><text start="305.72" dur="4.74">can be now versus something that&apos;s</text><text start="307.789" dur="4.981">aspirational in the future and there&apos;s</text><text start="310.46" dur="4.29">something that is more around qualities</text><text start="312.77" dur="4.41">of character versus specific types of</text><text start="314.75" dur="6.139">action someone can show up with</text><text start="317.18" dur="7.53">integrity as a artist or as an inventor</text><text start="320.889" dur="6.101">or as a entrepreneur or as a mother</text><text start="324.71" dur="4.29">right lots of different roles and those</text><text start="326.99" dur="4.709">roles are meaningful they are deep and</text><text start="329.0" dur="4.8">meaningful to who that unique being and</text><text start="331.699" dur="7.111">their expression and their Dharma and</text><text start="333.8" dur="6.239">their purposes and then there&apos;s also the</text><text start="338.81" dur="3.81">difference between the qualities of</text><text start="340.039" dur="4.41">character of how other people feel in</text><text start="342.62" dur="3.71">relationship with them and their own</text><text start="344.449" dur="4.921">quality of experience how they&apos;ve</text><text start="346.33" dur="5.5">experienced life yeah and so when you</text><text start="349.37" dur="5.07">look at the fact that we have choice</text><text start="351.83" dur="4.11">over our own experience and we also have</text><text start="354.44" dur="3.539">choice over how we affect the experience</text><text start="355.94" dur="3.93">of others right all of that kind of</text><text start="357.979" dur="3.93">shows up here so there&apos;s something</text><text start="359.87" dur="4.729">around optimizing the relationship</text><text start="361.909" dur="5.19">between all these dialectics our own</text><text start="364.599" dur="4.0">acting in ways that optimize our own</text><text start="367.099" dur="2.82">experience and the experience of</text><text start="368.599" dur="4.801">everyone and everything that we touch in</text><text start="369.919" dur="5.761">effect showing up right now in the</text><text start="373.4" dur="5.73">fullest way we can now and in a way that</text><text start="375.68" dur="7.22">optimizes our growth trajectory into the</text><text start="379.13" dur="6.029">future and qualities of being and</text><text start="382.9" dur="4.359">specific types of doing that are both</text><text start="385.159" dur="6.991">aligned with each other and the deepest</text><text start="387.259" dur="6.331">aspect of who we are yeah I think it&apos;s</text><text start="392.15" dur="7.71">challenging sometimes to think about</text><text start="393.59" dur="7.65">what it is that we do I find that</text><text start="399.86" dur="4.89">sometimes there&apos;s a challenge between</text><text start="401.24" dur="5.25">who we are or who we want to be and who</text><text start="404.75" dur="5.25">were showing up how was showing up in</text><text start="406.49" dur="5.789">the world for others and I&apos;ve had</text><text start="410.0" dur="4.56">conversations with others and then I&apos;ve</text><text start="412.279" dur="6.75">had this internal conversation with</text><text start="414.56" dur="10.26">myself around am i showing up for the</text><text start="419.029" dur="7.471">purpose of am i doing this I tell myself</text><text start="424.82" dur="2.909">and I&apos;ve watched other people tell</text><text start="426.5" dur="3.72">themselves they&apos;re doing this because</text><text start="427.729" dur="5.251">they love other people like</text><text start="430.22" dur="5.94">I&apos;m doing doing this out of love when in</text><text start="432.98" dur="8.52">reality it&apos;s the motivation is born out</text><text start="436.16" dur="6.9">of out of need in that if I am NOT this</text><text start="441.5" dur="4.44">way or I don&apos;t behave this way or I</text><text start="443.06" dur="5.76">don&apos;t do these things then this person</text><text start="445.94" dur="6.45">won&apos;t love and accept me and so we end</text><text start="448.82" dur="6.6">up in this we end up in this place where</text><text start="452.39" dur="4.98">I either have to behave the way other</text><text start="455.42" dur="5.16">people want me to behave in order to be</text><text start="457.37" dur="5.96">liked or I do whatever I want to do and</text><text start="460.58" dur="8.49">no one&apos;s gonna like me I can&apos;t do both</text><text start="463.33" dur="7.84">that seems to be a reality that&apos;s being</text><text start="469.07" dur="6.62">created for a lot of people and a</text><text start="471.17" dur="4.52">reality I&apos;ve had to wrestle with myself</text><text start="477.37" dur="4.33">so we have more things where you have</text><text start="480.29" dur="3.41">two different things that are both</text><text start="481.7" dur="6.15">meaningful framed as being dichotomous</text><text start="483.7" dur="7.36">right so you have your individuality and</text><text start="487.85" dur="5.94">your authenticity and your sovereignty</text><text start="491.06" dur="6.09">on one side which is who do I really</text><text start="493.79" dur="5.85">just want to be for myself and this is</text><text start="497.15" dur="5.66">prima facie meaningful right obviously</text><text start="499.64" dur="7.46">meaningful and then you have the</text><text start="502.81" dur="7.39">relationship connection communion side</text><text start="507.1" dur="5.89">which is how do I show up in a way that</text><text start="510.2" dur="4.05">is enriching to other people so that</text><text start="512.99" dur="2.76">they also want to show up with me</text><text start="514.25" dur="3.12">because this so much of what&apos;s</text><text start="515.75" dur="4.11">meaningful that only expresses itself</text><text start="517.37" dur="6.54">interpersonally which is obviously also</text><text start="519.86" dur="7.47">meaningful if we believe that there is</text><text start="523.91" dur="6.27">an inexorable that cauda me between</text><text start="527.33" dur="4.59">those where we have to sacrifice who we</text><text start="530.18" dur="3.38">actually are for a relationship or</text><text start="531.92" dur="5.63">sacrifice relationship to be who we are</text><text start="533.56" dur="3.99">then life will suck and</text><text start="538.38" dur="4.5">it&apos;s not actually true it is true that</text><text start="541.14" dur="3.45">those are poles but they&apos;re poles that</text><text start="542.88" dur="4.35">are actually complementary and when</text><text start="544.59" dur="5.16">navigated properly are symbiotic with</text><text start="547.23" dur="5.43">each other that you being who you</text><text start="549.75" dur="4.02">actually are and you relating with other</text><text start="552.66" dur="2.97">people in the way that creates most</text><text start="553.77" dur="3.63">meaningful relationship are symbiotic</text><text start="555.63" dur="3.06">now you might be in a relationship with</text><text start="557.4" dur="2.46">someone where they want you to behave a</text><text start="558.69" dur="2.58">certain way because you kind of made</text><text start="559.86" dur="2.91">that contract with them where from the</text><text start="561.27" dur="2.76">beginning you acted a way that you</text><text start="562.77" dur="2.85">thought that they wanted that was never</text><text start="564.03" dur="3.21">true to who you were to get something</text><text start="565.62" dur="3.9">from them where the whole thing is a</text><text start="567.24" dur="3.42">bullshit commodities exchange but that</text><text start="569.52" dur="3.21">just might be an unauthentic</text><text start="570.66" dur="3.42">relationship to begin with would you say</text><text start="572.73" dur="2.79">that a lot of people have that</text><text start="574.08" dur="4.74">relationship with their parents</text><text start="575.52" dur="4.83">sure defect though most people have that</text><text start="578.82" dur="3.69">relationship with their parents if their</text><text start="580.35" dur="4.26">parents weren&apos;t really focused on</text><text start="582.51" dur="4.83">facilitating those people being who they</text><text start="584.61" dur="6.15">actually authentically were which is not</text><text start="587.34" dur="6.0">most parents right and so then they are</text><text start="590.76" dur="8.25">being who they think their parents need</text><text start="593.34" dur="9.11">them to be and this is why they don&apos;t</text><text start="599.01" dur="7.56">like going home for the holidays right</text><text start="602.45" dur="5.35">now there&apos;s then one can rebel and say</text><text start="606.57" dur="6.39">I&apos;m gonna be whoever the fuck I want to</text><text start="607.8" dur="6.6">be and lose connection or they can</text><text start="612.96" dur="3.54">sacrifice who they are and their</text><text start="614.4" dur="3.63">authenticity in a codependent way for a</text><text start="616.5" dur="5.22">connection that isn&apos;t real connection at</text><text start="618.03" dur="5.61">pseudo connection or they can see what</text><text start="621.72" dur="3.78">is the authentic overlap between who my</text><text start="623.64" dur="3.63">parents actually are who I actually am</text><text start="625.5" dur="4.38">what is the what is the overlap of that</text><text start="627.27" dur="4.35">Venn diagram that&apos;s authentic and let&apos;s</text><text start="629.88" dur="5.97">see how we can explore that let&apos;s see</text><text start="631.62" dur="6.75">how we can expand it yeah what what</text><text start="635.85" dur="5.7">would you say to somebody who say grew</text><text start="638.37" dur="5.43">up and I was just talking someone</text><text start="641.55" dur="6.0">earlier today who grew up in the Mormon</text><text start="643.8" dur="6.21">religion and then they leave that</text><text start="647.55" dur="3.93">religion and when we look at that Venn</text><text start="650.01" dur="4.59">diagram there&apos;s really not a lot of</text><text start="651.48" dur="7.5">overlap or maybe there is overlap but</text><text start="654.6" dur="8.52">it&apos;s it&apos;s very difficult to find how do</text><text start="658.98" dur="6.15">you go how do you go about do we do we&apos;d</text><text start="663.12" dur="4.67">need to reconcile those relationships is</text><text start="665.13" dur="6.569">that something that we owe other people</text><text start="667.79" dur="8.079">so we talked about being I</text><text start="671.699" dur="6.51">environment I think you do to where the</text><text start="675.869" dur="5.4">new the relationships that are new are</text><text start="678.209" dur="5.04">easy to get into because we&apos;re showing</text><text start="681.269" dur="4.461">up as our most authentic selves more</text><text start="683.249" dur="4.74">than we ever have before and so there&apos;s</text><text start="685.73" dur="2.909">you start the relationship without the</text><text start="687.989" dur="4.65">bullshit</text><text start="688.639" dur="7.091">but a relationship that where you grew</text><text start="692.639" dur="5.13">up with it and now is it something worth</text><text start="695.73" dur="5.25">cutting away later on in life and</text><text start="697.769" dur="6.29">cutting people out or is it something do</text><text start="700.98" dur="3.079">we ople something</text><text start="706.73" dur="5.76">I think there&apos;s another way to ask if</text><text start="710.0" dur="7.05">that&apos;s more insightful it&apos;s not do we</text><text start="712.49" dur="7.56">owe our parents in obligatory false</text><text start="717.05" dur="5.67">relationship which is not actually very</text><text start="720.05" dur="6.599">meaningful for anyone or on the other</text><text start="722.72" dur="8.07">side do we just cut it out I think one</text><text start="726.649" dur="5.851">meaningful question is as we are</text><text start="730.79" dur="4.979">interacting with our parents can we feel</text><text start="732.5" dur="6.029">comfortable being who we are hmm without</text><text start="735.769" dur="4.411">needing their approval and without</text><text start="738.529" dur="3.721">needing them to understand us and agree</text><text start="740.18" dur="7.08">with us and can we let them be who they</text><text start="742.25" dur="7.019">are and even if they can&apos;t even if they</text><text start="747.26"

start="840.71" dur="6.36">yeah so coming back to I just want to</text><text start="845.33" dur="4.5">dive in just the definition of this</text><text start="847.07" dur="9.57">which is we talked about states of being</text><text start="849.83" dur="9.75">and and I personally been looking at you</text><text start="856.64" dur="5.22">know doing versus being and you know I</text><text start="859.58" dur="4.86">think a lot of us in the Western culture</text><text start="861.86" dur="5.52">consider we go oh if I do these things</text><text start="864.44" dur="5.67">then I&apos;ll be this person and then we do</text><text start="867.38" dur="5.64">those things and then we and we gonna</text><text start="870.11" dur="4.68">become a piece of this person we thought</text><text start="873.02" dur="4.65">we would become once we do these things</text><text start="874.79" dur="7.65">and now we have to do more things in</text><text start="877.67" dur="7.35">order to feel good and I&apos;ve been</text><text start="882.44" dur="4.05">investigating the possibility of going</text><text start="885.02" dur="4.319">straight to being and then once you</text><text start="886.49" dur="5.039">become the person that you want to be or</text><text start="889.339" dur="3.961">the person you were you remember the</text><text start="891.529" dur="6.481">person you were before you were</text><text start="893.3" dur="7.229">imprinted you become this person that</text><text start="898.01" dur="5.13">has that is this being and this being</text><text start="900.529" dur="7.791">just does the things that they&apos;re</text><text start="903.14" dur="8.01">supposed to do or it just unfolds easily</text><text start="908.32" dur="4.78">so a lot of my focus has been around how</text><text start="911.15" dur="4.35">can I be different without focusing on</text><text start="913.1" dur="6.54">the doing first and then coming from a</text><text start="915.5" dur="6.51">lifetime of being taught that you do to</text><text start="919.64" dur="5.97">become and now I&apos;m going in Reverse</text><text start="922.01" dur="7.89">going okay I want to be different and I</text><text start="925.61" dur="8.25">need to go and and can the motivation</text><text start="929.9" dur="5.879">and is the motivation pure it&apos;s like do</text><text start="933.86" dur="3.93">I want to be so that I can do and in</text><text start="935.779" dur="3.721">which case is that even possible or do</text><text start="937.79" dur="4.26">it do I need to have the pure motivation</text><text start="939.5" dur="5.19">of look I want to be for the purpose of</text><text start="942.05" dur="5.5">being and being authentic and then I</text><text start="944.69" dur="4.45">need to trust</text><text start="947.55" dur="6.17">trust them the uncertainty of what that</text><text start="949.14" dur="6.81">looks like when the doing happens mm-hmm</text><text start="953.72" dur="4.33">there&apos;s a bunch of elements kind of</text><text start="955.95" dur="3.09">wrapped up in there let&apos;s let&apos;s pull</text><text start="958.05" dur="7.62">them apart and see if we can address</text><text start="959.04" dur="10.799">them I&apos;d actually like to address the</text><text start="965.67" dur="5.7">topic of dichotomy and paradox a little</text><text start="969.839" dur="4.261">bit more essentially because it&apos;s right</text><text start="971.37" dur="4.29">at the heart here of is being really</text><text start="974.1" dur="4.739">what we care about we actually care</text><text start="975.66" dur="5.94">about who we are character-wise or we</text><text start="978.839" dur="5.19">care about our state of experience right</text><text start="981.6" dur="4.53">and all the doing is really just so we</text><text start="984.029" dur="3.781">can be happy or good or something and if</text><text start="986.13" dur="3.269">we&apos;re there already then how do we have</text><text start="987.81" dur="3.66">any idea what we would do and who cares</text><text start="989.399" dur="3.541">and does it matter or is doing really</text><text start="991.47" dur="3.27">relevant because we&apos;re actually evolving</text><text start="992.94" dur="3.75">the world and we have a role to play and</text><text start="994.74" dur="4.98">what is the relationship between those</text><text start="996.69" dur="5.01">and is there causal influence both ways</text><text start="999.72" dur="8.609">does doing affect being and being effect</text><text start="1001.7" dur="9.12">doing and can they be recursive and so</text><text start="1008.329" dur="6.421">think about this very simple analogy but</text><text start="1010.82" dur="7.05">the analogies illustrative to think</text><text start="1014.75" dur="4.77">about a cylinder a cylinder is a three</text><text start="1017.87" dur="3.0">dimensional object it&apos;s a very simple</text><text start="1019.52" dur="2.939">three dimensional object we&apos;re used to</text><text start="1020.87" dur="3.6">thinking in three dimensions three</text><text start="1022.459" dur="4.261">spatial dimensions so it&apos;s an easy thing</text><text start="1024.47" dur="3.989">to think about but if you imagine a two</text><text start="1026.72" dur="4.92">dimensional creature right a plane on</text><text start="1028.459" dur="5.581">plane or creature they can&apos;t see a</text><text start="1031.64" dur="4.89">cylinder they can see a two-dimensional</text><text start="1034.04" dur="4.2">slice of it now there&apos;s an infinite</text><text start="1036.53" dur="3.029">number of two-dimensional slices since</text><text start="1038.24" dur="3.66">they&apos;re infinitely thin that stack on</text><text start="1039.559" dur="4.321">top of each other to actually make the</text><text start="1041.9" dur="3.6">thing up so they&apos;re actually reducing</text><text

reduction so they</text><text start="1050.84" dur="4.98">slice the cylinder one way and they get</text><text start="1053.0" dur="5.07">a circle and it&apos;s very clear that the</text><text start="1055.82" dur="4.38">reality they&apos;re seeing it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="1058.07" dur="4.38">passing through their space as a circle</text><text start="1060.2" dur="4.44">if it passed through perpendicular to</text><text start="1062.45" dur="5.46">that they&apos;d get a rectangle right the</text><text start="1064.64" dur="5.19">other and a cross-section from a</text><text start="1067.91" dur="6.35">two-dimensional perspective like is the</text><text start="1069.83" dur="7.07">cylinder a rectangle a circle well</text><text start="1074.26" dur="4.59">it&apos;s obviously whichever one is</text><text start="1076.9" dur="3.57">happening like it being a circle is true</text><text start="1078.85" dur="3.84">it&apos;s very clear that from a</text><text start="1080.47" dur="5.1">two-dimensional perspective like that is</text><text start="1082.69" dur="5.64">what is being seen it&apos;s true if there&apos;s</text><text start="1085.57" dur="4.08">the perfect fidelity to it right from</text><text start="1088.33" dur="3.74">the other direction as a rectangle it&apos;s</text><text start="1089.65" dur="4.56">also perfectly true and those two</text><text start="1092.07" dur="5.23">descriptions of reality in two</text><text start="1094.21" dur="5.42">dimensions cannot commensurate right</text><text start="1097.3" dur="4.71">they are disparate mutually exclusive</text><text start="1099.63" dur="5.41">descriptions of circles is totally round</text><text start="1102.01" dur="5.34">thing rectangles these corners and so</text><text start="1105.04" dur="3.93">then what are the opportunities well you</text><text start="1107.35" dur="3.12">can either just say I saw a circle so I</text><text start="1108.97" dur="3.63">know it&apos;s circle and the other side is</text><text start="1110.47" dur="4.26">just wrong mm-hmm that&apos;s fundamentalism</text><text start="1112.6" dur="3.84">which is kind of like there&apos;s some truth</text><text start="1114.73" dur="2.87">and I&apos;m sticking to it right and I&apos;ll</text><text start="1116.44" dur="3.84">fight with the people on the other side</text><text start="1117.6" dur="4.0">or you see the circle and then you for</text><text start="1120.28" dur="2.64">some how you happen to be on the other</text><text start="1121.6" dur="2.79">plane and see the rectangle too and you</text><text start="1122.92" dur="5.1">go shit there&apos;s seemingly truth to both</text><text start="1124.39" dur="5.79">of these now I have embraced paradox</text><text start="1128.02" dur="4.2">what do I do with this and you have</text><text start="1130.18" dur="3.84">different options one way as you say</text><text start="1132.22" dur="3.24">well maybe there&apos;s a middle path but</text><text start="1134.02" dur="2.76">you&apos;re still trying to reconcile in two</text><text start="1135.46" dur="2.55">dimensions cuz you&apos;re two dimensional</text><text start="1136.78" dur="3.48">creature so you say well what&apos;s kind of</text><text start="1138.01" dur="3.36">in the middle of a circle and a</text><text start="1140.26" dur="2.76">rectangle and you get a rounded</text><text start="1141.37" dur="2.82">rectangle now you kind of round the</text><text start="1143.02" dur="2.88">corners of the rectangle make it a</text><text start="1144.19" dur="4.17">little more circular like now that isn&apos;t</text><text start="1145.9" dur="4.53">even partially true right like that</text><text start="1148.36" dur="3.87">isn&apos;t even a little bit of any part of a</text><text start="1150.43" dur="5.43">cylinder or you just say well they&apos;re</text><text start="1152.23" dur="5.55">both true and neither are true and we</text><text start="1155.86" dur="4.05">embrace paradox and that just means you</text><text start="1157.78" dur="4.41">gave up on understanding its really what</text><text start="1159.91" dur="5.18">it means the truth is a cylinder is a</text><text start="1162.19" dur="7.13">very straight forward thing which is a</text><text start="1165.09" dur="6.52">circle translated over the space of a</text><text start="1169.32" dur="4.18">rectangle or a rectangle rotated to the</text><text start="1171.61" dur="3.15">space of a circle but you can&apos;t</text><text start="1173.5" dur="2.91">understand it in duty you can only</text><text start="1174.76" dur="3.99">understand it in 3d which means you need</text><text start="1176.41" dur="3.78">an entirely higher dimensional framework</text><text start="1178.75" dur="2.7">of understanding to get the nature of</text><text start="1180.19" dur="5.82">reality when you&apos;re trying to reduce</text><text start="1181.45" dur="6.51">reality to a dimensionally smaller</text><text start="1186.01" dur="3.99">perspective you&apos;re fucked right because</text><text start="1187.96" dur="3.57">that dimension simply can&apos;t understand</text><text start="1190.0" dur="4.14">it so then you have false paradox</text><text start="1191.53" dur="4.8">because the the perspective the view</text><text start="1194.14" dur="3.75">itself is reducing the total reality and</text><text start="1196.33" dur="3.06">you can even see just looking at the</text><text start="1197.89" dur="2.7">east side of a building versus the west</text><text start="1199.39" dur="2.4">side you could argue over what the</text><text start="1200.59" dur="4.11">building looks like and it&apos;s because</text><text start="1201.79" dur="4.47">perception is inherently reductive you</text><text start="1204.7" dur="3.06">cannot see the whole of what something</text><text start="1206.26" dur="3.87">is because there&apos;s</text><text start="1207.76" dur="4.01">many many different views of it right so</text><text start="1210.13" dur="4.91">you need a trans perspectival</text><text start="1211.77" dur="8.37">understanding that can reconcile them so</text><text start="1215.04" dur="8.11">the the reality of the cylinder is</text><text start="1220.14" dur="4.6">different than circle or rectangle but</text><text start="1223.15" dur="4.14">both of those are partially true from</text><text start="1224.74" dur="5.37">that kind of perspective well when we</text><text start="1227.29" dur="5.75">come to many existential questions it</text><text

and they the key thing to</text><text start="1278.86" dur="3.81">get and we can see all the other</text><text start="1280.63" dur="5.58">dichotomies that come with this based on</text><text

I want to</text><text start="1322.87" dur="7.65">see the progress and and see the</text><text start="1326.8" dur="5.91">evolution and then I it&apos;s almost as if I</text><text start="1330.52" dur="6.81">get caught up and pushing the ball</text><text start="1332.71" dur="8.33">forward and then I feel as though my</text><text start="1337.33" dur="5.93">state of being there&apos;s

dur="3.86">nature of reality and meaning and</text><text start="1411.14" dur="4.36">spirituality obviously it&apos;s</text><text start="1414.09" dur="2.67">oversimplified because there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="1415.5" dur="2.79">Eastern models and a lot of Western</text><text start="1416.76" dur="2.94">models and the delineation between them</text><text start="1418.29" dur="4.26">isn&apos;t clear at all but let&apos;s just take</text><text start="1419.7" dur="5.52">by Eastern I mean they kind of Vedantic</text><text start="1422.55" dur="5.34">Buddhists the primary interpretations</text><text start="1425.22" dur="4.83">which are very being focused and we&apos;re</text><text start="1427.89" dur="6.45">using these as a reference for for this</text><text start="1430.05" dur="6.21">particular dichotomy here so you notice</text><text start="1434.34" dur="3.96">in most interpretations the Buddhist</text><text start="1436.26" dur="4.41">tradition the focus is exclusively on</text><text start="1438.3" dur="7.26">being right not doing not becoming in</text><text start="1440.67" dur="6.63">fact any chop wood carry water doing is</text><text start="1445.56" dur="3.09">just because if that needs done do it</text><text start="1447.3" dur="2.91">but it&apos;s all about the quality of being</text><text start="1448.65" dur="3.8">while doing it it&apos;s the only thing that</text><text start="1450.21" dur="2.24">matters</text><text start="1454.11" dur="5.07">the reason why or one of the reasons why</text><text start="1456.51" dur="5.58">that becomes insightful is the Buddhists</text><text start="1459.18" dur="4.98">and the Hindu vedanta model of time is a</text><text start="1462.09" dur="3.36">circular model of time all right they</text><text start="1464.16" dur="5.13">have this system of time called the</text><text start="1465.45" dur="6.21">culpas or the egos where where the time</text><text start="1469.29" dur="4.5">and universe itself is believed to cycle</text><text start="1471.66" dur="4.14">cycle through birth and death so you</text><text start="1473.79" dur="4.53">know if you if you think about it these</text><text start="1475.8" dur="6.44">people watch nature very deeply and they</text><text start="1478.32" dur="7.14">saw seasons spring and fall and they saw</text><text start="1482.24" dur="4.9">empires rise and then fall they saw</text><text start="1485.46" dur="3.18">people born and then die they saw</text><text start="1487.14" dur="2.82">relationships come together and come</text><text start="1488.64" dur="3.0">apart and they just saw everything</text><text start="1489.96" dur="3.78">cycling they watched the precession of</text><text start="1491.64" dur="4.83">the equinoxes they saw cycles within</text><text start="1493.74" dur="5.91">cycles days within months within years</text><text start="1496.47" dur="5.76">within Galactic cycles right so they saw</text><text start="1499.65" dur="4.47">it was all cycles and so because of that</text><text start="1502.23" dur="4.26">if everything cycling and then then they</text><text start="1504.12" dur="4.59">extend that up to but this is just a</text><text start="1506.49" dur="4.8">intellectual extension everything in</text><text start="1508.71" dur="4.89">universe is just cycles then nothing is</text><text start="1511.29" dur="4.35">actually going anywhere we&apos;re just going</text><text start="1513.6" dur="3.93">in circles there is no actual thing</text><text start="1515.64" dur="3.66">called progress it&apos;s just the wheel of</text><text start="1517.53" dur="4.98">time right so they have this concept of</text><text start="1519.3" dur="4.65">the wheel of time so so if you&apos;re trying</text><text start="1522.51" dur="3.48">to push something forward you&apos;re just</text><text start="1523.95" dur="3.45">moving to the cycle more quickly you&apos;ve</text><text start="1525.99" dur="2.55">bought into the illusion that you&apos;re</text><text start="1527.4" dur="3.84">going anywhere right</text><text start="1528.54" dur="4.71">that spring means anything other than</text><text start="1531.24" dur="4.71">its way towards fallen death right</text><text start="1533.25" dur="5.13">mm-hmm and so this is why then they talk</text><text start="1535.95" dur="4.56">they talk about it as Maya right</text><text start="1538.38" dur="4.5">illusion or even more some sort of</text><text start="1540.51" dur="6.06">suffering so then if it&apos;s just this</text><text start="1542.88" dur="5.82">fucking loser e wheel it isn&apos;t actually</text><text start="1546.57" dur="4.23">going anywhere going further is</text><text start="1548.7" dur="3.36">meaningless so then there&apos;s actually a</text><text start="1550.8" dur="4.94">movie samsara</text><text start="1552.06" dur="4.92">on Netflix you can watch which is just</text><text start="1555.74" dur="3.61">yeah</text><text start="1556.98" dur="5.82">it&apos;s demonstrating that if you want to</text><text start="1559.35" dur="6.99">go see it that concept to concept right</text><text start="1562.8" dur="6.69">and so then the goal there becomes</text><text start="1566.34" dur="4.95">getting off the wheel and so that means</text><text start="1569.49" dur="4.05">getting out of time in the concept of</text><text start="1571.29" dur="5.43">linear time completely so then the goal</text><text start="1573.54" dur="7.08">is being able to access the eternal</text><text start="1576.72" dur="6.69">through the now and so the idea of</text><text start="1580.62" dur="4.94">becoming or of progress or making the</text><text start="1583.41" dur="4.5">world better when the whole thing is</text><text start="1585.56" dur="4.93">illusory to begin with meaning</text><text start="1587.91" dur="3.87">fundamentally to begin with just means</text><text start="1590.49" dur="3.21">you bought into the illusion you don&apos;t</text><text start="1591.78" dur="7.62">get the ultimate truth so the goal there</text><text start="1593.7" dur="7.71">is is to step out of time to be now full</text><text start="1599.4" dur="4.38">complete in a way that doesn&apos;t have</text><text start="1601.41" dur="5.61">progress built in at all mm-hmm right</text><text start="1603.78" dur="6.48">and that&apos;s the kind of pure zenith of a</text><text start="1607.02" dur="6.3">being model you notice that happiness in</text><text start="1610.26" dur="5.49">that model is a model of happiness it&apos;s</text><text start="1613.32" dur="4.38">like contentment or serenity like</text><text start="1615.75" dur="4.29">fullness right now with what is right</text><text start="1617.7" dur="4.26">and in fact anything like passion or</text><text start="1620.04" dur="3.93">desire or excitement is called the cause</text><text start="1621.96" dur="3.54">of all suffering right because that</text><text start="1623.97" dur="3.33">means that you believe something good is</text><text start="1625.5" dur="3.45">in the future so you sacrifice being in</text><text start="1627.3" dur="3.6">the moment for wanting something in the</text><text start="1628.95" dur="3.54">future and that just leads you to</text><text start="1630.9" dur="2.58">getting all feverish and fucked up and</text><text start="1632.49" dur="2.22">then when you get it you weren&apos;t even</text><text start="1633.48" dur="3.09">that happy and you want something else</text><text start="1634.71" dur="3.39">and then you&apos;re anxious of losing it so</text><text start="1636.57" dur="3.3">just don&apos;t desire anything don&apos;t have</text><text start="1638.1" dur="6.18">passion or anything just be full and</text><text start="1639.87" dur="6.06">content now all right this is also yeah</text><text start="1644.28" dur="4.47">this is great because this is also</text><text start="1645.93" dur="5.43">something I&apos;ve been I&apos;ve been studying</text><text start="1648.75" dur="7.11">you know like how do I be and then how</text><text start="1651.36" dur="8.78">do I and then also it&apos;s hard to not</text><text start="1655.86" dur="8.51">believe that my passion and my my drive</text><text start="1660.14" dur="7.3">in my just my desires are for nothing</text><text start="1664.37" dur="5.17">well they in that model they are for</text><text start="1667.44" dur="5.21">nothing that isn&apos;t a losery and stupid</text><text start="1669.54" dur="5.55">right right they they are for plenty of</text><text start="1672.65" dur="6.07">sound and fury leading to suffering and</text><text start="1675.09" dur="7.53">nothing and so that&apos;s that model but</text><text start="1678.72" dur="5.76">that is circle right that it&apos;s kind of</text><text start="1682.62" dur="4.38">true but it&apos;s so far from true that it&apos;s</text><text start="1684.48" dur="3.6">just actually infinitely off okay I&apos;m so</text><text start="1687.0" dur="3.18">far from the whole truth it&apos;s a</text><text start="1688.08" dur="3.78">dimensional reduction so then let&apos;s look</text><text start="1690.18" dur="4.86">at the Western model so everyone think</text><text start="1691.86" dur="5.22">it sounds boring it can sound boring but</text><text start="1695.04" dur="5.49">of course then the idea of boring in</text><text start="1697.08" dur="5.04">that model would be a mental trap and</text><text start="1700.53" dur="4.44">that when you come into the fullness of</text><text start="1702.12" dur="7.02">being right now you can access and this</text><text start="1704.97" dur="6.84">is true a state of serenity that has a</text><text start="1709.14" dur="4.56">kind of blissfulness to it it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="1711.81" dur="5.25">need you to do anything and that is</text><text start="1713.7" dur="5.64">unperturbed well so be like no you</text><text start="1717.06" dur="4.6">actually don&apos;t get what the fullness of</text><text start="1719.34" dur="4.09">being and you drop into it is</text><text start="1721.66" dur="3.84">right that is eternal and that&apos;s unfuck</text><text start="1723.43" dur="5.09">with Abel so that&apos;s that</text><text start="1725.5" dur="6.36">now the Western model of time kind of</text><text start="1728.52" dur="6.37">originating Judaism we can say and then</text><text start="1731.86" dur="6.17">the Greeks and modern science and you</text><text start="1734.89" dur="6.45">know I&apos;ve told most of the world now</text><text start="1738.03" dur="7.9">because early Jews were very focused on</text><text start="1741.34" dur="7.32">history and noticing their kind of</text><text start="1745.93" dur="5.97">progression as a as a people new</text><text start="1748.66" dur="6.03">technology as it emerged and new law and</text><text start="1751.9" dur="4.29">new ideas and etc they and they were</text><text start="1754.69" dur="4.59">recording that they were actually</text><text start="1756.19" dur="4.68">noticing net change over time and that</text><text start="1759.28" dur="4.23">new things were emerging that didn&apos;t</text><text start="1760.87" dur="4.92">exist before and so rather than focusing</text><text start="1763.51" dur="3.66">on the cycles and in nature and seeing</text><text start="1765.79" dur="3.54">everything as cyclic they were focused</text><text start="1767.17" dur="4.47">on the emergence of things humans were</text><text start="1769.33" dur="3.75">creating that were additive and actually</text><text start="1771.64" dur="4.08">going somewhere and so they had a linear</text><text start="1773.08" dur="5.7">model of time so time was actually going</text><text start="1775.72" dur="3.96">somewhere and so that led to a dialectic</text><text start="1778.78" dur="3.21">of progress</text><text start="1779.68" dur="5.39">and a focus on becoming more than being</text><text start="1781.99" dur="6.33">then that in that model there is their</text><text start="1785.07" dur="6.61">what I&apos;ve seen is there&apos;s a beginning</text><text start="1788.32" dur="5.13">and an end maybe or maybe not sometimes</text><text start="1791.68" dur="6.99">there is a beginning and an end and</text><text start="1793.45" dur="7.44">maybe the beginning is the beginning of</text><text start="1798.67" dur="4.92">universe in genesis maybe the beginning</text><text start="1800.89" dur="3.96">is when you were born maybe the end is</text><text start="1803.59" dur="4.95">heaven right there&apos;s different kind of</text><text start="1804.85" dur="5.37">theological x&apos; they can disagree about</text><text start="1808.54" dur="3.48">where the beginning and the end is they</text><text start="1810.22" dur="3.72">can even have a reincarnation model</text><text start="1812.02" dur="3.63">within it but that there isn&apos;t that</text><text start="1813.94" dur="3.15">progress along the whole thing right</text><text start="1815.65" dur="2.94">because universe itself is actually</text><text start="1817.09" dur="3.09">going somewhere and so you&apos;re going</text><text start="1818.59" dur="5.16">somewhere within it and you&apos;re adding to</text><text start="1820.18" dur="5.73">universe going somewhere well if you&apos;re</text><text start="1823.75" dur="5.13">if you think universe is actually going</text><text start="1825.91" dur="4.86">somewhere then adding to universe going</text><text start="1828.88" dur="4.44">somewhere is inherently meaningful and</text><text start="1830.77" dur="4.83">you being part of where it&apos;s going is</text><text start="1833.32" dur="5.04">inherently meaningful so then just being</text><text start="1835.6" dur="5.7">in the moment is not that interesting</text><text start="1838.36" dur="4.92">becoming evermore in a universe that is</text><text start="1841.3" dur="4.83">itself becoming evermore so developing</text><text start="1843.28" dur="5.13">oneself right in which case being just</text><text start="1846.13" dur="4.32">completely content in a way that has no</text><text start="1848.41" dur="3.99">Drive is is antithetical to what&apos;s</text><text start="1850.45" dur="4.33">purposeful so you notice their</text><text start="1852.4" dur="4.93">definition of happiness has a lot more</text><text start="1854.78" dur="5.88">it sounds like passion and excitement</text><text start="1857.33" dur="5.1">right right and which way you were to</text><text start="1860.66" dur="4.53">look at if you look at those cultures</text><text start="1862.43" dur="5.94">there&apos;s a lot of singing dancing you</text><text start="1865.19" dur="5.49">know even partying whereas you look at</text><text start="1868.37" dur="8.19">some of the more Eastern philosophies</text><text start="1870.68" dur="8.19">and it&apos;s things very quiet and and it&apos;s</text><text start="1876.56" dur="4.59">the traditions are that I that I that</text><text start="1878.87" dur="6.12">I&apos;m that I&apos;m imagining right now like a</text><text start="1881.15" dur="6.78">tea ceremony yeah very just it&apos;s very</text><text start="1884.99" dur="7.74">calm not a lot of excitement very bland</text><text start="1887.93" dur="7.56">or vanilla well you&apos;re giving a Western</text><text start="1892.73" dur="5.16">bias here so you&apos;re calling it boring</text><text start="1895.49" dur="7.5">and bland and vanilla sure they would</text><text start="1897.89" dur="6.66">say profoundly serene I&apos;m am i insulting</text><text start="1902.99" dur="4.61">people that come from that perspective</text><text start="1904.55" dur="5.01">you think well probably but what&apos;s more</text><text start="1907.6" dur="3.46">what&apos;s more interesting is that you&apos;re</text><text start="1909.56" dur="2.79">not getting it yet right because you</text><text start="1911.06" dur="2.16">haven&apos;t you haven&apos;t dropped into that</text><text start="1912.35" dur="2.46">place of getting it but you probably</text><text start="1913.22" dur="2.88">have if you think about it you might</text><text start="1914.81" dur="4.38">have had moments where you&apos;re surfing</text><text start="1916.1" dur="5.19">and you stopped and everything kind of</text><text start="1919.19" dur="4.53">stops and you just see sparkles on the</text><text start="1921.29" dur="5.1">water and thinking about what&apos;s coming</text><text start="1923.72" dur="7.64">next stops and the moments full mm-hmm</text><text start="1926.39" dur="8.25">and it&apos;s more full in a certain quality</text><text start="1931.36" dur="4.39">than excitement about the future is yeah</text><text start="1934.64" dur="4.62">there&apos;s no doubt about that I&apos;ve</text><text start="1935.75" dur="6.78">definitely had moments right staying</text><text start="1939.26" dur="6.45">there so the whole eastern process would</text><text start="1942.53" dur="6.05">be staying there right each moment being</text><text start="1945.71" dur="5.6">fully with that need the endless wave</text><text start="1948.58" dur="5.14">except it doesn&apos;t it&apos;s about it</text><text start="1951.31" dur="4.96">independent of circumstance right it&apos;s</text><text start="1953.72" dur="4.47">some you&apos;re in the eye of the storm no</text><text start="1956.27" dur="5.22">matter what&apos;s happening around you you</text><text start="1958.19" dur="5.55">keep your peace yeah a part of the</text><text start="1961.49" dur="5.13">enlightenment and that model is being</text><text start="1963.74" dur="4.83">able to be fully with what is no matter</text><text start="1966.62" dur="3.54">what is no matter what is happening</text><text start="1968.57" dur="3.9">because everything that&apos;s happening is</text><text start="1970.16" dur="4.53">in illusion right it&apos;s all just changing</text><text start="1972.47" dur="5.07">and flexing but the consciousness that&apos;s</text><text start="1974.69" dur="4.8">witnessing it is ever-present and</text><text start="1977.54" dur="3.48">identifying as that and that that is</text><text start="1979.49" dur="2.64">actually the fullness right that the</text><text start="1981.02" dur="2.18">light is actually the light of</text><text start="1982.13" dur="7.49">consciousness</text><text start="1983.2" dur="8.88">that&apos;s what waking up means there now so</text><text start="1989.62" dur="4.08">if one wanted to bias from that</text><text start="1992.08" dur="3.03">direction they could look at the other</text><text start="1993.7" dur="4.38">thing with all the singing advancing and</text><text start="1995.11" dur="6.36">say look how feverish it is hmm look at</text><text start="1998.08" dur="5.01">how kind of immature and it&apos;s excitement</text><text start="2001.47" dur="3.21">when things go well and disappointment</text><text start="2003.09" dur="2.94">things don&apos;t go well look at how little</text><text start="2004.68" dur="2.64">sovereignty that people have where</text><text start="2006.03" dur="2.94">they&apos;re so affected by their environment</text><text start="2007.32" dur="3.36">and their circumstance look at how they</text><text start="2008.97" dur="3.06">rush around trying to change their</text><text start="2010.68" dur="2.79">circumstance to make themselves happy</text><text start="2012.03" dur="2.94">look at how attached they get to other</text><text start="2013.47" dur="2.82">people and how fucked up they get when</text><text start="2014.97" dur="4.29">things don&apos;t go the way they want look</text><text start="2016.29" dur="4.47">at how unhappy they are when they lose</text><text start="2019.26" dur="3.12">something look at how when they get what</text><text start="2020.76" dur="2.64">they want they&apos;re only happy for like 15</text><text start="2022.38" dur="3.54">minutes and then they want something</text><text start="2023.4" dur="6.03">else and that there&apos;s like almost</text><text start="2025.92" dur="6.96">nothing of seeming enduring depth there</text><text start="2029.43" dur="5.1">right now these are both true right so</text><text start="2032.88" dur="4.26">we&apos;re talking about circles and</text><text start="2034.53" dur="6.99">rectangles so to just finish a little</text><text start="2037.14" dur="6.36">bit on the on the Western model so time</text><text start="2041.52" dur="3.9">is going somewhere dialectic of progress</text><text start="2043.5" dur="3.96">so the focus becomes purpose because</text><text start="2045.42" dur="6.81">purpose is a time bound concept purpose</text><text start="2047.46" dur="8.61">unfolds in time right and evolution is a</text><text start="2052.23" dur="5.76">time bound concept and so evolving</text><text start="2056.07" dur="3.75">ourselves evolving

it&apos;s</text><text start="2121.78" dur="11.69">also ever every moment right and so</text><text start="2127.8" dur="8.44">there it&apos;s more about excitement passion</text><text start="2133.47" dur="4.57">you know associated with becoming now</text><text start="2136.24" dur="4.14">what&apos;s interesting when you put these</text><text start="2138.04" dur="4.77">together you have a circular model of</text><text start="2140.38" dur="4.05">time and a linear model corresponding</text><text start="2142.81" dur="5.7">with the circular is being with the</text><text start="2144.43" dur="7.2">linear is becoming with the circular as</text><text start="2148.51" dur="5.82">presence with the Lanier&apos;s purpose with</text><text start="2151.63" dur="5.13">the circular is contentment

dur="5.91">promise of possibility you notice that</text><text start="2162.19" dur="5.04">the circular model maps to the serotonin</text><text start="2165.37" dur="6.48">like happiness and the serotonergic</text><text start="2167.23" dur="6.93">systems right and the linear model maps</text><text start="2171.85" dur="6.63">to dopamine right and the dopamine kinds</text><text start="2174.16" dur="7.89">of happiness like processing and that</text><text start="2178.48" dur="6.99">the practices are tying this to the</text><text start="2182.05" dur="5.52">there are transmitters this brings so</text><text start="2185.47" dur="3.71">much application and if anyone knows</text><text start="2187.57" dur="4.47">anything about how those things are</text><text start="2189.18" dur="5.83">impact or if you&apos;ve had experiences</text><text start="2192.04" dur="6.84">where you had an excess and dopamine or</text><text start="2195.01" dur="5.97">serotonin right and it&apos;s like oh that&apos;s</text><text start="2198.88" dur="4.11">why those experiences were it that way</text><text start="2200.98" dur="4.2">people have interesting people who&apos;ve</text><text start="2202.99" dur="5.22">explored it might resonate with thee</text><text start="2205.18" dur="5.94">they took a serotonin urja faint right</text><text start="2208.21" dur="5.43">they took MDMA and they became very in</text><text start="2211.12" dur="4.35">the moment very sensory very feeling</text><text start="2213.64" dur="4.08">very in the fullness of everything being</text><text start="2215.47" dur="4.38">overwhelmingly beautiful now yeah almost</text><text start="2217.72" dur="4.29">no awareness of other than now okay</text><text start="2219.85" dur="4.26">someone took dopaminergic thing right</text><text start="2222.01" dur="4.74">they took adderall or cocaine or</text><text start="2224.11" dur="5.04">whatever they become profoundly focused</text><text start="2226.75" dur="3.93">on what they wanted to create and they</text><text start="2229.15" dur="5.52">all they wanted to do is be in the</text><text start="2230.68" dur="6.3">process of creating it right and we can</text><text start="2234.67" dur="5.04">see the beauty and the crashes of both</text><text start="2236.98" dur="5.28">of those and what becomes more available</text><text start="2239.71" dur="4.23">and less available in both of those we</text><text start="2242.26" dur="3.87">can see them the practices right a lot</text><text start="2243.94" dur="4.38">of the eastern practices are serotonin</text><text start="2246.13" dur="4.38">Erick practices being in the moment</text><text start="2248.32" dur="5.1">breathing slow being</text><text start="2250.51" dur="5.67">nature having all of your awareness your</text><text start="2253.42" dur="6.32">sensory awareness and what is a lot of</text><text start="2256.18" dur="6.15">the Western practices are create goals</text><text start="2259.74" dur="4.33">achieve the goals feel good that you</text><text start="2262.33" dur="3.66">achieved them check them off reinforce</text><text start="2264.07" dur="6.06">having goals create more goals check ray</text><text start="2265.99" dur="6.96">and those are dopaminergic practices now</text><text start="2270.13" dur="6.33">if we come back to our 2d 3d technology</text><text start="2272.95" dur="5.85">I mean dopamine is addiction yeah right</text><text start="2276.46" dur="4.05">dopamine dopamine and its relationship</text><text start="2278.8" dur="3.5">with opioids the dopamine opioid system</text><text start="2280.51" dur="4.71">is feels good do it again</text><text start="2282.3" dur="5.32">because it is time-bound what things</text><text start="2285.22" dur="3.27">were evolutionarily relevant to do again</text><text start="2287.62" dur="3.48">right</text><text start="2288.49" dur="4.23">nobody said in terms of addicted to</text><text start="2291.1" dur="2.73">serotonin if you&apos;re having an experience</text><text start="2292.72" dur="2.93">that is more about being in the moment</text><text start="2293.83" dur="6.03">you&apos;re not jonesing for the next moment</text><text start="2295.65" dur="6.97">right that would explain why people tend</text><text start="2299.86" dur="8.67">to get hooked on something like cocaine</text><text start="2302.62" dur="7.38">and maybe MDMA is not as addictive right</text><text start="2308.53" dur="3.18">now someone might have a serotonin</text><text start="2310.0" dur="3.54">imbalance so they&apos;re gonna keep wanting</text><text start="2311.71" dur="3.99">to go back to some serotonin magic thing</text><text start="2313.54" dur="6.36">does all you see all SSRIs are focused</text><text start="2315.7" dur="6.84">on that but it is all addiction relates</text><text start="2319.9" dur="4.74">to the dopamine axis hmm other things</text><text start="2322.54" dur="10.35">are involved but it will always involve</text><text start="2324.64" dur="10.11">that okay now come back to our 3d 2d</text><text start="2332.89" dur="4.26">analogy with the cylinder but let&apos;s look</text><text start="2334.75" dur="4.62">at their models of time here and the</text><text start="2337.15" dur="4.2">circle and the the circular model of</text><text start="2339.37" dur="4.2">time linear model of time and if we</text><text start="2341.35" dur="3.12">embed those on each other in a higher</text><text start="2343.57" dur="2.67">dimension because those are both</text><text start="2344.47" dur="3.33">one-dimensional right one dimension</text><text start="2346.24" dur="4.14">curved back on itself like a circle or</text><text start="2347.8" dur="4.56">one dimension you know if time that just</text><text start="2350.38" dur="4.2">continues straight if you bring them</text><text start="2352.36" dur="3.78">together you get a spiral of time right</text><text start="2354.58" dur="3.48">which is a circle that isn&apos;t closing on</text><text start="2356.14" dur="4.26">itself it&apos;s a circle that is actually</text><text start="2358.06" dur="5.12">moving along a line so then you say are</text><text start="2360.4" dur="5.73">there cycles yes there are cycles and</text><text start="2363.18" dur="6.34">there is net change from one cycle to</text><text start="2366.13" dur="5.94">the next now why this is meaningful as</text><text start="2369.52" dur="4.2">we see we look at the ecosystem and we</text><text start="2372.07" dur="2.91">see that you&apos;ve got spring and fall and</text><text start="2373.72" dur="4.2">spring and fall and things are born and</text><text start="2374.98" dur="4.11">die but over the course of deep time you</text><text start="2377.92" dur="2.79">look at the fossil record there&apos;s</text><text start="2379.09" dur="2.79">evolution of new organisms that weren&apos;t</text><text start="2380.71" dur="4.47">there before</text><text start="2381.88" dur="4.89">so there is net change over time while</text><text start="2385.18" dur="2.91">there are cycles and how that occurs</text><text start="2386.77" dur="2.94">it&apos;s important to understand that there</text><text start="2388.09" dur="5.7">are cycles because that means that in</text><text start="2389.71" dur="7.2">how you proceed in becoming you need to</text><text start="2393.79" dur="5.88">have phases of activity and phases of</text><text start="2396.91" dur="5.34">rest phases of going outward and phases</text><text start="2399.67" dur="4.32">of coming inward phases of learning new</text><text start="2402.25" dur="3.12">things and then phases of applying that</text><text start="2403.99" dur="3.57">learning phase of learning new things</text><text start="2405.37" dur="4.62">phases of digesting and you know taking</text><text start="2407.56" dur="5.25">taking that to process with everything</text><text start="2409.99" dur="4.59">else you know if you don&apos;t understand it</text><text start="2412.81" dur="5.04">there are cycles every time it&apos;s time to</text><text start="2414.58" dur="5.04">come inward or to digest or to learn</text><text start="2417.85" dur="5.07">something new or to step back you&apos;ll</text><text start="2419.62" dur="6.06">feel like you&apos;re not making progress but</text><text start="2422.92" dur="5.36">the key is that those like this or</text><text start="2425.68" dur="5.01">you&apos;ll never want to sleep right mm-hmm</text><text start="2428.28" dur="5.37">I&apos;ve gone through phases where I&apos;m</text><text start="2430.69" dur="7.13">pushing pushing pushing and then crash</text><text start="2433.65" dur="7.06">and it looked you know in hearing this I</text><text start="2437.82" dur="5.71">could have been more sensitive to the</text><text start="2440.71" dur="4.5">fact that it has to cycle in that way so</text><text start="2443.53" dur="3.78">you don&apos;t have to push and then crash</text><text start="2445.21" dur="3.99">where the cycle forces itself on you you</text><text start="2447.31" dur="6.6">can go with it and you actually you</text><text start="2449.2" dur="6.72">optimize yourself over time hmm now at</text><text start="2453.91" dur="4.2">the same time you realize that within</text><text start="2455.92" dur="3.78">that cycle net growth is happening so</text><text start="2458.11" dur="3.63">you might come back to it&apos;s interesting</text><text start="2459.7" dur="4.32">how I can see this in some aspects of my</text><text start="2461.74" dur="4.44">life but then I completely neglect them</text><text start="2464.02" dur="3.6">and others right right</text><text start="2466.18" dur="3.27">well now the area&apos;s you&apos;ve neglected</text><text start="2467.62" dur="4.77">them and you can start looking at and</text><text start="2469.45" dur="4.92">saying where am i pushing where it is</text><text start="2472.39" dur="4.38">inexorable that there is a cycle that if</text><text start="2474.37" dur="4.53">I give space to it I&apos;ll actually get go</text><text start="2476.77" dur="3.84">further faster and I&apos;ll enjoy the</text><text start="2478.9" dur="5.34">process more my being and my becoming</text><text start="2480.61" dur="5.67">well both of all yeah so now we put this</text><text start="2484.24" dur="3.78">together right and if we have a model of</text><text start="2486.28" dur="7.1">time in which cycles happen but net</text><text start="2488.02" dur="6.66">growth also happens then and we start to</text><text start="2493.38" dur="3.34">simple</text><text start="2494.68" dur="4.82">to reconcile all the elements of both of</text><text start="2496.72" dur="5.91">those do we want to be unconditionally</text><text start="2499.5" dur="6.09">able to access fullness and contentment</text><text start="2502.63" dur="5.22">now yes do we want to be able to access</text><text start="2505.59" dur="4.72">creative desire and passion about the</text><text start="2507.85" dur="6.59">future yes do we want to be excited</text><text start="2510.31" dur="6.9">about making something happen and not</text><text start="2514.44" dur="7.26">devastated if it doesn&apos;t happen yes both</text><text start="2517.21" dur="4.49">at the same time right do we want to be</text><text start="2523.74" dur="4.48">optimizing our dopamine or Jick circuits</text><text start="2526.03" dur="3.6">or our serotonergic circuits yes both</text><text start="2528.22" dur="2.94">right the fullness of the human</text><text start="2529.63" dur="4.53">experience and so we can see how</text><text start="2531.16" dur="5.67">different cultures were or pioneering</text><text start="2534.16" dur="5.04">the insights that now we can synthesize</text><text start="2536.83" dur="4.14">right they were pioneering how to really</text><text start="2539.2" dur="4.92">bring those insights and practices about</text><text start="2540.97" dur="5.22">where now as a global people that can</text><text start="2544.12" dur="3.18">harvest the wisdom from all these</text><text start="2546.19" dur="3.18">cultures right here together we can</text><text start="2547.3" dur="3.84">really start to synthesize how do we be</text><text start="2549.37" dur="5.58">in the moment fully and be becoming</text><text start="2551.14" dur="5.28">fully and so the fullness of the human</text><text start="2554.95" dur="5.61">experience is both and if we look at it</text><text start="2556.42" dur="5.7">like this so here&apos;s someone and I want</text><text start="2560.56" dur="3.36">to love them unconditionally the way</text><text start="2562.12" dur="4.59">they are right now I also want to help</text><text start="2563.92" dur="6.3">them grow which one do I do to go back</text><text start="2566.71" dur="5.67">and forth between them when I really get</text><text start="2570.22" dur="4.53">it I realize that they&apos;re the exact same</text><text start="2572.38" dur="4.2">thing the cylinder is actually one thing</text><text start="2574.75" dur="4.8">it isn&apos;t a bunch of circles stacked up</text><text start="2576.58" dur="5.97">is one thing right yeah if I love them</text><text start="2579.55" dur="5.46">the way they are completely the way they</text><text start="2582.55" dur="4.8">are is not actually a static thing they</text><text start="2585.01" dur="3.57">are a verb right they are different than</text><text start="2587.35" dur="2.76">they were yesterday they will be</text><text start="2588.58" dur="3.69">different tomorrow there&apos;s a sameness</text><text start="2590.11" dur="4.62">but there&apos;s a becoming that is part of</text><text start="2592.27" dur="5.19">their being and because there is an</text><text start="2594.73" dur="4.83">impulse in them to express who they are</text><text start="2597.46" dur="4.02">more and more fully to self-actualize to</text><text start="2599.56" dur="3.84">self realize to add to universe to</text><text start="2601.48" dur="4.44">realize the depths of what&apos;s possible</text><text start="2603.4" dur="4.26">for them loving them for who they are is</text><text start="2605.92" dur="3.48">wanting for them is wanting for their</text><text start="2607.66" dur="4.47">fullest expression is also helping them</text><text start="2609.4" dur="4.32">become that so loving them</text><text start="2612.13" dur="2.97">unconditionally the way they are and</text><text start="2613.72" dur="3.51">supporting them to be what they&apos;re</text><text start="2615.1" dur="3.3">becoming are the same fucking thing when</text><text start="2617.23" dur="3.27">you actually get that those aren&apos;t</text><text start="2618.4" dur="5.99">dichotomous at all the built within the</text><text start="2620.5" dur="3.89">being is verb Ness</text><text start="2625.43" dur="9.81">this is this is extremely helpful and</text><text start="2629.69" dur="7.99">then I as you&apos;re talking about that some</text><text start="2635.24" dur="4.63">visualizing a couple different</text><text start="2637.68" dur="7.2">relationships I have where in the past I</text><text start="2639.87" dur="6.72">had a heart had a hard time accepting</text><text start="2644.88" dur="4.02">people where they were at</text><text start="2646.59" dur="4.47">mm-hm and then wanting more for them but</text><text start="2648.9" dur="3.84">the simple fact but I wasn&apos;t accepting</text><text start="2651.06" dur="5.9">them for where they were at in that</text><text start="2652.74" dur="7.17">moment and who they were becoming like</text><text

would that be accurate or</text><text start="2887.02" dur="7.31">do you think that&apos;s a workaround</text><text start="2889.23" dur="5.1">yeah so let me say it another way</text><text start="2898.41" dur="3.419">Rosenburg the developer of the nomadic</text><text start="2900.21" dur="5.51">communication system had a good way of</text><text start="2901.829" dur="7.201">saying this point said our fundamental</text><text start="2905.72" dur="6.97">needs and our fundamental values always</text><text start="2909.03" dur="5.25">work together sometimes our strategies</text><text

sometimes we get very</text><text start="2917.849" dur="3.99">attached to the strategies and don&apos;t</text><text start="2919.23" dur="6.53">even make a distinction right so there&apos;s</text><text start="2921.839" dur="6.811">a couple and one of them is having</text><text start="2925.76" dur="4.69">they&apos;re fighting about like you never go</text><text start="2928.65" dur="3.33">places and go to parties with me and you</text><text start="2930.45" dur="3.359">never give me fucking space and you know</text><text start="2931.98" dur="5.609">like that they&apos;re in that dialogue and</text><text start="2933.809" dur="6.54">they and one of them is really wanting</text><text start="2937.589" dur="3.901">the other person to go interact with</text><text start="2940.349" dur="2.821">their friends and the other one is</text><text start="2941.49" dur="3.66">really wanting to be about themselves</text><text start="2943.17" dur="4.619">and it seems like they are unreconciled</text><text start="2945.15" dur="4.74">things that they want and there&apos;s a</text><text start="2947.789" dur="4.731">million versions of this right but</text><text start="2949.89" dur="2.63">underneath it</text><text start="2953.97" dur="5.01">one person is usually wanting more that</text><text start="2956.94" dur="4.29">their actual need or values around</text><text start="2958.98" dur="5.369">connection when the truth is most people</text><text start="2961.23" dur="5.45">value connection and one of the and the</text><text start="2964.349" dur="5.161">other person might be valuing</text><text start="2966.68" dur="5.32">sovereignty you know or individuality</text><text start="2969.51" dur="4.95">freedom both people actually value</text><text start="2972.0" dur="4.65">freedom right and so when you get to</text><text start="2974.46" dur="3.6">what is actually the essential value</text><text start="2976.65" dur="3.15">that I have here you&apos;ll realize we</text><text start="2978.06" dur="3.24">actually share this and they&apos;re like oh</text><text start="2979.8" dur="3.569">shit I want you to have freedom I want</text><text start="2981.3" dur="3.809">to freedom to oh I want you to have</text><text start="2983.369" dur="3.571">connection I want to have that too then</text><text start="2985.109" dur="3.601">you say if we were if we stopped being</text><text start="2986.94" dur="3.51">focused on I can only have connection if</text><text start="2988.71" dur="3.149">you do this thing with me this way which</text><text start="2990.45" dur="2.43">might be something you actually hate but</text><text start="2991.859" dur="2.461">there&apos;s plenty of other things you might</text><text start="2992.88" dur="3.27">like to do that we could connect on</text><text start="2994.32" dur="5.61">that&apos;s the strategy that&apos;s the strategy</text><text start="2996.15" dur="5.28">or I can only have freedom if I don&apos;t do</text><text start="2999.93" dur="3.72">this thing and I do this other thing and</text><text start="3001.43" dur="3.63">right maybe I can have the freedom to</text><text start="3003.65" dur="3.15">choose to do that rather than feel</text><text start="3005.06" dur="4.26">forced into it knowing that I&apos;m choosing</text><text start="3006.8" dur="5.549">it right you know so if you let go of</text><text start="3009.32" dur="5.07">the strategies and you come to the needs</text><text start="3012.349" dur="3.991">you say are there ever a time where</text><text start="3014.39" dur="3.9">those needs don&apos;t work together no they</text><text start="3016.34" dur="3.87">always work together or those values</text><text start="3018.29" dur="3.75">those values always work together so</text><text start="3020.21" dur="5.37">then to the degree we can actually chill</text><text start="3022.04" dur="5.52">out on the strategies and say is there a</text><text start="3025.58" dur="3.09">strategy that meets all the needs that</text><text start="3027.56" dur="5.16">fulfills all the value simultaneously</text><text start="3028.67" dur="5.85">there always will be yeah okay and this</text><text start="3032.72" dur="3.75">is another place of like getting past a</text><text start="3034.52" dur="5.069">false dichotomy it seems like these are</text><text start="3036.47" dur="5.19">unreconciled but when you can step to a</text><text start="3039.589" dur="6.871">higher level right the level of values</text><text start="3041.66" dur="9.63">not strategy they are reconcilable with</text><text start="3046.46" dur="10.409">this with this perspective I imagine</text><text start="3051.29" dur="8.309">people are thinking now what&apos;s there&apos;s</text><text start="3056.869" dur="5.301">nothing stopping us from loving each</text><text start="3059.599" dur="2.571">other fully</text><text start="3064.18" dur="7.26">why do we prefer some people over others</text><text start="3067.0" dur="10.79">and and who we connect with mm-hmm it&apos;s</text><text start="3071.44" dur="8.879">a very deep question why do we or why</text><text start="3077.79" dur="5.11">should we continue to as we have all</text><text start="3080.319" dur="4.831">were very different oh we do</text><text start="3082.9" dur="4.29">historically for a bunch of mostly</text><text start="3085.15" dur="5.85">unconscious and not really great reasons</text><text start="3087.19" dur="7.35">right we prefer some people because</text><text start="3091.0" dur="5.22">they&apos;re the color that we&apos;re used to or</text><text start="3094.54" dur="4.44">because they&apos;re wealthy or because</text><text start="3096.22" dur="6.389">they&apos;re hot or because they&apos;re mostly</text><text start="3098.98" dur="5.79">like one that one is their right that&apos;s</text><text start="3102.609" dur="5.191">that&apos;s a where your biology program to</text><text start="3104.77" dur="5.19">you I was gonna ask about that how much</text><text start="3107.8" dur="4.62">of that is biology and how much of that</text><text start="3109.96" dur="5.909">is culture well because there&apos;s</text><text start="3112.42" dur="7.38">definitely you know our our you look at</text><text start="3115.869" dur="6.811">what a model look like fifty years ago</text><text start="3119.8" dur="4.74">even now any difference and what</text><text start="3122.68" dur="2.76">different cultures find beautiful there</text><text start="3124.54" dur="2.519">are differences there&apos;s also</text><text start="3125.44" dur="4.53">similarities the similarities our</text><text start="3127.059" dur="4.921">evolutionary biology and that relate to</text><text start="3129.97" dur="6.06">fertility right signs of fertility and</text><text start="3131.98" dur="7.099">the the differences are culture but the</text><text start="3136.03" dur="6.9">point is those are both conditioned now</text><text start="3139.079" dur="6.73">you relate with those but how many</text><text start="3142.93" dur="4.919">people are there that I could find</text><text start="3145.809" dur="3.871">really hot from an evolutionary biology</text><text start="3147.849" dur="6.591">point of view it would be absolutely</text><text start="3149.68" dur="7.46">terrible matches for me most of them</text><text start="3154.44" dur="4.29">ain&apos;t like it&apos;s not hard to go to a gym</text><text start="3157.14" dur="5.15">or go to a beach and see a bunch of guys</text><text start="3158.73" dur="6.45">or girls that are hot regularly and yet</text><text start="3162.29" dur="6.22">they you might have almost exactly</text><text start="3165.18" dur="4.86">opposite core core worldviews values</text><text start="3168.51" dur="3.18">ideals beliefs you might be very</text><text start="3170.04" dur="4.59">symbiotic with supporting each other on</text><text start="3171.69" dur="4.919">a path or not and so it&apos;s not that that</text><text start="3174.63" dur="6.26">is a completely meaningless metric but</text><text start="3176.609" dur="4.281">it it&apos;s a metric that&apos;s important to</text><text start="3183.43" dur="4.82">make sure does not override your</text><text start="3186.13" dur="4.56">assessment of all the other metrics and</text><text start="3188.25" dur="6.01">especially as you if you are thinking</text><text start="3190.69" dur="6.78">about enduring relationship if that</text><text start="3194.26" dur="6.16">metric will fade period</text><text start="3197.47" dur="5.23">it will fade because aging will change</text><text start="3200.42" dur="4.04">aesthetics and it will fade because even</text><text start="3202.7" dur="4.65">before aging changes aesthetics</text><text start="3204.46" dur="6.82">chemistry wears off as soon as it&apos;s no</text><text start="3207.35" dur="5.58">longer new and novel and if you think of</text><text start="3211.28" dur="3.57">it from an evolutionary biology point of</text><text start="3212.93" dur="4.89">view there&apos;s a lot of evolutionary</text><text start="3214.85" dur="7.26">advantage to staying together long</text><text start="3217.82" dur="6.12">enough to make sure that offspring</text><text start="3222.11" dur="3.09">happens and then there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="3223.94" dur="3.0">evolutionary advantage to have more</text><text start="3225.2" dur="4.8">offspring in more places so that some of</text><text start="3226.94" dur="6.03">them will get through right yeah and so</text><text start="3230.0" dur="6.33">that looks like serial monogamy right</text><text start="3232.97" dur="4.74">that looks like fall in love and then</text><text start="3236.33" dur="2.52">fall out of love fall in love somewhere</text><text start="3237.71" dur="3.93">else if it&apos;s not falling in love it&apos;s</text><text start="3238.85" dur="5.79">falling in biochemical procreation</text><text start="3241.64" dur="6.26">patterns and then rationalizing a lot of</text><text start="3244.64" dur="7.2">love that is all really nonsense</text><text start="3247.9" dur="7.54">just so realizing that that is going to</text><text start="3251.84" dur="5.4">fade then you say all right how control</text><text start="3255.44" dur="3.24">by that do I want to be versus how much</text><text start="3257.24" dur="3.06">do I want to create something enduring</text><text start="3258.68" dur="4.35">what is an enduring basis of</text><text start="3260.3" dur="4.2">relationship and this is going to be now</text><text start="3263.03" dur="4.23">this comes to being and becoming again</text><text start="3264.5" dur="4.62">our beings need to connect and our B</text><text start="3267.26" dur="3.51">comings need to connect if we&apos;re gonna</text><text start="3269.12" dur="3.39">have a relationship that&apos;s enduring who</text><text start="3270.77" dur="3.54">they are becoming and who I am becoming</text><text start="3272.51" dur="4.59">actually need to connect so that as time</text><text start="3274.31" dur="4.35">goes on we are on deeper and deeper</text><text start="3277.1" dur="4.29">paths so you see a lot of people it&apos;s</text><text start="3278.66" dur="3.9">like they&apos;re vectors are crossing so for</text><text start="3281.39" dur="2.85">a while they&apos;re coming closer together</text><text start="3282.56" dur="4.64">and then they cross and then they start</text><text start="3284.24" dur="5.28">going further apart and to stay together</text><text start="3287.2" dur="4.45">they actually have someone has to pull</text><text start="3289.52" dur="4.08">the other one off their path mmm or they</text><text start="3291.65" dur="3.72">go further apart there are other people</text><text start="3293.6" dur="3.45">where it&apos;s almost like two converging</text><text start="3295.37" dur="3.48">vectors right like they&apos;re</text><text start="3297.05" dur="5.79">asymptotically converging towards each</text><text start="3298.85" dur="7.98">other and this is why part of a good fit</text><text start="3302.84" dur="7.53">is is not just does our lifestyle fit do</text><text start="3306.83" dur="5.31">our way of being now fit to our</text><text start="3310.37" dur="4.29">chemistry&apos;s fit but it&apos;s actually do our</text><text start="3312.14" dur="5.93">deepest aspirations and our basis for</text><text start="3314.66" dur="5.72">choice and our visions of the future fit</text><text start="3318.07" dur="5.4">which is this is super meaningful right</text><text start="3320.38" dur="7.77">very and because this is something that</text><text start="3323.47" dur="8.04">people I imagine are exploring</text><text start="3328.15" dur="5.01">superficially mm-hmm and it might be</text><text start="3331.51" dur="3.12">superficially like do you want kids I</text><text start="3333.16" dur="4.38">want kids or you can make enough money</text><text start="3334.63" dur="5.91">yeah okay cool we can do this but as it</text><text start="3337.54" dur="5.49">goes much deeper it&apos;s one of the metrics</text><text start="3340.54" dur="5.46">of a healthy relationship is that you&apos;re</text><text start="3343.03" dur="5.37">becoming paths right as you are evolving</text><text start="3346.0" dur="4.82">you&apos;re becoming paths that you are</text><text start="3348.4" dur="2.42">evolving</text><text start="3351.48" dur="3.72">better because of being in that</text><text start="3353.369" dur="5.641">relationship then you would being out of</text><text start="3355.2" dur="5.159">it right or being in a some other one</text><text start="3359.01" dur="5.25">that was less good of a fit in that way</text><text start="3360.359" dur="6.061">and so who you you are actually being</text><text start="3364.26" dur="4.02">who you essentially are more fully</text><text start="3366.42" dur="3.48">because of their influence in your life</text><text start="3368.28" dur="3.3">this doesn&apos;t mean that you&apos;re</text><text start="3369.9" dur="3.78">codependent Lea depending on them for it</text><text start="3371.58" dur="3.48">but it means they are an enhancement to</text><text start="3373.68" dur="3.21">the degree they&apos;re influencing you of</text><text start="3375.06" dur="5.16">your own being and your own becoming and</text><text start="3376.89" dur="4.62">you are for them oftentimes will have</text><text start="3380.22" dur="3.66">relationships that are more about</text><text start="3381.51" dur="4.08">addiction than love where I&apos;m actually</text><text start="3383.88" dur="3.5">being less of who I really want to be</text><text start="3385.59" dur="3.9">and then becoming less right I&apos;m I&apos;m</text><text start="3387.38" dur="3.55">less available to my friends and</text><text start="3389.49" dur="3.54">families I&apos;m absorbed as fuck in the</text><text start="3390.93" dur="3.99">relationship

like a relationship</text><text start="3407.82" dur="5.76">to cocaine or heroin than a relationship</text><text start="3409.65" dur="5.79">to an evolutionary path right it&apos;s more</text><text

dur="3.9">direction right the eastern side of this</text><text start="3458.49" dur="4.35">is their ability to love everything more</text><text start="3460.23" dur="4.379">to get to get connection pleasure with</text><text start="3462.84" dur="3.57">everything more and as they&apos;re evolving</text><text start="3464.609" dur="3.181">they&apos;re becoming they have ability to</text><text

a</text><text start="3562.549" dur="6.091">job or we may we make a lot of choices</text><text start="3565.339" dur="5.371">and well technically every everything in</text><text start="3568.64" dur="6.3">our life is a relationship you know we</text><text start="3570.71" dur="5.879">take a job where we&apos;re we&apos;re doing a</text><text start="3574.94" dur="4.169">thing in relationship

addiction</text><text start="3589.79" dur="7.559">versus you know growth well you can</text><text start="3594.5" dur="4.829">actually notice the vector shift in the</text><text start="3597.349" dur="5.871">moment you can actually notice the</text><text start="3599.329" dur="3.891">quality of being in the moment so</text><text start="3605.06" dur="7.07">am i relating to this thing in a way</text><text start="3607.36" dur="8.02">where my presence to the rest of life is</text><text start="3612.13" dur="5.29">decreasing hmm or my presence of the</text><text start="3615.38" dur="3.69">rest of life is increasing I&apos;m doing a</text><text start="3617.42" dur="3.15">bodybuilding competition and all I can</text><text start="3619.07" dur="3.27">think about the bodybuilding competition</text><text start="3620.57" dur="4.05">and if I lose everything sucks in life</text><text start="3622.34" dur="5.4">and I actually don&apos;t really love the</text><text start="3624.62" dur="6.63">people in front of me actively and I mmm</text><text start="3627.74" dur="5.1">that might be an effective mindset to</text><text start="3631.25" dur="3.33">take to be obsessed about doing the</text><text start="3632.84" dur="4.14">bodybuilding thing but here&apos;s your</text><text start="3634.58" dur="5.28">question does doing create being will</text><text start="3636.98" dur="4.35">you actually be meaningfully happy with</text><text start="3639.86" dur="4.89">who you are at the end if you win</text><text start="3641.33" dur="5.88">no because on the becoming side right</text><text start="3644.75" dur="5.28">okay so I became buff but then that&apos;s</text><text start="3647.21" dur="5.85">just gonna it&apos;s becoming forevers so</text><text start="3650.03" dur="5.37">then it&apos;s I&apos;m not happy because it was</text><text start="3653.06" dur="4.47">only mr. world need to win mr. universe</text><text start="3655.4" dur="4.38">or whatever so then it&apos;ll lead to more</text><text start="3657.53" dur="5.64">becoming it&apos;ll never lead to being in</text><text start="3659.78" dur="5.94">that way unless the things I&apos;m working</text><text start="3663.17" dur="4.11">on becoming are related to my being</text><text start="3665.72" dur="4.41">right I&apos;m actually evolving in my</text><text start="3667.28" dur="4.83">presence my character my and so one of</text><text start="3670.13" dur="2.64">the key things is am I even evolving the</text><text start="3672.11" dur="3.18">right things</text><text start="3672.77" dur="4.61">am I even focused on the evolution of</text><text start="3675.29" dur="4.35">the right things or do I have a wrong</text><text start="3677.38" dur="4.9">causation believed I have the belief</text><text start="3679.64" dur="4.17">that this strategy is how I will then be</text><text start="3682.28" dur="4.53">happy and so I&apos;m trying to pursue</text><text start="3683.81" dur="5.07">happiness or how much money or how buff</text><text start="3686.81" dur="4.35">I get or something it is actually a</text><text start="3688.88" dur="3.63">wrong causal strategy no amount like yes</text><text start="3691.16" dur="3.87">I might get richer yes I might get</text><text start="3692.51" dur="4.17">buffer no I won&apos;t get happier that</text><text start="3695.03" dur="3.81">actually isn&apos;t related to a mechanic of</text><text start="3696.68" dur="4.95">happiness right and the happiness</text><text start="3698.84" dur="4.29">actually accessible now so then do I</text><text start="3701.63" dur="3.03">still have a reason to get buff or do I</text><text start="3703.13" dur="2.82">realize that was actually just nonsense</text><text start="3704.66" dur="7.92">maybe I do still have a reason to be</text><text start="3705.95" dur="8.49">buff it might be a different one yeah so</text><text start="3712.58" dur="3.75">your question around how when do you</text><text start="3714.44" dur="7.35">notice so kind of all the time you can</text><text start="3716.33" dur="7.32">notice do I feel like my I am being more</text><text start="3721.79" dur="3.93">of who I really want to be your question</text><text start="3723.65" dur="3.96">and I might becoming more of who I want</text><text start="3725.72" dur="5.28">to be because of the way I&apos;m showing up</text><text start="3727.61" dur="7.02">in this relationship in this job in this</text><text start="3731.0" dur="5.82">activity and if not if I&apos;m being less of</text><text start="3734.63" dur="3.82">or becoming less of what I really most</text><text start="3736.82" dur="3.94">value switch something</text><text start="3738.45" dur="4.47">yeah that&apos;s it&apos;s a sounds like a</text><text start="3740.76" dur="7.74">checking in process mhm</text><text start="3742.92" dur="7.28">I think that&apos;s that&apos;s something that we</text><text start="3748.5" dur="4.38">might want to look into doing more is</text><text start="3750.2" dur="5.68">how often are we checking and reflecting</text><text start="3752.88" dur="4.679">on what&apos;s going on well this is what</text><text start="3755.88" dur="3.6">mindfulness means is that can become</text><text start="3757.559" dur="4.201">continuous there can be a continuous</text><text start="3759.48" dur="5.01">noticing so there can be real-time</text><text start="3761.76" dur="4.319">correction because especially as one</text><text start="3764.49" dur="5.309">gets more powerful there so they&apos;re</text><text start="3766.079" dur="5.49">moving faster then it when they get a</text><text start="3769.799" dur="3.48">little bit off if they don&apos;t check in as</text><text start="3771.569" dur="3.78">fast they can get much further off of</text><text start="3773.279" dur="4.74">what really matters right quickly</text><text start="3775.349" dur="6.391">so there&apos;s there&apos;s a good argument for</text><text start="3778.019" dur="5.58">the practicalness practice and is an</text><text start="3781.74" dur="4.379">argument for why it&apos;s some more</text><text start="3783.599" dur="3.091">important the more powerful you get yeah</text><text start="3786.119" dur="1.861">absolutely</text><text start="3786.69" dur="10.109">it&apos;s the faster you&apos;re going the more</text><text start="3787.98" dur="10.859">steering matters what what are your</text><text start="3796.799" dur="5.22">favorite mindfulness practices or what</text><text start="3798.839" dur="6.191">is your what is your preferred method of</text><text start="3802.019" dur="5.301">improving mindfulness</text><text start="3805.03" dur="5.17">it&apos;s a huge topic right mindfulness</text><text start="3807.32" dur="5.28">basically means noticing what are you</text><text start="3810.2" dur="5.1">noticing so I can be mindful of my</text><text start="3812.6" dur="5.63">breath and so I&apos;m noticing my breath and</text><text start="3815.3" dur="5.22">the process noticing my body rising oh I</text><text start="3818.23" dur="2.77">wasn&apos;t I wasn&apos;t actually breathing very</text><text start="3820.52" dur="2.37">much</text><text start="3821.0" dur="3.6">or there&apos;s tightness or pain in my body</text><text start="3822.89" dur="3.36">I&apos;m haven&apos;t been paying attention to or</text><text start="3824.6" dur="3.12">there&apos;s a lot of anxiety I wasn&apos;t paying</text><text start="3826.25" dur="4.8">attention to what do I want to do about</text><text start="3827.72" dur="4.74">that right that may help you feel a lot</text><text start="3831.05" dur="2.85">better in your body might help you</text><text start="3832.46" dur="2.31">change things you need to change and I</text><text start="3833.9" dur="2.13">hope you live longer</text><text start="3834.77" dur="4.83">right because you notice something you</text><text start="3836.03" dur="5.91">tend to it so there&apos;s you know there&apos;s</text><text start="3839.6" dur="4.17">body based mindfulness</text><text start="3841.94" dur="7.34">there&apos;s noticing your thoughts and</text><text start="3843.77" dur="5.51">noticing how many of your thoughts are</text><text start="3850.109" dur="4.891">fundamentally in a positive empowering</text><text start="3852.309" dur="5.941">direction and how many of them are</text><text start="3855.0" dur="4.869">basically have no meaningful utility</text><text start="3858.25" dur="4.559">right like they are negative but not</text><text start="3859.869" dur="4.621">negative in a constructive way and then</text><text start="3862.809" dur="2.79">as soon as you notice that when you</text><text start="3864.49" dur="2.19">don&apos;t notice that you really have no</text><text start="3865.599" dur="2.611">choice cuz it&apos;s just an automated</text><text start="3866.68" dur="3.03">program running itself out you didn&apos;t</text><text start="3868.21" dur="3.839">choose the moment you notice it choice</text><text start="3869.71" dur="4.44">enters the possibility for choice enters</text><text start="3872.049" dur="2.97">you can say well do those thoughts</text><text start="3874.15" dur="2.459">affect how I feel</text><text start="3875.019" dur="3.241">yes do they affect how I perceive you</text><text start="3876.609" dur="4.081">have to they affect how I act yeah so</text><text start="3878.26" dur="3.69">how do I want to shift the thoughts so</text><text start="3880.69" dur="2.119">that I perceive enact it feel</text><text start="3881.95" dur="3.45">differently</text><text start="3882.809" dur="4.931">you can notice your emotion similarly</text><text start="3885.4" dur="5.939">and say oh when I notice I&apos;m feeling</text><text start="3887.74" dur="6.119">angry or agitated etcetera then I want</text><text start="3891.339" dur="4.23">to actually stop and see what I can do</text><text start="3893.859" dur="3.45">to shift my state and recenter because</text><text start="3895.569" dur="3.841">if I&apos;m acting from that state that&apos;s</text><text start="3897.309" dur="4.53">gonna be subtly affecting how I perceive</text><text start="3899.41" dur="5.01">and how I behave there&apos;s a lot of things</text><text start="3901.839" dur="4.591">you can notice you can notice that we&apos;re</text><text start="3904.42" dur="4.28">talking about here being in relationship</text><text start="3906.43" dur="2.27">and</text><text start="3909.45" dur="5.399">your own sense of being on path and</text><text start="3912.869" dur="5.281">being in relationship and how those</text><text start="3914.849" dur="6.031">relate to each other so there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="3918.15" dur="6.27">good mindfulness practices for various</text><text start="3920.88" dur="5.67">aspects of it and they cross apply right</text><text start="3924.42" dur="6.6">just increasing awareness is valuable</text><text start="3926.55" dur="7.559">but I would say a very deep one is if</text><text start="3931.02" dur="5.579">someone takes some time to write around</text><text start="3934.109" dur="4.711">being like you were saying I want to be</text><text start="3936.599" dur="4.441">a person that invokes people&apos;s trust in</text><text start="3938.82" dur="7.519">is worthy of it want to be a person who</text><text start="3941.04" dur="7.38">has character that leads to me being a</text><text start="3946.339" dur="4.24">support and a pillar for the community</text><text start="3948.42" dur="3.96">not because I asked to be but because</text><text start="3950.579" dur="3.361">people just recognize that I show up in</text><text start="3952.38" dur="4.16">a way that supports me buddy so you kind</text><text start="3953.94" dur="5.52">of look who do I really want to be and</text><text start="3956.54" dur="4.18">then what how do I most want to become</text><text start="3959.46" dur="2.639">what I most want to do what are the</text><text start="3960.72" dur="3.619">things I really want to contribute to it</text><text start="3962.099" dur="5.641">and you mind this and then you ask why</text><text start="3964.339" dur="4.841">on all these things and you say how much</text><text start="3967.74" dur="2.97">of that is still because of some</text><text start="3969.18" dur="2.97">unconscious shit that my parents taught</text><text start="3970.71" dur="2.94">me how much of it is still because I&apos;m</text><text start="3972.15" dur="3.449">insecure and don&apos;t think I&apos;m enough and</text><text start="3973.65" dur="5.58">this is my compensation strategy and</text><text start="3975.599" dur="5.161">then you see can I let that go and then</text><text start="3979.23" dur="3.839">what do I actually want underneath that</text><text start="3980.76" dur="6.18">and you get deeper and deeper of what do</text><text start="3983.069" dur="7.621">I really value and then you&apos;re mindful</text><text start="3986.94" dur="5.879">of is what I&apos;m doing right now is what</text><text start="3990.69" dur="4.77">I&apos;m thinking right now is the state I&apos;m</text><text start="3992.819" dur="4.481">in right now aligned with what I most</text><text start="3995.46" dur="6.06">deeply value</text><text start="3997.3" dur="4.22">and if so great and if not shift</text><text start="4001.859" dur="7.271">simplicity I think that&apos;s a it&apos;s</text><text start="4007.059" dur="4.441">probably one of the not probably I think</text><text start="4009.13" dur="6.179">that&apos;s the best explanation around</text><text start="4011.5" dur="6.329">mindfulness and the argument for why you</text><text start="4015.309" dur="8.27">might pick up a meditation practice</text><text start="4017.829" dur="5.75">which is a practice of noticing</text><text start="4026.3" dur="2.39">with</text><text start="4031.14" dur="5.04">is not yeah there&apos;s not intentional plug</text><text start="4033.39" dur="4.95">even but the supplement quality which</text><text start="4036.18" dur="7.83">you created I&apos;ve been taking it for a</text><text start="4038.34" dur="9.93">year I&apos;ve noticed that it has helped</text><text start="4044.01" dur="6.54">create an expanded awareness for myself</text><text start="4048.27" dur="5.43">and then I would say my wife even</text><text start="4050.55" dur="11.3">explain what she&apos;s report has

dur="7.92">meaningful memory intelligence right</text><text start="4433.29" dur="7.78">agency is our ability to in disposition</text><text start="4438.16" dur="5.19">to make choices or follow through our</text><text start="4441.07" dur="4.2">responsibilities or drive or resilience</text><text start="4443.35" dur="4.35">or all you know all the things that move</text><text start="4445.27" dur="6.71">us in universe and our sentience is</text><text start="4447.7" dur="6.93">actually our depth of feeling and our</text><text start="4451.98" dur="4.81">feelings of our self our feeling

agency</text><text start="4467.47" dur="9.33">very much relates to becoming and being</text><text start="4474.04" dur="5.85">and sentient SAR very related and the</text><text start="4476.8" dur="5.19">intelligence can help reconcile the</text><text start="4479.89" dur="5.94">relationships between those so if you</text><text start="4481.99" dur="6.32">think about evolving sentient

dur="4.92">of deep compassion embodied awareness</text><text start="4493.48" dur="5.52">etc evolving intelligence looks like</text><text start="4496.24" dur="5.43">polymath right like full genius

dur="4.65">agency to do to actually take care of a</text><text start="4534.31" dur="4.17">lot of shit right and so we define all</text><text start="4536.92" dur="3.45">of those together the volume of

of</text><text start="4777.2" dur="1.8">governance of infrastructure of world</text><text start="4778.61" dur="2.19">view</text><text start="4779.0" dur="5.76">we&apos;re also to place with a current world</text><text start="4780.8" dur="8.22">it really is ending and having to change</text><text start="4784.76" dur="5.97">and so then we it feels antiquated I&apos;m</text><text start="4789.02" dur="3.99">not sure if it&apos;s a generational thing on</text><text start="4790.73" dur="4.2">if every generation feels this well no</text><text start="4793.01" dur="5.24">this is not just generational there&apos;s</text><text start="4794.93" dur="6.96">generational stuff but there&apos;s there&apos;s</text><text start="4798.25" dur="5.98">since the plow we started you know</text><text start="4801.89" dur="3.66">removing stuff from Earth faster than we</text><text start="4804.23" dur="2.46">were regenerating it and since the</text><text start="4805.55" dur="4.17">Industrial Revolution</text><text start="4806.69" dur="4.2">you know exponentially faster and we&apos;re</text><text start="4809.72" dur="4.08">actually talking about the end of a</text><text start="4810.89" dur="5.28">phase that started then so it&apos;s not that</text><text start="4813.8" dur="4.5">long well not that long in evolutionary</text><text start="4816.17" dur="7.83">terms but the entirety of what we call</text><text start="4818.3" dur="8.16">recorded history yeah yeah considering</text><text start="4824.0" dur="6.62">so from evolutionary not long from you</text><text start="4826.46" dur="7.29">know from human awareness of our own</text><text start="4830.62" dur="4.9">history standpoint the whole of what</text><text start="4833.75" dur="4.19">we&apos;ve had so far as a phase coming to an</text><text start="4835.52" dur="5.31">end which has been a phase defined by</text><text start="4837.94" dur="5.05">finite games zero-sum games finite</text><text start="4840.83" dur="3.45">amount of resources and the total number</text><text start="4842.99" dur="2.58">of us are growing and were competing for</text><text start="4844.28" dur="2.94">those finite resources and if you have</text><text start="4845.57" dur="6.27">them I don&apos;t if I have them you don&apos;t</text><text start="4847.22" dur="6.3">and so our answer is pull the resource</text><text start="4851.84" dur="3.45">set a nature faster and compete with</text><text start="4853.52" dur="3.39">each other harder and now our tools of</text><text start="4855.29" dur="3.39">competition our tools of warfare are big</text><text start="4856.91" dur="3.63">enough to destroy the entire planet and</text><text start="4858.68" dur="3.78">we our ability to pull the resources out</text><text start="4860.54" dur="3.48">is enough that it can also destroy the</text><text start="4862.46" dur="4.38">whole planet so we&apos;ve outgrown the</text><text start="4864.02" dur="3.45">playing field and so that game is coming</text><text start="4866.84" dur="3.93">to an end</text><text start="4867.47" dur="5.13">so either we end with that game or we</text><text start="4870.77" dur="3.18">create a new game in the new game will</text><text start="4872.6" dur="3.15">be an infinite game not a finite game</text><text start="4873.95" dur="3.66">it&apos;ll be a positive something zero-sum</text><text start="4875.75" dur="6.15">and it&apos;ll be one where fundamentally our</text><text start="4877.61" dur="6.51">ability to thrive another business</text><text start="4881.9" dur="4.59">ability to thrive or not in opposition</text><text start="4884.12" dur="5.01">to each other yeah and that is an</text><text start="4886.49" dur="5.73">economic model shift right it is a</text><text start="4889.13" dur="4.38">worldview shift it is and we could do</text><text start="4892.22" dur="3.06">another show just focused on these</text><text start="4893.51" dur="2.25">topics that&apos;s exactly what I was going</text><text start="4895.28" dur="2.489">to suggest</text><text start="4895.76" dur="3.75">I&apos;ve been we&apos;re going from the micro to</text><text start="4897.769" dur="2.281">the macro here&apos;s where we&apos;ll tie them</text><text start="4899.51" dur="8.839">together</text><text start="4900.05" dur="8.299">yeah we live in a time when</text><text start="4908.64" dur="4.11">there is more</text><text start="4913.49" dur="5.67">at stake than there has ever been where</text><text start="4917.18" dur="4.95">because of the magnitude of our</text><text start="4919.16" dur="4.29">technology we can all affect more than</text><text start="4922.13" dur="2.88">anyone has ever been able to affect</text><text start="4923.45" dur="6.39">Gandhi couldn&apos;t put things on YouTube</text><text start="4925.01" dur="6.6">and get virality right and so we we have</text><text start="4929.84" dur="5.04">the potential to affect things in a way</text><text start="4931.61" dur="5.67">that it could actually contribute to</text><text start="4934.88" dur="4.44">moving in the direction of humans mount</text><text start="4937.28" dur="3.45">continuing or a higher quality of life</text><text start="4939.32" dur="4.62">than anyone has ever been able to</text><text start="4940.73" dur="5.46">realize emerging so this is this is the</text><text start="4943.94" dur="6.48">context for all of us contemplating our</text><text start="4946.19" dur="7.23">becoming so the being side is I can</text><text start="4950.42" dur="6.87">access the same state of timeless</text><text start="4953.42" dur="5.91">fullness and beauty now that people</text><text start="4957.29" dur="5.9">could in the time of Buddha right</text><text start="4959.33" dur="6.86">because it&apos;s eternal it&apos;s timeless and</text><text start="4963.19" dur="6.7">that can be a place I can access as</text><text start="4966.19" dur="5.62">respite and as fuel to then come in to</text><text start="4969.89" dur="3.03">this actual time which is very different</text><text start="4971.81" dur="4.59">than the time of Buddha or any other</text><text start="4972.92" dur="6.14">time and say my becoming is not to win</text><text start="4976.4" dur="5.25">at a game that is dying</text><text start="4979.06" dur="4.69">but is to actually try and help change</text><text start="4981.65" dur="6.69">the game what is my role what is the</text><text start="4983.75" dur="6.93">role that I could have in self</text><text start="4988.34" dur="6.69">actualizing in a way that serves not</text><text start="4990.68" dur="5.88">just me but all life so I&apos;ll just leave</text><text start="4995.03" dur="4.47">it as a thought to tie the
