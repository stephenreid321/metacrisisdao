dur="2.971">is and we&apos;re starting to touch on a</text><text start="111.27" dur="4.59">couple things here but this goes deep</text><text start="113.13" dur="4.23">and how do we make good choices if we</text><text start="115.86" dur="5.28">don&apos;t have good sense making well</text><text start="117.36" dur="5.67">obviously we can&apos;t but due to increasing</text><text start="121.14" dur="3.6">technological capacity right increasing</text><text start="123.03" dur="5.819">population multiplied by increasing</text><text start="124.74" dur="6.299">impact per person we&apos;re making

those choices which is kind of</text><text start="135.03" dur="9.03">running increasingly fast through the</text><text start="138.31" dur="8.61">woods increasingly blind right and so I</text><text start="144.06" dur="4.81">think many of the people that you&apos;ve had</text><text start="146.92" dur="5.88">on Robo wisdom have been in a deep</text><text start="148.87" dur="5.729">inquiry around how do we actually fix</text><text start="152.8" dur="3.15">our own sense making and it&apos;s some of</text><text start="154.599" dur="3.271">what has brought us to have</text><text start="155.95" dur="4.23">conversations with each other because a</text><text start="157.87" dur="5.16">part of how we work with our own sense</text><text start="160.18" dur="5.67">making as we recognize the cognitive</text><text start="163.03" dur="5.1">complexity of issues that the world</text><text start="165.85" dur="3.84">faces is more than a single person can</text><text start="168.13" dur="3.09">process a single brain that can&apos;t</text><text start="169.69" dur="3.54">actually hold that cognitive complexity</text><text start="171.22" dur="3.98">so it requires collective intelligence</text><text start="173.23" dur="4.86">and collective sense making</text><text start="175.2" dur="6.009">but I can&apos;t just offload the cognitive</text><text start="178.09" dur="4.92">complexity to some Authority because I</text><text start="181.209" dur="3.451">can&apos;t trust that they&apos;re actually doing</text><text start="183.01" dur="2.729">good sense making maybe they&apos;re doing</text><text start="184.66" dur="3.45">good sense making within a very limited</text><text start="185.739" dur="4.231">context but then the application of that</text><text start="188.11" dur="3.09">outside of the context is different and</text><text start="189.97" dur="2.97">maybe there&apos;s even distortions within</text><text start="191.2" dur="3.119">their context so I have to try and find</text><text start="192.94" dur="2.76">other people that are also really</text><text start="194.319" dur="3.351">endeavoring to sense make well which</text><text start="195.7" dur="4.65">means they have to understand what</text><text start="197.67" dur="3.819">causes failures and sense making and</text><text start="200.35" dur="2.52">then we have to see can we create</text><text start="201.489" dur="3.901">relationships with each other that</text><text start="202.87" dur="9.589">removed the distortion basis that is</text><text start="205.39" dur="9.569">normally there so I think I think what I</text><text start="212.459" dur="5.081">from what I have seen of rebel wisdom</text><text start="214.959" dur="4.261">this is probably the strange attractor</text><text start="217.54" dur="3.569">of what is bringing everybody to watch</text><text start="219.22" dur="3.329">it is people who are trying to make</text><text start="221.109" dur="4.681">sense of the world better themselves and</text><text start="222.549" dur="5.431">are trying to find sources of content of</text><text start="225.79" dur="5.069">other other people that have been trying</text><text start="227.98" dur="5.31">to make sense of it well which is what</text><text start="230.859" dur="4.111">I&apos;m excited about and so those are just</text><text start="233.29" dur="6.509">some opening thoughts and yeah I look</text><text start="234.97" dur="6.599">forward to getting into why we have as</text><text start="239.799" dur="4.59">broken and information ecology as we</text><text start="241.569" dur="6.631">have and what it would take to correct</text><text start="244.389" dur="5.461">that at a at scale and how we can make</text><text start="248.2" dur="3.36">sense of the world even in the broken</text><text start="249.85" dur="3.63">information ecology now in terms of</text><text start="251.56" dur="5.41">practical process</text><text start="253.48" dur="6.19">I&apos;ve never actually shared publicly</text><text start="256.97" dur="10.199">these types of frameworks before so this</text><text start="259.67" dur="14.37">feels fun and exciting and I hope that&apos;s</text><text start="267.169" dur="9.361">useful as I&apos;ve been trying to make sense</text><text start="274.04" dur="8.45">of the world making sense of why since</text><text start="276.53" dur="5.96">making it so hard is pretty central</text><text start="284.56" dur="4.75">there&apos;s a famous quote I think</text><text start="287.03" dur="5.61">attributed to Einstein make things as</text><text start="289.31" dur="5.64">simple as possible but not simpler as</text><text start="292.64" dur="5.4">simple as possible really the goal isn&apos;t</text><text start="294.95" dur="5.46">is as clear as possible right but</text><text start="298.04" dur="8.58">simpler would mean it&apos;s wrong like it&apos;s</text><text start="300.41" dur="7.74">not accurate anymore if I&apos;m you know</text><text start="306.62" dur="3.57">you&apos;re gonna have to face this doing</text><text start="308.15" dur="4.32">media work there will be pressures on</text><text start="310.19" dur="4.02">you to say hey people can&apos;t pay</text><text start="312.47" dur="3.33">attention more than sound bytes you got</text><text start="314.21" dur="3.03">to make it five minute chunks so the</text><text start="315.8" dur="3.8">word size is too big make it for an</text><text start="317.24" dur="3.96">eighth grade level right which is saying</text><text start="319.6" dur="4.569">people are dumb</text><text start="321.2" dur="5.19">so spoon feed them stuff that dumb</text><text start="324.169" dur="3.391">people can handle which to the degree</text><text start="326.39" dur="4.95">you do that and it&apos;s successful will</text><text start="327.56" dur="6.47">keep people dumb but that&apos;s what that&apos;s</text><text start="331.34" dur="5.88">what like those are the pressures in in</text><text start="334.03" dur="6.94">anyone doing broadcast even for a</text><text start="337.22" dur="6.0">hopefully good intention right and if we</text><text start="340.97" dur="6.96">want people to actually be able to make</text><text start="343.22" dur="7.74">sense of the world well you can&apos;t do it</text><text start="347.93" dur="6.42">in very short periods of time with lots</text><text start="350.96" dur="6.36">of distraction and oversimplified like</text><text start="354.35" dur="4.74">if you if you look at anyone who</text><text start="357.32" dur="3.87">actually increased the sense making</text><text start="359.09" dur="4.17">capacity of the world you look at any</text><text start="361.19" dur="5.7">scientist or philosopher they didn&apos;t do</text><text start="363.26" dur="6.6">it in tweets and they didn&apos;t do it</text><text start="366.89" dur="6.62">radically distracted and they didn&apos;t do</text><text start="369.86" dur="7.98">it in a dumb down process right like I</text><text start="373.51" dur="8.17">have I have so many people who have</text><text start="377.84" dur="6.49">written to me saying like we want to</text><text start="381.68" dur="4.69">create a new kind of Education</text><text start="384.33" dur="7.23">young people we want to create a new</text><text start="386.37" dur="7.49">kind of education that makes everybody</text><text start="391.56" dur="5.19">like Bucky fuller or Leonardo sits</text><text start="393.86" dur="4.089">conditions polymaths and they say this</text><text start="396.75" dur="5.31">because I&apos;ve written some stuff on that</text><text start="397.949" dur="6.56">topic and that they have some sense that</text><text start="402.06" dur="8.849">they could lead that and I&apos;m like</text><text start="404.509" dur="10.421">have you read Bucky&apos;s books like well no</text><text start="410.909" dur="5.73">we mostly don&apos;t read books and have you</text><text start="414.93" dur="3.449">read the references in Bucky&apos;s books</text><text start="416.639" dur="3.661">just see the amount of [ __ ] that he read</text><text start="418.379" dur="4.831">and referenced to make sense of things</text><text start="420.3" dur="5.399">well and so there&apos;s a there there&apos;s a</text><text start="423.21" dur="4.019">decoupling of the sense of the agency</text><text start="425.699" dur="3.541">possible with what it takes to do it</text><text start="427.229" dur="5.22">it&apos;s you know like that there&apos;s a saying</text><text start="429.24" dur="4.889">everywhere in almost all domains to this</text><text start="432.449" dur="3.09">effect of like everybody wants to be</text><text start="434.129" dur="3.301">buff but nobody wants to lift heavy ass</text><text start="435.539" dur="3.241">weights or everybody wants to win and</text><text start="437.43" dur="5.449">nobody wants to work harder there&apos;s</text><text start="438.78" dur="4.099">something like that that happens here is</text><text start="443.84" dur="5.31">if I want to be able to make sense of</text><text start="446.849" dur="5.07">the world well I have to work at that</text><text start="449.15" dur="4.54">and if I want to be able to make sense</text><text start="451.919" dur="3.691">of the world better that the world</text><text start="453.69" dur="8.4">better than I currently do like</text><text start="455.61" dur="8.089">attention requires being trained just</text><text start="462.09" dur="3.99">like muscles require being trained</text><text start="463.699" dur="6.46">thinking clearly requires being trained</text><text start="466.08" dur="5.67">and anytime there&apos;s a hormetic process</text><text start="470.159" dur="3.391">you know hormesis is the principle by</text><text start="471.75" dur="4.229">which you stress an adaptive system to</text><text start="473.55" dur="4.14">increase its adaptive capacity so I have</text><text start="475.979" dur="3.361">to stress a muscle to get the muscle to</text><text start="477.69" dur="4.46">grow if I&apos;m lifting an amount of weight</text><text start="479.34" dur="5.1">that&apos;s super easy the muscle there&apos;s no</text><text start="482.15" dur="3.4">input that says the muscle needs to be</text><text start="484.44" dur="2.939">bigger and there&apos;s a cost to getting</text><text start="485.55" dur="3.51">bigger right so it&apos;s only gonna go</text><text start="487.379" dur="3.991">through that cost if it&apos;s being stressed</text><text start="489.06" dur="4.229">and the same is true like if I expose</text><text start="491.37" dur="3.599">myself to more heat and more cold than</text><text start="493.289" dur="3.451">as comfortable actually gain greater</text><text start="494.969" dur="3.181">metabolic flexibility to deal with heat</text><text start="496.74" dur="3.03">and cold which means that if I stay in</text><text start="498.15" dur="2.609">an environment where I always have</text><text start="499.77" dur="2.97">heating and air conditioning I&apos;ll</text><text start="500.759" dur="3.571">actually lose metabolic flexibility you</text><text start="502.74" dur="3.239">have to stress the system to be able to</text><text start="504.33" dur="2.85">grow the system and in a particular kind</text><text start="505.979" dur="2.701">of way and not all stressors are gonna</text><text start="507.18" dur="4.769">grow the system but this is definitely</text><text start="508.68" dur="6.0">true cognitively which means if I keep</text><text start="511.949" dur="5.931">paying attention to hyper normal stimuli</text><text start="514.68" dur="3.2">that are</text><text start="517.92" dur="7.36">moving quickly so I get the stimuli of</text><text start="520.93" dur="7.32">lots of novelty I&apos;m gonna be decreasing</text><text start="525.28" dur="4.98">my attention but if I want to have any</text><text start="528.25" dur="4.08">kind of nuanced view I have to be able</text><text start="530.26" dur="5.25">to hold multiple partial views in</text><text start="532.33" dur="4.77">working memory it&apos;s not that some people</text><text start="535.51" dur="3.66">have good memory or good attention and</text><text start="537.1" dur="3.57">other people don&apos;t intrinsically it any</text><text start="539.17" dur="3.15">more than some people are buff and some</text><text start="540.67" dur="5.72">aren&apos;t intrinsically it&apos;s developable</text><text start="542.32" dur="4.07">but it has to actually be developed so</text><text start="547.98" dur="4.24">so the impulse to say hey make it really</text><text start="550.54" dur="3.24">simple so everybody can get it and the</text><text start="552.22" dur="3.21">impulse to say help people actually make</text><text start="553.78" dur="5.48">sense of the world well or are different</text><text start="555.43" dur="6.12">things now some people will make stuff</text><text start="559.26" dur="5.35">technical seeming intentionally to</text><text start="561.55" dur="5.43">obscure it as a power game right so that</text><text start="564.61" dur="4.95">to encourage others to defer their sense</text><text start="566.98"

dur="7.44">of those things but that&apos;s actually what</text><text start="619.18" dur="7.35">increasing sovereignty means so</text><text start="625.06" dur="3.3">information apology is that there&apos;s a</text><text start="626.53" dur="3.57">there&apos;s a whole ecosystem of information</text><text start="628.36" dur="3.6">right like we have information coming in</text><text start="630.1" dur="3.54">from marketing information coming in</text><text start="631.96" dur="5.4">from government sources from campaigning</text><text start="633.64" dur="5.13">from just what our neighbors tell us and</text><text start="637.36" dur="5.37">our friends tell us from social media</text><text start="638.77" dur="5.52">from like and we use information to make</text><text start="642.73" dur="4.08">sense of the world to make choices that</text><text start="644.29" dur="4.71">are aligned with whatever our goals are</text><text start="646.81" dur="2.76">and our values and what&apos;s meaningful to</text><text start="649.0" dur="5.88">us</text><text start="649.57" dur="7.939">and what we hope is that the information</text><text start="654.88" dur="4.949">around us is mostly true and</text><text start="657.509" dur="4.57">representative of reality so that we can</text><text start="659.829" dur="4.651">use that to make choices that will be</text><text start="662.079" dur="3.901">effective when I say broken information</text><text start="664.48" dur="3.299">ecology it means that we can&apos;t trust</text><text start="665.98" dur="3.81">that most of the information coming in</text><text start="667.779" dur="3.75">is true and representative of reality</text><text start="669.79" dur="3.33">and will inform good choice making and</text><text start="671.529" dur="3.36">so then this is where we have to get</text><text start="673.12" dur="5.82">into ok so where does information come</text><text start="674.889" dur="6.711">from right signals are being shared by</text><text start="678.94" dur="5.55">people and by groups of people that have</text><text start="681.6" dur="4.75">shared agency like corporations and</text><text start="684.49" dur="8.459">governments and political parties and</text><text start="686.35" dur="8.37">religions and whatever right and so we</text><text start="692.949" dur="4.471">want to start getting into why do people</text><text start="694.72" dur="5.25">share information other than just</text><text start="697.42" dur="6.27">sharing what is true and representative</text><text start="699.97" dur="9.539">of

I</text><text start="711.459" dur="4.141">was just referencing which is the</text><text start="713.5" dur="4.889">difference between true and truthful</text><text start="715.6" dur="5.34">it&apos;s a first important distinction when</text><text start="718.389" dur="5.671">we say someone&apos;s being truthful what we</text><text start="720.94" dur="5.07">mean is that what they if you&apos;re

dur="4.06">right that there&apos;s a correspondence</text><text start="730.75" dur="4.17">between the signal that you&apos;re</text><text start="732.61" dur="6.029">communicating to me and what you believe</text><text start="734.92" dur="6.56">is true so we can look at breakdowns of</text><text start="738.639" dur="4.831">truthfulness which is where people are</text><text start="741.48" dur="3.76">distorting information with some</text><text start="743.47" dur="4.919">intentionality and that can either be</text><text start="745.24" dur="6.199">through overt lying or through lying</text><text start="748.389" dur="5.88">through omission or lying through</text><text start="751.439" dur="6.671">emphasis bias right those kinds of</text><text start="754.269" dur="5.67">things so that&apos;s truthful and when we</text><text start="758.11" dur="4.8">say something is true what we typically</text><text start="759.939" dur="4.741">mean and this is actually this gets very</text><text start="762.91" dur="5.01">nuanced and we end up having to get into</text><text start="764.68" dur="4.8">like fundamental epistemology ontology</text><text start="767.92" dur="2.669">concepts of what does it mean for</text><text start="769.48" dur="3.029">something to be true what are our</text><text start="770.589" dur="4.8">fundamental axioms about the nature of</text><text start="772.509" dur="5.101">reality I&apos;ll put that on hold for now</text><text start="775.389" dur="3.541">and just say in general if we say that</text><text start="777.61" dur="2.7">someone&apos;s saying something that&apos;s true</text><text start="778.93" dur="2.88">we don&apos;t just mean that there&apos;s a</text><text start="780.31" dur="3.43">correspondence between what they&apos;re</text><text start="781.81" dur="2.98">saying and what they think but there&apos;s a</text><text start="783.74" dur="2.67">corresponds between what they&apos;re saying</text><text start="784.79" dur="6.66">and some independently verifiable</text><text start="786.41" dur="7.05">reality and so of course someone can be</text><text start="791.45" dur="3.33">truthful meaning they say what they</text><text start="793.46" dur="2.52">believe but what they believe is</text><text start="794.78" dur="2.46">misinformed because they did</text><text start="795.98" dur="4.2">sense-making poorly so they&apos;re</text><text start="797.24" dur="9.12">propagating information honestly but</text><text start="800.18" dur="9.69">that is not true and so we need to look</text><text start="806.36" dur="5.43">at distortions in both of these there&apos;s</text><text start="809.87" dur="4.95">a third thing which is representative</text><text start="811.79" dur="4.71">which is it&apos;s possible for someone to be</text><text start="814.82" dur="3.78">truthful share exactly what they think</text><text start="816.5" dur="3.69">is going on and that what they&apos;re</text><text start="818.6" dur="3.53">sharing is actually true they&apos;ve</text><text start="820.19" dur="3.93">actually done good epistemology and</text><text start="822.13" dur="4.66">empirically validated that what they&apos;re</text><text start="824.12" dur="5.94">saying maps to reality and in some clear</text><text start="826.79" dur="6.23">way and yet the interpretation I get</text><text start="830.06" dur="6.75">from that will still actually mislead me</text><text start="833.02" dur="7.27">because it&apos;s not the true information is</text><text start="836.81" dur="6.75">not representative of the entire context</text><text start="840.29" dur="4.86">well articles published and famous</text><text start="843.56" dur="2.73">journals peer-reviewed scientific</text><text start="845.15" dur="3.78">journals like Journal of American</text><text start="846.29" dur="4.53">Medical Association five years later</text><text start="848.93" dur="3.27">we&apos;ll see that a major percentage of</text><text start="850.82" dur="4.56">them something like fifty percent are</text><text start="852.2" dur="6.15">found to be mostly inaccurate fifty</text><text start="855.38" dur="6.48">percent is a coin toss right or we see</text><text start="858.35" dur="6.57">the replication crisis or we see that</text><text start="861.86" dur="4.86">the things that get studied even if it&apos;s</text><text start="864.92" dur="4.35">true information it can be misleading</text><text start="866.72" dur="4.29">because for the most part where does the</text><text start="869.27" dur="4.44">money to fund the research come from</text><text start="871.01" dur="4.35">it&apos;s gonna come within capitalism mostly</text><text start="873.71" dur="3.81">where there&apos;s some ROI on the research</text><text start="875.36" dur="3.51">and so some areas have moral ROI than</text><text start="877.52" dur="3.18">others so even a bunch of true</text><text start="878.87" dur="3.41">information but that is weighted towards</text><text start="880.7" dur="4.95">certain parts of the information ecology</text><text start="882.28" dur="5.08">over others create misrepresentation</text><text start="885.65" dur="3.27">through preponderance of information</text><text start="887.36" dur="3.75">right so even a bunch of true</text><text start="888.92" dur="5.1">information can create distortion so</text><text start="891.11" dur="5.16">then you start to say oh okay so the</text><text start="894.02" dur="3.72">essence of science within the philosophy</text><text start="896.27" dur="3.6">of science the essence of it is</text><text start="897.74" dur="4.5">earnestness of inquiry right it&apos;s</text><text start="899.87" dur="5.64">empiricism but then earnestness of</text><text start="902.24" dur="4.98">inquiry eddington defined science as the</text><text start="905.51" dur="5.31">earnest endeavor to put into order the</text><text start="907.22" dur="7.11">facts of experience and the essence of</text><text start="910.82" dur="5.56">capitalism is see you can say the</text><text start="914.33" dur="4.69">essence of science is no bias</text><text start="916.38" dur="3.99">right at least the idea the spirit of it</text><text start="919.02" dur="2.7">we can get into where even the</text><text start="920.37" dur="6.12">philosophy of science has built an</text><text start="921.72" dur="6.9">axiomatic bias later but then the in</text><text start="926.49" dur="4.05">capitalism it is about optimizing for</text><text start="928.62" dur="3.9">bias right like I actually have an</text><text start="930.54" dur="4.08">agency that I&apos;m trying to get ahead I</text><text start="932.52" dur="7.2">have intention to increase my balance</text><text start="934.62" dur="6.84">sheet and so if there is capital funding</text><text start="939.72" dur="3.6">of science it&apos;s going to fund the things</text><text start="941.46" dur="3.09">that create ROI on that research so we</text><text start="943.32" dur="3.06">can keep doing more research that</text><text start="944.55" dur="5.76">creates both a reason to distort the</text><text start="946.38" dur="5.73">info and the reason to withhold</text><text start="950.31" dur="4.08">information that is a source of</text><text start="952.11" dur="5.37">competitive advantage a reason to create</text><text start="954.39" dur="5.55">this info to other competitors and to at</text><text start="957.48" dur="5.28">least wait you know of course in biotech</text><text start="959.94" dur="4.83">if I can get a patent on a synthetic</text><text start="962.76" dur="3.93">molecule and I can&apos;t get a patent on a</text><text start="964.77" dur="3.63">natural molecule does a lot more money</text><text start="966.69" dur="3.24">is gonna go into synthetic molecules in</text><text start="968.4" dur="2.64">natural and then we look it and say well</text><text start="969.93" dur="2.97">there&apos;s not that many phase 3 clinical</text><text start="971.04" dur="3.84">trials on herbs and there are on Pharma</text><text start="972.9" dur="4.59">meds so the pharma meds must be more</text><text start="974.88" dur="5.22">accurate no this is a even true</text><text start="977.49" dur="4.44">information preponderance of data is</text><text start="980.1" dur="3.54">going to create problems right and</text><text start="981.93" dur="3.3">that&apos;s actually true information that is</text><text start="983.64" dur="3.05">being shared truthfully that would still</text><text start="985.23" dur="3.57">be misrepresentative of</text><text start="986.69" dur="4.3">reality so this is where I have to say</text><text start="988.8" dur="4.47">do I have some sense of what the actual</text><text start="990.99" dur="4.29">territory is and do I have a sense that</text><text start="993.27" dur="4.64">the map that&apos;s being created actually</text><text start="995.28" dur="5.88">maps onto the territory reasonably well</text><text start="997.91" dur="5.35">because sense making means map</text><text start="1001.16" dur="4.17">generation right to be able to make</text><text start="1003.26" dur="3.9">choices of how we navigate how we do</text><text start="1005.33" dur="6.81">choice making in relationships with some</text><text start="1007.16" dur="6.87">actual territory so that&apos;s true truthful</text><text start="1012.14" dur="7.14">and then representative and we can look</text><text start="1014.03" dur="6.87">at distortions and all three of those so</text><text start="1019.28" dur="6.63">when we look at white as an individual</text><text start="1020.9" dur="8.78">distort information the the most</text><text start="1025.91" dur="3.77">fundamental way of thinking about it is</text><text start="1030.61" dur="5.35">there&apos;s this idea in terms of signaling</text><text start="1034.19" dur="3.72">like if I&apos;m just nature watching and I&apos;m</text><text start="1035.96" dur="3.98">watching what is happening with rabbits</text><text start="1037.91" dur="3.9">and trees and birds I&apos;m getting</text><text start="1039.94" dur="2.97">information about them that they aren&apos;t</text><text start="1041.81" dur="4.04">even intending</text><text start="1042.91" dur="4.47">to transmit and so the information is</text><text start="1045.85" dur="3.63">just reflective right lights actually</text><text start="1047.38" dur="4.919">reflecting off of them of the nature of</text><text start="1049.48" dur="6.51">reality as soon as there&apos;s an agent that</text><text start="1052.299" dur="6.181">can share information strategically for</text><text start="1055.99" dur="4.71">an intention then I don&apos;t know if what</text><text start="1058.48" dur="3.96">they&apos;re sharing is reflective of reality</text><text start="1060.7" dur="3.99">or reflective of what they think will</text><text start="1062.44" dur="3.78">advance their intention and that&apos;s kind</text><text start="1064.69" dur="3.69">of the key distinction is that the</text><text start="1066.22" dur="3.87">moment we get abstract signaling which</text><text start="1068.38" dur="3.9">language allows us and the ability to</text><text start="1070.09" dur="5.94">kind of forecast in our ability to model</text><text start="1072.28" dur="5.82">each other and your well-being and the</text><text start="1076.03" dur="3.93">basis of your agency doesn&apos;t seem</text><text start="1078.1" dur="3.99">coupled with my well-being in the basis</text><text start="1079.96" dur="4.829">of my agency perfectly in the case of</text><text start="1082.09" dur="4.5">the partner wanting to cheat and get</text><text start="1084.789" dur="3.87">away with it right there&apos;s a decoupling</text><text start="1086.59" dur="5.64">of well being an agency in the case of</text><text start="1088.659" dur="5.721">if I&apos;m a marketer of a product and I</text><text start="1092.23" dur="4.38">want you to purchase it</text><text start="1094.38" dur="4.6">whether my product is actually the best</text><text start="1096.61" dur="4.29">product or not whether a competitor&apos;s</text><text start="1098.98" dur="3.84">product is better whether you need the</text><text start="1100.9" dur="3.06">product or not I want you to think that</text><text start="1102.82" dur="2.31">you need it and to think that mine is</text><text start="1103.96" dur="3.32">the best right so there&apos;s a breakdown</text><text start="1105.13" dur="4.56">between what seems to be in my</text><text start="1107.28" dur="7.95">well-being and what seems to be in your</text><text start="1109.69" dur="9.239">well-being so wherever there is a any</text><text start="1115.23" dur="6.16">misalignment in agency and there&apos;s the</text><text start="1118.929" dur="5.191">ability to share signal for strategic</text><text start="1121.39" dur="4.71">purposes then you have a basis to have</text><text start="1124.12" dur="5.28">signal that&apos;s being shared that isn&apos;t</text><text start="1126.1" dur="5.1">just truthful right so then we look at</text><text start="1129.4" dur="4.92">where is that happening and it&apos;s [ __ ]</text><text start="1131.2" dur="4.83">everywhere right to really gross or</text><text start="1134.32" dur="5.46">subtle degrees pretty much everywhere</text><text start="1136.03" dur="6.96">and sometimes for dreadful purposes like</text><text start="1139.78" dur="5.55">I mean you got the prosaic purposes</text><text start="1142.99" dur="5.16">which are basically market type dynamics</text><text start="1145.33" dur="4.469">which most of the dynamics in the world</text><text start="1148.15" dur="3.98">or market dynamics or at least</text><text start="1149.799" dur="6.181">influenced by market dynamics right</text><text start="1152.13" dur="6.72">market dynamics are fundamentally at</text><text start="1155.98" dur="5.37">least partially if not mostly rivalries</text><text start="1158.85" dur="4.03">meaning my balance she can get ahead</text><text start="1161.35" dur="2.88">independent of your balance she getting</text><text start="1162.88" dur="7.11">ahead and definitely independent of the</text><text start="1164.23" dur="8.189">Commons right and so in a market type</text><text start="1169.99" dur="4.62">dynamic I&apos;m going to be sharing</text><text start="1172.419" dur="6.421">information and this is why buyer beware</text><text start="1174.61" dur="5.819">but as soon buyer beware is not just you</text><text start="1178.84" dur="3.36">know check to make sure that the car</text><text start="1180.429" dur="3.24">isn&apos;t about to break down it&apos;s also</text><text start="1182.2" dur="3.63">check to make sure that the information</text><text start="1183.669" dur="3.961">shared is being true because if I&apos;m</text><text start="1185.83" dur="4.86">actually sharing information as a</text><text start="1187.63" dur="4.409">service right and you&apos;re purchasing that</text><text start="1190.69" dur="3.089">information whether it&apos;s whether you&apos;re</text><text start="1192.039" dur="4.11">paying for it with your attention that&apos;s</text><text start="1193.779" dur="4.461">being monetized through an ad or you&apos;re</text><text start="1196.149" dur="4.231">paying for it directly or whatever</text><text start="1198.24" dur="4.51">there&apos;s nothing that says I&apos;m sharing</text><text start="1200.38" dur="5.01">true and truthful information so in</text><text start="1202.75" dur="5.76">market type dynamics the the goal of</text><text start="1205.39" dur="5.639">marketing is that there is si as a</text><text start="1208.51" dur="5.22">company and from the supply side of</text><text start="1211.029" dur="6.12">supply and demand dynamics the goal is</text><text start="1213.73" dur="6.36">to compel the purchasers action in a</text><text start="1217.149" dur="4.801">particular way which means as a company</text><text start="1220.09" dur="4.35">I want to do sense making for you</text><text start="1221.95" dur="4.469">because I want to control your choice</text><text

attention because it&apos;s monetizing</text><text start="1549.05" dur="7.62">my attention right so I have to factor</text><text start="1554.51" dur="5.64">the agency the intention of the

dur="4.95">what the true information might be</text><text start="1565.21" dur="4.33">basically to infer what the source of</text><text start="1567.83" dur="3.27">distortion might be the same of the</text><text start="1569.54" dur="3.21">political candidate the same with</text><text start="1571.1" dur="2.62">science that&apos;s coming forward and I&apos;m</text><text start="1572.75" dur="5.2">looking at</text><text start="1573.72" dur="7.85">okay so who&apos;s who is seeking more grant</text><text start="1577.95" dur="6.42">funding and what is easiest to fund and</text><text

start="1603.0" dur="2.67">say kind of valuable thing when you&apos;re</text><text start="1604.41" dur="2.85">trying to do sense making is to</text><text start="1605.67" dur="4.17">recognize that the signal that you&apos;re</text><text start="1607.26" dur="7.26">getting everywhere is mostly strategic</text><text start="1609.84" dur="6.33">um strategic on the part of which is</text><text start="1614.52" dur="5.49">just another way to say intentional on</text><text start="1616.17" dur="6.84">the part of the agent sharing it for</text><text start="1620.01" dur="7.68">their purposes not yours and where there</text><text start="1623.01" dur="7.38">is a dis alignment between your well</text><text start="1627.69" dur="7.41">being and theirs or at least an apparent</text><text start="1630.39" dur="6.45">one then what their basis for intention</text><text start="1635.1" dur="5.19">might actually suck for you and even if</text><text start="1636.84" dur="5.25">there seems to be alignment you still</text><text start="1640.29" dur="4.62">don&apos;t want lied to for your good you</text><text start="1642.09" dur="4.11">still want your information so I would</text><text start="1644.91" dur="3.0">say one of the first things we want to</text><text start="1646.2" dur="5.55">do when we start to do sense making is</text><text start="1647.91" dur="6.69">to look at why is anyone sharing what</text><text start="1651.75" dur="5.41">they&apos;re sharing and not assuming that</text><text start="1654.6" dur="5.12">they are being truthful</text><text start="1657.16" dur="5.84">[Music]</text><text start="1659.72" dur="6.31">so basically truthful is about game</text><text start="1663.0" dur="4.47">theory right truthful is about the fact</text><text start="1666.03" dur="4.07">that people are lying all the time</text><text start="1667.47" dur="2.63">and</text><text start="1676.34" dur="4.809">okay we&apos;re actually gonna say a little</text><text start="1678.21" dur="4.65">bit more about that one formula when</text><text start="1681.149" dur="2.191">you&apos;re playing poker you learn how to</text><text start="1682.86" dur="3.75">bluff</text><text start="1683.34" dur="5.79">because it it&apos;s not who has the best</text><text start="1686.61" dur="4.409">hand that wins it&apos;s who makes everyone</text><text start="1689.13" dur="3.57">else think that they have the best hand</text><text start="1691.019" dur="5.13">and right there&apos;s there&apos;s a lot that</text><text start="1692.7" dur="6.449">goes on than that and so because it&apos;s a</text><text start="1696.149" dur="4.801">zero-sum game right that if my win does</text><text start="1699.149" dur="6.561">not equal your win my win is going to</text><text start="1700.95" dur="7.68">equal some other players losses then I</text><text start="1705.71" dur="5.589">have an incentive to dis inform you</text><text start="1708.63" dur="6.299">where information about reality is a</text><text start="1711.299" dur="5.01">source of competitive advantage this is</text><text start="1714.929" dur="2.49">actually the real kind of key way of</text><text start="1716.309" dur="2.58">thinking about because disinformation</text><text start="1717.419" dur="3.87">even happens in nature with other</text><text start="1718.889" dur="4.351">animals you&apos;ll see a caterpillar that</text><text start="1721.289" dur="3.841">evolved to have something on its tail</text><text start="1723.24" dur="3.39">that looks like a head to dis inform</text><text start="1725.13" dur="3.269">birds so that they go to pick up the</text><text start="1726.63" dur="3.24">false head and it might still be able to</text><text start="1728.399" dur="5.211">live right like that&apos;s actually an</text><text start="1729.87" dur="6.39">involved disinformation strategy and</text><text start="1733.61" dur="4.9">it&apos;s just that the disinformation in</text><text start="1736.26" dur="3.81">nature happens very slowly and where the</text><text start="1738.51" dur="3.389">selective pressures on the side of the</text><text start="1740.07" dur="3.719">caterpillar and the bird or coevolving</text><text start="1741.899" dur="3.571">right so the bird is getting better at</text><text start="1743.789" dur="2.88">noticing those things as the caterpillar</text><text start="1745.47" dur="3.03">is getting better at dealing with that</text><text start="1746.669" dur="4.14">camouflage is a kind of disinformation</text><text start="1748.5" dur="4.08">right it&apos;s an attempt to not signal</text><text start="1750.809" dur="5.761">something fully because there&apos;s rival</text><text start="1752.58" dur="7.92">risk dynamics between the caterpillar</text><text start="1756.57" dur="6.39">and the bird in that scenario but with</text><text start="1760.5" dur="5.34">people with our abstract replicators we</text><text start="1762.96" dur="4.89">can create the distortion much much much</text><text start="1765.84" dur="3.719">faster we can have a symmetries in the</text><text start="1767.85" dur="5.579">capacity to create the distortion and</text><text start="1769.559" dur="11.761">even exponential asymmetries and so it&apos;s</text><text start="1773.429" dur="10.051">actually really quite different so you</text><text start="1781.32" dur="3.78">think about the poker bluff and you</text><text start="1783.48" dur="3.329">think about like even in soccer or</text><text start="1785.1" dur="3.03">football when someone fakes left and</text><text start="1786.809" dur="5.191">then goes right that&apos;s a disinformation</text><text start="1788.13" dur="5.779">strategy where if we&apos;re competing in</text><text start="1792.0" dur="4.32">information about the nature of reality</text><text start="1793.909" dur="5.11">where the water is where the gold is</text><text start="1796.32" dur="4.02">what the market is going to do next if</text><text start="1799.019" dur="3.87">this company is going to make it</text><text start="1800.34" dur="4.5">whatever equals a source of advantage</text><text start="1802.889" dur="3.091">but we&apos;re an assumed rival risk dynamic</text><text start="1804.84" dur="2.25">we&apos;re competing for the same money</text><text start="1805.98" dur="3.6">competing for the same attention</text><text start="1807.09" dur="4.64">whatever then first I have</text><text start="1809.58" dur="5.37">the incentive to withhold information</text><text start="1811.73" dur="5.71">right so I don&apos;t want to tell you where</text><text start="1814.95" dur="4.65">the gold is or I don&apos;t want you to know</text><text start="1817.44" dur="5.79">the intellectual property that I&apos;m going</text><text

because I&apos;m doing cancer</text><text start="1826.649" dur="4.321">research and I&apos;ve had some big</text><text start="1829.44" dur="2.67">breakthroughs but I&apos;m not trying to</text><text

see how intractable this</text><text start="1845.22" dur="7.23">problem seems within a game theoretic</text><text start="1848.94" dur="5.64">environment like capitalism right I keep</text><text

is probably going to suggest</text><text start="1874.109" dur="7.2">something that doesn&apos;t work so the first</text><text start="1879.09" dur="6.24">thing is withholding information and

dur="7.37">the assessment that we&apos;ve done so we can</text><text start="2753.49" dur="6.63">get into at some depth the topic of</text><text start="2757.59" dur="6.55">appropriate epistemology for various</text><text start="2760.12" dur="6.03">contexts but the I guess the first thing</text><text start="2764.14" dur="5.67">I can say is that if people aren&apos;t even</text><text start="2766.15" dur="5.22">thinking about that their chance of</text><text start="2769.81" dur="8.16">making sense well is pretty close to</text><text start="2771.37" dur="10.74">zero if we think about the concept of a</text><text start="2777.97" dur="6.24">meme the way that Dawkins originally put</text><text start="2782.11" dur="3.48">it forward it&apos;s a abstract pattern</text><text start="2784.21" dur="3.48">replicator where a gene is an</text><text start="2785.59" dur="4.55">instantiated pattern replicator which</text><text start="2787.69" dur="5.88">means that it can mutate and change and</text><text start="2790.14" dur="7.18">affect behavior and propagate much much</text><text start="2793.57" dur="6.39">much faster right and we can kind of say</text><text start="2797.32" dur="4.77">that in Homo sapiens our genetics</text><text start="2799.96" dur="5.61">selected for memetics for higher-order</text><text start="2802.09" dur="7.68">mimetics right our genetics because most</text><text start="2805.57" dur="5.79">other species what the selective</text><text start="2809.77" dur="4.41">pressures had them be adaptive to an</text><text start="2811.36" dur="5.46">environment right they there&apos;s mutation</text><text start="2814.18" dur="3.93">and then the mutations that survive and</text><text start="2816.82" dur="3.75">make the best are the ones that make it</text><text start="2818.11" dur="4.8">through but that&apos;s within the context of</text><text start="2820.57" dur="3.87">survive in that environment and are able</text><text start="2822.91" dur="2.79">to mate successfully in that environment</text><text start="2824.44" dur="3.3">so they become more more fit to their</text><text start="2825.7" dur="3.93">environment so the

dur="2.99">able to go to every environment which</text><text start="2856.18" dur="3.69">means that as soon as our population</text><text start="2857.64" dur="2.96">would normally if we were any

dur="5.04">the next one right into all of them and</text><text start="2869.93" dur="3.48">then but that part isn&apos;t the part I want</text><text start="2872.75" dur="2.79">to get into it now</text><text start="2873.41" dur="4.38">it&apos;s that since we were gonna be</text><text start="2875.54" dur="4.05">adaptive to totally new environments and</text><text start="2877.79" dur="5.72">since we were gonna create tools where</text><text start="2879.59" dur="7.74">what it was to be adaptive was changing</text><text start="2883.51" dur="5.89">sin since we modify our environment in</text><text start="2887.33" dur="4.44">ways the other animals don&apos;t we can&apos;t</text><text start="2889.4" dur="4.14">come in genetically fit to a specific</text><text start="2891.77" dur="3.21">environment we have to come in and be</text><text start="2893.54" dur="2.94">able to imprint the environment that</text><text start="2894.98" dur="3.59">we&apos;re in so we know how to be fit two</text><text start="2896.48" dur="5.7">totally different environments cuz like</text><text start="2898.57" dur="5.95">it&apos;s not that adaptive for us to throw</text><text start="2902.18" dur="4.38">Spears or even climb trees all that well</text><text start="2904.52" dur="3.27">but it is to be able to like text and</text><text start="2906.56" dur="4.11">drive and stuff that wouldn&apos;t have been</text><text start="2907.79" dur="6.84">adaptive thousand years ago at all and</text><text start="2910.67" dur="6.93">so this is why human babies are</text><text start="2914.63" dur="5.13">embryonic or jnanis for so long right</text><text start="2917.6" dur="4.2">compared to any other animal if you like</text><text start="2919.76" dur="3.6">the thing I like to do here is to think</text><text start="2921.8" dur="4.14">about a horse standing up in like 20</text><text start="2923.36" dur="5.34">minutes and a human being able to walk</text><text start="2925.94" dur="4.92">in like a year and just think about how</text><text start="2928.7" dur="5.16">many 20 minute segments multiplied into</text><text start="2930.86" dur="4.89">a year to get a sense of how much longer</text><text start="2933.86" dur="4.14">we are helpless than anything else is</text><text start="2935.75" dur="4.29">and even amongst the other primates</text><text start="2938.0" dur="4.59">close to us is there&apos;s really nothing</text><text start="2940.04" dur="5.76">like us in terms of the extended</text><text start="2942.59" dur="5.19">helplessness and that&apos;s because we&apos;re we</text><text start="2945.8" dur="3.48">don&apos;t have inherited knowledge of how to</text><text start="2947.78" dur="2.76">be us since the environment is going to</text><text start="2949.28" dur="2.97">be different we have to imprint the</text><text start="2950.54" dur="3.06">environment that we&apos;re in to be able to</text><text start="2952.25" dur="9.74">be adaptive to environments that we&apos;re</text><text start="2953.6" dur="12.3">changing right so and so this is a</text><text start="2961.99" dur="5.92">saying that our genetics selected for</text><text start="2965.9" dur="3.78">neuroplasticity selected for memetics</text><text start="2967.91" dur="4.61">our hardware selected for faster</text><text start="2969.68" dur="6.03">software updates that could have faster</text><text start="2972.52" dur="4.93">changes in adaptive basis so that we</text><text start="2975.71" dur="6.78">could move our environments and all</text><text start="2977.45" dur="7.2">those types of things so if we think</text><text start="2982.49" dur="4.32">about a meat and kind of like a gene as</text><text start="2984.65" dur="3.84">an ax pattern replicator but as an</text><text start="2986.81" dur="4.59">abstract pattern replicator that can</text><text start="2988.49" dur="5.06">mutate much quicker there&apos;s also a big</text><text start="2991.4" dur="6.11">differences that the other animals are</text><text start="2993.55" dur="6.36">it in an environment the mutation across</text><text start="2997.51" dur="6.9">genes is very evenly distributed</text><text start="2999.91" dur="7.08">mutations happening to the gazelles and</text><text start="3004.41" dur="4.8">to the cheetahs at an equal rate right</text><text start="3006.99" dur="3.78">and there&apos;s Co selective pressures on</text><text start="3009.21" dur="3.27">both of them so they&apos;re both getting</text><text start="3010.77" dur="3.599">faster the slowest ones of each are</text><text start="3012.48" dur="4.26">dying off and so there&apos;s this kind of</text><text start="3014.369" dur="3.931">symmetry of power that has the</text><text start="3016.74" dur="4.47">competitive pressures between them have</text><text start="3018.3" dur="5.97">them all up level but when we start</text><text start="3021.21" dur="4.8">being mostly mimetic and the other</text><text start="3024.27" dur="3.3">species are still mostly genetic meaning</text><text start="3026.01" dur="3.27">we&apos;re largely based we&apos;re getting</text><text start="3027.57" dur="3.06">adaptive based on abstract pattern</text><text start="3029.28" dur="3.0">replicators are still in stan see a</text><text start="3030.63" dur="3.39">pattern replicators we can increase our</text><text start="3032.28" dur="3.63">per date of capacity much faster than</text><text start="3034.02" dur="3.72">they can increase their than the</text><text start="3035.91" dur="3.66">environment can increase its resilience</text><text start="3037.74" dur="4.11">to our creative capacity which means</text><text start="3039.57" dur="4.41">that we can debase the whole substrate</text><text start="3041.85" dur="3.66">that we depend upon which is self</text><text start="3043.98" dur="4.31">terminating right you can&apos;t keep</text><text start="3045.51" dur="5.94">debasing that which you depend upon so</text><text start="3048.29" dur="5.829">in evolution there is a selection</text><text start="3051.45" dur="7.68">process for the genes that make it</text><text start="3054.119" dur="6.901">through right but they there is this</text><text start="3059.13" dur="3.42">kind of symmetry of the genes that make</text><text start="3061.02" dur="4.2">it through because of the evenness of</text><text start="3062.55" dur="6.12">mutation and because of the co selective</text><text start="3065.22" dur="6.24">pressures now with mimetics the memes</text><text start="3068.67" dur="5.04">that make it through are the memes that</text><text start="3071.46" dur="4.08">win in a rival risk context not the ones</text><text start="3073.71" dur="3.03">that necessarily represents the true or</text><text start="3075.54" dur="3.99">the good or the beautiful so the</text><text start="3076.74" dur="4.95">propagated memes propagate more than the</text><text start="3079.53" dur="5.03">true memes propagate this is a super</text><text start="3081.69" dur="6.36">important concept to understand which is</text><text start="3084.56" dur="6.43">like I was always dumbfounded thinking</text><text start="3088.05" dur="4.35">about the evolution of religions take</text><text start="3090.99" dur="6.27">Christianity for instance and you say</text><text start="3092.4" dur="7.17">okay so Jesus when they brought Mary</text><text start="3097.26" dur="3.87">Magdalene said let he who has no</text><text start="3099.57" dur="3.33">sentence amongst you cast the first</text><text start="3101.13" dur="2.94">stone right and then when they&apos;re</text><text start="3102.9" dur="2.88">nailing him up he says Father forgive</text><text start="3104.07" dur="4.56">them for they know not what they they do</text><text start="3105.78" dur="5.85">and he&apos;s like bringing forgiveness to</text><text start="3108.63" dur="5.46">Judaism and in his name we did the</text><text start="3111.63" dur="4.71">Crusades in the Inquisition and said we</text><text start="3114.09" dur="5.19">will not just kill but torture anyone</text><text start="3116.34" dur="5.55">who doesn&apos;t accept the Lord of peace is</text><text start="3119.28" dur="4.92">there like how the [ __ ] did we do that</text><text start="3121.89" dur="5.64">how did we do the mental gymnastics</text><text start="3124.2" dur="4.859">to take the guy whose key teachings were</text><text start="3127.53" dur="3.15">forgiveness and torture people in the</text><text start="3129.059" dur="3.721">name of that well we figured out how to</text><text start="3130.68" dur="5.25">do it right but the key is that we was</text><text start="3132.78" dur="5.789">super adaptive so you you&apos;ve got an idea</text><text start="3135.93" dur="5.49">right say you&apos;ve got Jesus teachings or</text><text start="3138.569" dur="4.29">we can take it in any of them and then</text><text start="3141.42" dur="3.78">there&apos;s going to be a bunch of mutations</text><text start="3142.859" dur="8.341">on that idea different interpretations</text><text start="3145.2" dur="9.09">of it some of the mutations say be quiet</text><text start="3151.2" dur="6.81">and don&apos;t push your ideas on anyone like</text><text start="3154.29" dur="5.88">be contemplative and you know etc and</text><text start="3158.01" dur="3.9">those ones don&apos;t catch on because they</text><text start="3160.17" dur="4.56">aren&apos;t being intentionally propagated</text><text start="3161.91" dur="4.889">and other ones say go out and propagate</text><text start="3164.73" dur="4.859">these ideas on missions and on Crusades</text><text start="3166.799" dur="4.77">and focus on the not the forgiveness</text><text start="3169.589" dur="3.871">parts but on the like wrath and</text><text start="3171.569" dur="4.951">Leviticus and who God&apos;s enemies we&apos;re</text><text start="3173.46" dur="6.859">like focus on those parts and that you</text><text start="3176.52" dur="7.14">actually get better spots in heaven for</text><text start="3180.319" dur="5.171">converting more people right and and so</text><text start="3183.66" dur="3.57">what you end up getting is that the</text><text start="3185.49" dur="4.8">ideas that catch on are the ones that</text><text start="3187.23" dur="5.7">win and narrative warfare but they&apos;re</text><text start="3190.29" dur="3.9">having to catch on so then say Islam is</text><text start="3192.93" dur="3.81">also competing for some of the same</text><text start="3194.19" dur="5.669">people right because ultimately the</text><text start="3196.74" dur="4.829">religions become the basis of in groups</text><text start="3199.859" dur="4.771">that are competing against out groups</text><text start="3201.569" dur="6.061">for fundamentally political and economic</text><text start="3204.63" dur="6.239">and survival type basis so I can hold</text><text start="3207.63" dur="5.88">people together with a political left or</text><text start="3210.869" dur="4.651">political right ideology or a capitalist</text><text start="3213.51" dur="3.93">communist ideology or racial identity</text><text start="3215.52" dur="5.13">ideology or religious ideologies all of</text><text start="3217.44" dur="5.94">those become the basis of an in-group</text><text start="3220.65" dur="4.439">that can be that can bind together to be</text><text start="3223.38" dur="3.9">more successful in competition with</text><text start="3225.089" dur="3.99">assumed out groups right but what that</text><text start="3227.28" dur="4.35">means is that rival risk game theoretic</text><text start="3229.079" dur="4.651">environment is going to be selecting for</text><text start="3231.63" dur="5.939">what is effective at rivalry not what is</text><text start="3233.73" dur="5.52">true and and definitely not what is good</text><text start="3237.569" dur="3.3">for the whole and the moment that</text><text start="3239.25" dur="3.66">anybody figures something out that is</text><text start="3240.869" dur="4.021">more effective at rivalry than everybody</text><text start="3242.91" dur="4.08">else reverse engineers it and you know</text><text start="3244.89" dur="6.57">creates similar mimetic mutations on</text><text start="3246.99" dur="7.68">other sides and so there&apos;s not that many</text><text start="3251.46" dur="6.09">James right there they&apos;re lovely people</text><text start="3254.67" dur="4.38">right and totally nonviolent and</text><text start="3257.55" dur="3.0">aren&apos;t you know aren&apos;t gonna hurt</text><text start="3259.05" dur="2.97">anybody but

ideas</text><text start="3264.06" dur="5.12">that have an artificial focus on the</text><text start="3266.099" dur="4.891">spreading of ideas and figure out how to</text><text start="3269.18" dur="3.669">emotionally manipulate people into</text><text start="3270.99" dur="5.94">believing the idea with heaven and hell</text><text start="3272.849" dur="9.961">and whatever right are going to

dur="3.54">not just right I&apos;m giving the example of</text><text start="3287.52" dur="3.569">the teachings of Jesus turning into the</text><text start="3289.02" dur="6.03">Crusades or the

Darwin comes out in</text><text start="3385.05" dur="4.71">that context and so the idea of survival</text><text start="3387.81" dur="3.24">of the fittest is the idea we focus on</text><text

right and so there was</text><text start="3396.6" dur="7.16">again taking Darwin&apos;s idea in one</text><text start="3399.06" dur="6.75">context and then also taking the most</text><text start="3403.76" dur="5.91">propagated version of it that led to</text><text start="3405.81" dur="7.64">social Darwinism that basically reified</text><text start="3409.67" dur="6.34">institutional

have to actually call the herd</text><text start="3423.81" dur="6.24">sometimes like there and if you start to</text><text start="3426.75" dur="6.09">think about how hierarchical power</text><text start="3430.05" dur="4.65">structures work to get to the top of a</text><text start="3432.84" dur="3.83">hierarchical power structure like a big</text><text start="3434.7" dur="4.28">corporation or a

start="3440.76" dur="4.05">just say corporation or government I</text><text start="3442.2" dur="4.56">have to win at a lot of win-lose games I</text><text start="3444.81" dur="3.66">have to get the

it&apos;s actually going to so</text><text start="3457.98" dur="4.14">if I have a lot of empathy and I don&apos;t</text><text start="3460.32" dur="3.27">want and I actually care about

dur="3.48">I&apos;ll do better at so this is why we see</text><text start="3469.83" dur="4.23">higher percentage of sociopaths and</text><text start="3471.9" dur="5.37">Psychopaths as CEOs and in the normal</text><text start="3474.06" dur="4.41">distribution of population which also</text><text start="3477.27" dur="3.08">means that the people have the most</text><text start="3478.47" dur="5.48">influence in the world are</text><text start="3480.35" dur="7.3">asymmetrically empowered and</text><text start="3483.95" dur="7.39">asymmetrically sociopathic but the way</text><text start="3487.65" dur="5.94">that we interpreted Darwin was to was</text><text start="3491.34" dur="4.47">reifying that as a reasonable thing and</text><text start="3493.59" dur="4.41">even a good thing so we have to</text><text start="3495.81" dur="4.32">recognize that any idea even if it</text><text start="3498.0" dur="5.13">started as true or good or beautiful</text><text start="3500.13" dur="6.24">gets put into the game theoretic mill</text><text start="3503.13" dur="5.49">right and what comes what propagates is</text><text start="3506.37" dur="5.49">the thing that&apos;s propagated so why do</text><text start="3508.62" dur="8.31">bad ideas catch on like largely for this</text><text start="3511.86" dur="7.44">reason so oftentimes the best ideas are</text><text start="3516.93" dur="3.75">not well marketed and aren&apos;t even easily</text><text start="3519.3" dur="3.42">marketable and</text><text start="3520.68" dur="5.639">best marketed ideas that are gonna catch</text><text start="3522.72" dur="5.76">on the most are not that true and pretty</text><text start="3526.319" dur="3.901">shitty results so this is again</text><text start="3528.48" dur="5.43">something that people have to really pay</text><text start="3530.22" dur="4.95">attention to is I think Jordan in one of</text><text start="3533.91" dur="2.909">his interviews with you talked about the</text><text start="3535.17" dur="6.84">difference between real thinking and</text><text start="3536.819" dur="7.351">simulated thinking so if I&apos;m just taking</text><text start="3542.01" dur="4.74">memes that I&apos;ve heard I&apos;m in a</text><text start="3544.17" dur="5.31">conversation and I&apos;m listening for which</text><text start="3546.75" dur="4.47">of the things I&apos;m gonna say that I have</text><text start="3549.48" dur="5.43">heard somewhere else I&apos;m basically a</text><text start="3551.22" dur="5.399">meme propagator it&apos;s not real thinking</text><text start="3554.91" dur="3.36">right I&apos;m not actually endeavoring to</text><text start="3556.619" dur="5.071">try to make sense of the world in a new</text><text start="3558.27" dur="8.7">way that I&apos;ve never done before most</text><text start="3561.69" dur="9.57">people hear something here a meme that</text><text start="3566.97" dur="5.55">comes in and because it&apos;s from Fox they</text><text start="3571.26" dur="3.359">believe it or don&apos;t believe it or</text><text start="3572.52" dur="3.299">because it&apos;s from CNN or whatever it is</text><text start="3574.619" dur="3.631">they believe it or don&apos;t believe it so</text><text start="3575.819" dur="5.821">they basically have some cluster of</text><text start="3578.25" dur="5.819">memes that creates like a memetic immune</text><text start="3581.64" dur="3.929">system that says which idea is to accept</text><text start="3584.069" dur="3.831">and which one&apos;s to reject and then once</text><text start="3585.569" dur="6.151">it&apos;s accepted then propagates them</text><text start="3587.9" dur="7.81">that&apos;s not thinking and there&apos;s no</text><text start="3591.72" dur="7.17">sovereignty in that and groups that have</text><text start="3595.71" dur="5.79">asymmetric mean broadcast capacity are</text><text start="3598.89" dur="5.01">good at making memes that are sticky</text><text start="3601.5" dur="4.98">customized to specific audiences and</text><text start="3603.9" dur="4.889">being able to split test uptake right</text><text start="3606.48" dur="4.379">and then being able to you know then you</text><text start="3608.789" dur="3.391">get into high tech things like Facebook</text><text start="3610.859" dur="3.661">and it&apos;s like okay I can actually pay</text><text start="3612.18" dur="4.32">attention to what you click on and do</text><text start="3614.52" dur="3.48">profoundly deep analytics I can pay</text><text start="3616.5" dur="3.15">attention to mouse hover I can pay</text><text start="3618.0" dur="3.96">attention to all these types of</text><text start="3619.65" dur="6.03">analytics and customize the</text><text start="3621.96" dur="5.25">disinformation to everybody using the</text><text start="3625.68" dur="3.179">kind of AI that beats the best chess</text><text start="3627.21" dur="3.77">players in the world of chess right this</text><text start="3628.859" dur="6.631">is stuff that Tristan Harris talks about</text><text start="3630.98" dur="9.73">and so the AI that beats Kasparov at</text><text start="3635.49" dur="6.96">chess easily it&apos;ll nobody is as good at</text><text start="3640.71" dur="3.45">being strategic with themselves as</text><text start="3642.45" dur="3.329">Kasparov is a chess and we don&apos;t even</text><text start="3644.16" dur="3.24">know that we&apos;re engaged in that and yet</text><text start="3645.779" dur="3.721">it&apos;s competing with us for our attention</text><text start="3647.4" dur="4.709">for the its purpose of maximize time</text><text start="3649.5" dur="4.329">on-site now it just happens to be that</text><text start="3652.109" dur="3.67">I&apos;m gonna scroll and bounce unless</text><text start="3653.829" dur="3.39">than catches my attention short things</text><text start="3655.779" dur="2.151">will catch my attention more because I&apos;m</text><text start="3657.219" dur="3.931">in a hurry</text><text start="3657.93" dur="5.71">so just orientation for small bit size</text><text start="3661.15" dur="5.909">makes everyone more fundamentalists with</text><text start="3663.64" dur="5.369">shittier attention spans and then if the</text><text start="3667.059" dur="3.78">headline is more kind of sensational</text><text start="3669.009" dur="3.84">it&apos;s going to attract attention more so</text><text start="3670.839" dur="3.27">then we get these big platforms that</text><text start="3672.849" dur="3.51">don&apos;t want to make people</text><text start="3674.109" dur="5.071">fundamentalists or how to drive politics</text><text start="3676.359" dur="4.62">but they do simply as a byproduct of the</text><text start="3679.18" dur="3.539">fact that limbic hijacks are sticky and</text><text start="3680.979" dur="6.181">they&apos;re optimizing for time on sight</text><text start="3682.719" dur="7.82">so first thing is that individual memes</text><text start="3687.16" dur="6.149">don&apos;t get selected for mean memes</text><text start="3690.539" dur="6.25">interrelate with other memes to create</text><text start="3693.309" dur="6.45">world views because I usually can&apos;t make</text><text start="3696.789" dur="6.631">a choice based on a meet and I have to</text><text start="3699.759" dur="5.46">make a choice based on a representation</text><text start="3703.42" dur="3.51">of the world just going to be a bunch of</text><text start="3705.219" dur="4.471">ideas write a bunch of memes a bunch of</text><text start="3706.93" dur="6.599">data and so we get these kind of meme</text><text start="3709.69" dur="7.889">complexes and so we can think about the</text><text start="3713.529" dur="6.51">evolution of meme complexes so let&apos;s go</text><text start="3717.579" dur="6.321">ahead and look at like the evolution of</text><text start="3720.039" dur="9.03">religious ideas we can look at the</text><text start="3723.9" dur="9.939">evolution of political ideas or anything</text><text start="3729.069" dur="9.561">scientific ideas so religious ideas so</text><text start="3733.839" dur="7.23">you&apos;ll have some kind of central meme</text><text start="3738.63" dur="6.099">but then you&apos;ll also have protector</text><text start="3741.069" dur="6.21">memes that emerge with it that also</text><text start="3744.729" dur="4.35">believing them protects against the kind</text><text start="3747.279" dur="3.57">of cognitive processes that could have</text><text start="3749.079" dur="4.95">someone stop believing the primary mean</text><text start="3750.849" dur="4.92">because if the primary intent last so</text><text start="3754.029" dur="3.151">the question isn&apos;t just what makes a</text><text start="3755.769" dur="5.52">meme propagate but also what makes it</text><text start="3757.18" dur="7.95">endure and resist change so there&apos;s the</text><text start="3761.289" dur="5.82">evolution of memes but also they&apos;re the</text><text start="3765.13" dur="3.239">mean complexes resilience in the</text><text start="3767.109" dur="2.76">presence of other competing meme</text><text start="3768.369" dur="4.59">complexes right so we&apos;ll give these</text><text start="3769.869" dur="5.43">protector memes and then we&apos;ll also give</text><text start="3772.959" dur="4.32">propagator memes that are trying to take</text><text start="3775.299" dur="3.601">the whole complex and propagate it so</text><text start="3777.279" dur="3.54">there&apos;s there&apos;s a whole football team of</text><text start="3778.9" dur="3.99">defense and offense and carrying the</text><text start="3780.819" dur="3.341">ball and right like that happens so</text><text start="3782.89" dur="3.669">let&apos;s say we</text><text start="3784.16" dur="5.06">get some kind of fundamentalist religion</text><text start="3786.559" dur="5.461">so let&apos;s say we we look at Christianity</text><text start="3789.22" dur="5.92">this would be the same for any religion</text><text start="3792.02" dur="6.24">this just probably the one that most</text><text start="3795.14" dur="4.74">people here will relate to so you&apos;ll</text><text start="3798.26" dur="6.809">have some kind of central doctrinal</text><text start="3799.88" dur="7.53">teachings about Christ and God and what</text><text start="3805.069" dur="5.25">good is and those types of things but</text><text start="3807.41" dur="5.34">then protector memes are what could make</text><text start="3810.319" dur="5.49">me not believe these things and how do</text><text start="3812.75" dur="5.309">we protect against those processes so if</text><text start="3815.809" dur="6.931">we want to have say a literal</text><text start="3818.059" dur="7.411">interpretation then we don&apos;t want people</text><text start="3822.74" dur="5.9">to doubt the literal interpretation then</text><text start="3825.47" dur="8.19">we start to have things memes like faith</text><text start="3828.64" dur="7.27">is something God likes and doubt which</text><text start="3833.66" dur="3.659">is another term for critical thinking is</text><text start="3835.91" dur="2.85">something that God doesn&apos;t like it</text><text start="3837.319" dur="4.141">actually comes from the devil and you&apos;ll</text><text start="3838.76" dur="7.62">burn in hell for it and so the more that</text><text start="3841.46" dur="6.839">you just believe in the teaching the</text><text start="3846.38" dur="4.62">better your chances of heaven are and</text><text start="3848.299" dur="5.371">the more good you are and the more that</text><text start="3851.0" dur="5.039">you doubt it the more that Satan</text><text start="3853.67" dur="5.25">actually got to you right so that&apos;s a</text><text start="3856.039" dur="4.231">very strong protector meme against the</text><text start="3858.92" dur="2.879">kind of critical thinking that could</text><text start="3860.27" dur="5.579">make you question the basis of the</text><text start="3861.799" dur="8.641">religion you&apos;ll also have other</text><text start="3865.849" dur="6.51">protector memes like if I believe this</text><text start="3870.44" dur="3.149">if I continue to believe this I get to</text><text start="3872.359" dur="3.51">keep having a family and a community</text><text start="3873.589" dur="5.73">that will take care of me if I&apos;m poor</text><text start="3875.869" dur="5.16">and if I&apos;m sick and you know will help</text><text start="3879.319" dur="3.421">me out in times of warfare and all those</text><text start="3881.029" dur="4.02">things and if I stop everybody will</text><text start="3882.74" dur="4.89">disown me or to various degree is that</text><text start="3885.049" dur="5.191">like there will be direct implications</text><text start="3887.63" dur="4.26">to my life regarding the change in these</text><text start="3890.24" dur="3.21">beliefs and then again you&apos;ll have</text><text start="3891.89" dur="4.169">propagator memes we need to go on</text><text start="3893.45" dur="4.77">mission and share the good word with</text><text start="3896.059" dur="5.671">other people and convert them so you</text><text start="3898.22" dur="6.089">start to see a memetic ecosystem so now</text><text start="3901.73" dur="5.01">if I&apos;ve got propagator memes coming up</text><text start="3904.309" dur="4.861">against some some people who also have</text><text start="3906.74" dur="3.839">protector memes from a previous complex</text><text start="3909.17" dur="4.32">then there&apos;s an evolution there&apos;s a</text><text start="3910.579" dur="6.0">competition of which memes are more</text><text start="3913.49" dur="3.52">successful so then we look at the kind</text><text start="3916.579" dur="2.351">of</text><text start="3917.01" dur="3.45">illusion of the types of mean complexes</text><text start="3918.93" dur="3.54">over time now there other people have a</text><text start="3920.46" dur="5.43">lot more expertise in this than I do and</text><text start="3922.47" dur="4.71">I don&apos;t have adequately detailed history</text><text start="3925.89" dur="3.03">to say this is a Rea historical</text><text start="3927.18" dur="3.57">narrative it&apos;s an example of the type of</text><text start="3928.92" dur="7.44">thing that could happen right so ticket</text><text start="3930.75" dur="7.71">is that so say you look at the evolution</text><text start="3936.36" dur="9.15">of the concept of Hell right Hell as a</text><text start="3938.46"

dur="7.3">if you think about control systems right</text><text start="4039.59" dur="5.13">some few being able to control a mini in</text><text start="4042.5" dur="3.93">ways that are better for the

it</text><text start="4145.26" dur="4.46">has the hooks and I&apos;m much more afraid</text><text start="4146.34" dur="3.38">of that than I am of the Christian hell</text><text start="4150.32" dur="5.29">so we can see that you get an evolution</text><text start="4153.51" dur="5.61">of the gods getting more powerful and</text><text start="4155.61" dur="6.44">more authoritarian and more

better in many</text><text start="4780.73" dur="7.44">cases right it&apos;s not only story but thus</text><text start="4783.219" dur="6.601">a story and so then my goal is to</text><text start="4788.17" dur="3.81">actually invest in someone else&apos;s</text><text start="4789.82" dur="4.199">ability to generate a distortion bubble</text><text start="4791.98" dur="4.969">that will pull

dur="10.84">simulated realities is the whole goal</text><text start="4815.1" dur="8.53">and so a lot of people her it&apos;s another</text><text start="4822.04" dur="5.52">thing we have to pay attention to is</text><text start="4823.63" dur="7.02">that the cognitive complexity of a lot</text><text start="4827.56" dur="5.49">of the issues we face is just much</text><text start="4830.65" dur="4.47">faster than most people have time for</text><text start="4833.05" dur="5.06">then most people have training for and</text><text start="4835.12" dur="6.06">even vaster than we evolved to process</text><text start="4838.11" dur="6.94">so this idea of hyper objects right that</text><text start="4841.18" dur="5.91">there&apos;s not just plutonium but all of</text><text start="4845.05" dur="3.96">the plutonium or all of climate change</text><text start="4847.09" dur="3.48">or all of species extinction or whatever</text><text start="4849.01" dur="3.27">I can&apos;t actually observe that directly</text><text start="4850.57" dur="6.3">but I can infer it know that it&apos;s a real</text><text start="4852.28" dur="6.96">thing but how do I hold the cognitive</text><text start="4856.87" dur="4.8">complexity of any of those let alone all</text><text start="4859.24" dur="5.04">of them right as it is a very tricky</text><text start="4861.67" dur="3.96">thing and but I still have to feed my</text><text start="4864.28" dur="4.44">kids and pay the bills tomorrow</text><text start="4865.63" dur="5.34">and so the adaptive pressures on me are</text><text start="4868.72" dur="5.06">to focus on what I need to focus on in</text><text start="4870.97" dur="5.01">the very small and in the short term</text><text start="4873.78" dur="5.83">even though what I&apos;m doing because of</text><text start="4875.98" dur="6.06">globalized supply chains is affecting</text><text start="4879.61" dur="4.65">the global in the long term the idea</text><text start="4882.04" dur="3.36">think globally act locally most of us</text><text start="4884.26" dur="2.55">are doing the opposite right we&apos;re</text><text start="4885.4" dur="2.7">actually thinking very locally about</text><text start="4886.81" dur="3.45">having actions that affect the world</text><text start="4888.1" dur="4.8">globally which means we&apos;re we&apos;re</text><text start="4890.26" dur="5.01">thinking on very short timescales fairly</text><text start="4892.9" dur="4.95">narcissistic self-indulgent and you know</text><text start="4895.27" dur="5.19">timescales but with things that will</text><text start="4897.85" dur="6.48">have enduring and massive impact and</text><text start="4900.46" dur="5.37">that is a decoupling of scale it&apos;s a</text><text start="4904.33" dur="4.08">decoupling of sense making and choice</text><text start="4905.83" dur="4.56">making a bunch of things but so for most</text><text start="4908.41" dur="3.78">people the idea of having the luxury of</text><text start="4910.39" dur="2.94">trying to make sense of the world is</text><text start="4912.19" dur="2.67">something they don&apos;t even feel like they</text><text start="4913.33" dur="3.75">have because they&apos;re nose-down just</text><text start="4914.86" dur="5.43">trying to like do the next couple things</text><text start="4917.08" dur="5.27">they have to do and then other people</text><text start="4920.29" dur="4.08">who are actually trying to get ahead are</text><text start="4922.35" dur="4.12">optimizing for simulations and</text><text start="4924.37" dur="3.72">distortion bubbles rather than trying to</text><text start="4926.47" dur="2.64">make sense of the world so there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="4928.09" dur="6.05">of people who aren&apos;t actually even</text><text start="4929.11" dur="5.03">trying to make sense of the world now</text><text start="4936.1" dur="5.28">when I ask what is meaningful what is</text><text start="4939.25" dur="5.91">meaningful is going to be bound to what</text><text start="4941.38" dur="7.56">I think is real and if I give up on</text><text start="4945.16" dur="8.73">knowing what is real there&apos;s a way in</text><text start="4948.94" dur="7.17">which I&apos;m giving up on the depth of my</text><text start="4953.89" dur="4.65">connectedness to what&apos;s meaningful so</text><text start="4956.11" dur="4.5">yes giving up on sense making there&apos;s a</text><text start="4958.54" dur="4.26">is kind of an expression of a type of</text><text start="4960.61" dur="8.73">nihilism and it and it feeds into</text><text start="4962.8" dur="8.19">further nihilism first thing is I stop</text><text start="4969.34" dur="4.74">trying to squish reality into a</text><text start="4970.99" dur="5.76">perspective this is super important and</text><text start="4974.08" dur="5.43">then anytime I have a perspective and I</text><text start="4976.75" dur="5.04">am defaulting into thinking of it as the</text><text start="4979.51" dur="5.58">truth I become dubious of that in myself</text><text start="4981.79" dur="4.59">and they become curious about the</text><text start="4985.09" dur="3.03">partial truth in other people&apos;s</text><text start="4986.38" dur="4.47">perspectives including the ones that I</text><text start="4988.12" dur="6.42">think are stupid and crazy right because</text><text start="4990.85" dur="5.64">they none of them have no signal even if</text><text start="4994.54" dur="3.42">I think there&apos;s a lot of noise so I want</text><text start="4996.49" dur="3.18">to say why do they think it is true well</text><text start="4997.96" dur="4.02">this bias that bias okayed all that and</text><text start="4999.67" dur="4.47">some perception mixed with the bias what</text><text start="5001.98" dur="5.37">is the per what are they perceiving that</text><text start="5004.14" dur="4.86">then with the bias is also there maybe</text><text start="5007.35" dur="6.3">it&apos;s not that much sense making but it&apos;s</text><text start="5009.0" dur="6.63">something that&apos;s meaningful right so</text><text start="5013.65" dur="3.36">this is st. Francis&apos;s quote of seek more</text><text start="5015.63" dur="5.04">to understand them to be understood</text><text start="5017.01" dur="5.49">right seek first to understand that</text><text start="5020.67" dur="4.41">means actually seek to take different</text><text start="5022.5" dur="5.79">perspectives so the Hegelian dialectic</text><text start="5025.08" dur="4.89">is you&apos;ve got a thesis and then the</text><text start="5028.29" dur="4.2">antithesis I actually want to try and</text><text start="5029.97" dur="6.27">take this perspective and construct this</text><text start="5032.49" dur="6.96">case and once I&apos;ve constructed both of</text><text start="5036.24" dur="8.22">these now I&apos;m stuck with either that I</text><text start="5039.45" dur="8.76">flip-flop between them or I&apos;m just</text><text start="5044.46" dur="6.66">confused or I just claim paradox or the</text><text start="5048.21" dur="4.8">next step is thesis antithesis synthesis</text><text start="5051.12" dur="4.53">there&apos;s a higher-order truth it is</text><text start="5053.01" dur="4.47">actually not paradoxical that reconciles</text><text start="5055.65" dur="3.75">them it just requires a higher order of</text><text start="5057.48" dur="4.29">complexity it&apos;s paradoxical within too</text><text start="5059.4" dur="3.54">low a level of complexity Einsteins you</text><text start="5061.77" dur="3.32">can&apos;t solve a problem at the level of</text><text start="5062.94" dur="5.14">problem at the level of complexity and</text><text start="5065.09" dur="5.24">so since to how</text><text start="5068.08" dur="3.99">is three-dimensional no two-dimensional</text><text start="5070.33" dur="3.75">picture will actually give me a solid</text><text start="5072.07" dur="4.08">sense on it if I&apos;m looking at the</text><text start="5074.08" dur="5.01">cylinder we talked about this the other</text><text start="5076.15" dur="4.65">night if I&apos;m trying to collapse the</text><text start="5079.09" dur="3.06">cylinder by a dimension and take a</text><text start="5080.8" dur="3.72">cylinder which is a three dimensional</text><text start="5082.15" dur="3.87">object and take a 2d slice of it if I</text><text start="5084.52" dur="3.21">got a cylinder like this a slice like</text><text start="5086.02" dur="4.17">this is a circle a slice like this is a</text><text start="5087.73" dur="4.32">rectangle in 2d circle and rectangle are</text><text start="5090.19" dur="5.19">mutually exclusive descriptions of a</text><text start="5092.05" dur="4.83">shape one has straight lines and corners</text><text start="5095.38" dur="4.7">the other has no straight lines and no</text><text start="5096.88" dur="6.93">corners if I try to say well it&apos;s both</text><text start="5100.08" dur="6.55">that just makes no sense at all right if</text><text start="5103.81" dur="4.92">I say well it must be part of both so</text><text start="5106.63" dur="4.14">it&apos;s a rounded rectangle well that it</text><text start="5108.73" dur="3.93">has no truth at all but I have to</text><text start="5110.77" dur="4.68">actually be able to construct a higher</text><text start="5112.66" dur="4.77">dimensional space in which rectangle</text><text start="5115.45" dur="3.63">nough sand circle misfit together in a</text><text start="5117.43" dur="5.01">way that is makes perfect sense called</text><text start="5119.08" dur="4.74">it cylinder but this is what a level of</text><text start="5122.44" dur="3.65">consciousness that isn&apos;t the level that</text><text start="5123.82" dur="5.1">caused the problem the problem is</text><text start="5126.09" dur="4.96">partiality of perspective that can</text><text start="5128.92" dur="5.43">create then a basis for conflict right</text><text start="5131.05" dur="6.21">so then there is a higher order that is</text><text start="5134.35" dur="5.4">able to reconcile those and so seeking</text><text start="5137.26" dur="5.46">that and this is where you know we&apos;re</text><text start="5139.75" dur="4.5">seeking clarity more than simplicity</text><text start="5142.72" dur="8.39">because the simplicity can happen</text><text start="5144.25" dur="10.71">through reduction right and typically</text><text start="5151.11" dur="5.53">the synthesis comes from novel insight</text><text start="5154.96" dur="3.33">that neither the thesis nor the</text><text start="5156.64" dur="5.73">antithesis held it&apos;s not just well it&apos;s</text><text start="5158.29" dur="6.18">a little bit of both so a couple</text><text start="5162.37" dur="4.41">examples let&apos;s say we take kind of</text><text start="5164.47" dur="3.93">political left and political radiology</text><text start="5166.78" dur="3.03">there&apos;s a gazillion examples and what we</text><text start="5168.4" dur="3.0">call the political left and right today</text><text start="5169.81" dur="6.29">might seem actually quite different than</text><text start="5171.4" dur="8.01">what it was in the past so let&apos;s take a</text><text start="5176.1" dur="6.16">kind of what had previous to recently</text><text start="5179.41" dur="5.73">been kind of some essential ideas and</text><text start="5182.26" dur="4.37">Republican or Democrat platforms so we</text><text start="5185.14" dur="5.34">kind of have this Republican right</text><text start="5186.63" dur="6.37">oriented idea of wanting to empower the</text><text start="5190.48" dur="6.3">self responsibility and sovereignty of</text><text start="5193.0" dur="6.36">the individual and more individualistic</text><text start="5196.78" dur="4.53">and so smaller

pull themselves up by their</text><text start="5202.96" dur="6.2">bootstraps and you know that kind of</text><text start="5205.36" dur="6.87">thing and then you have the kind of more</text><text start="5209.16" dur="5.53">democratic left perspective that says</text><text start="5212.23" dur="4.2">well and here it&apos;s saying the collective</text><text start="5214.69" dur="3.6">is actually created by the individual so</text><text start="5216.43" dur="3.69">we want to empower the individuals that</text><text start="5218.29" dur="3.03">are creative and take agency because</text><text start="5220.12" dur="3.57">better individuals make a better whole</text><text start="5221.32" dur="4.23">that&apos;s kind of the gist over here it&apos;s</text><text start="5223.69" dur="3.45">like well but the individuals are being</text><text start="5225.55" dur="3.12">conditioned by the environment that</text><text start="5227.14" dur="3.75">they&apos;re born into by the whole and so</text><text start="5228.67" dur="3.75">even though I can&apos;t find that one story</text><text start="5230.89" dur="2.94">of that one guy who pulled themselves up</text><text start="5232.42" dur="2.76">by the bootstraps in the ghetto there&apos;s</text><text start="5233.83" dur="2.85">a whole lot more people that succeeded</text><text start="5235.18" dur="4.74">who were born into the

start="5241.57" dur="3.15">condition better people because there&apos;s</text><text start="5243.13" dur="5.75">top-down effects the holes create</text><text start="5244.72" dur="8.15">affecting the individuals so there&apos;s</text><text start="5248.88" dur="7.68">there&apos;s for many people some seemingly</text><text start="5252.87" dur="8.8">compelling truth in both of these and</text><text start="5256.56" dur="8.56">also problems right so there can be a</text><text start="5261.67" dur="5.64">right oriented perspective that says hey</text><text start="5265.12" dur="3.54">look if we set up social services in</text><text start="5267.31" dur="5.25">welfare and whatever we actually</text><text start="5268.66" dur="5.76">condition shittier people who are less</text><text start="5272.56" dur="4.05">strong and resilient in the face of the</text><text start="5274.42" dur="4.35">environment we D incentivize those who</text><text start="5276.61" dur="5.82">are most entrepreneur and

dur="2.76">theory here&apos;s things that we know from</text><text start="5964.68" dur="4.83">evolution is here here&apos;s how you can</text><text start="5965.85" dur="5.25">apply this as an epistemic tool or Eric</text><text start="5969.51" dur="3.09">could talk about here our principles in</text><text start="5971.1" dur="3.36">the philosophy of science and in physics</text><text start="5972.6" dur="5.82">that are valuable tools in understanding</text><text start="5974.46" dur="7.14">reality those types of things and then</text><text start="5978.42" dur="6.75">if they were even not that many people</text><text start="5981.6" dur="5.55">who started to really think about break</text><text start="5985.17" dur="3.75">downs and information ecology better and</text><text start="5987.15" dur="4.23">write on that more and those ideas were</text><text start="5988.92" dur="8.76">able to start to become better</text><text start="5991.38" dur="9.9">understood and be happy about that well</text><text start="5997.68" dur="6.38">if we look at the framework of sharing</text><text start="6001.28" dur="6.87">things that are truthful true and</text><text start="6004.06" dur="6.7">representative we start with the</text><text start="6008.15" dur="8.49">truthful side we would need to remove</text><text start="6010.76" dur="8.91">the incentive for disinformation and the</text><text start="6016.64" dur="7.59">first major source there is kind of</text><text start="6019.67" dur="6.36">market it&apos;s the game theoretic dynamics</text><text start="6024.23" dur="7.08">that emerge from market type dynamics</text><text start="6026.03" dur="7.83">and so again if I have two different</text><text start="6031.31" dur="5.1">branches of the government competing for</text><text start="6033.86" dur="5.49">budget or different representatives who</text><text start="6036.41" dur="5.79">are supposedly both seeking to be in</text><text start="6039.35" dur="4.47">benefit of the country competing for</text><text start="6042.2" dur="5.4">percentage of the budget now they have</text><text start="6043.82" dur="5.34">the incentive to dis inform whoever&apos;s</text><text start="6047.6" dur="4.38">allocating the budget dis inform the</text><text start="6049.16" dur="4.17">public dissin form each other which</text><text start="6051.98" dur="3.81">means that the total level of</text><text start="6053.33" dur="4.41">coordination just sucks right and this</text><text start="6055.79" dur="4.14">happens this is corporate politics</text><text start="6057.74" dur="4.86">inside of corporations this happens</text><text start="6059.93" dur="4.8">everywhere so as long as we have</text><text start="6062.6" dur="4.11">separate balance sheets right as long as</text><text start="6064.73" dur="4.62">the different intelligence agencies are</text><text start="6066.71" dur="4.89">competing for that as long as as people</text><text start="6069.35" dur="4.41">we have several balance sheets then we</text><text start="6071.6" dur="4.76">have a fundamental basis that my</text><text start="6073.76" dur="5.1">well-being is separable from and</text><text start="6076.36" dur="5.17">oftentimes directly rivalries with yours</text><text start="6078.86" dur="5.58">and with others and with the Commons so</text><text start="6081.53" dur="5.84">then we will compete with each other for</text><text start="6084.44" dur="7.95">a lot of things</text><text start="6087.37" dur="6.97">and we will engage in in at the worst</text><text start="6092.39" dur="3.42">case physical warfare kinetic warfare</text><text start="6094.34" dur="3.3">but will mostly engage in economic</text><text start="6095.81" dur="3.53">warfare competing against each other and</text><text start="6097.64" dur="3.81">at the cost of the Commons and</text><text start="6099.34" dur="3.46">information and narrative warfare also</text><text start="6101.45" dur="4.86">at the cost of the information Commons</text><text start="6102.8" dur="7.169">and each other so to really get over</text><text start="6106.31" dur="5.67">that we would need to couple or we need</text><text start="6109.969" dur="5.671">to create alignment between agencies</text><text start="6111.98" dur="5.85">right between what you have intention to</text><text start="6115.64" dur="3.57">do and what is also in my well-being and</text><text start="6117.83" dur="3.389">vice versa which means that we would</text><text start="6119.21" dur="3.72">need to have more coupling between our</text><text start="6121.219" dur="3.451">well-beings which means we would need to</text><text start="6122.93" dur="9.93">have a different process of resource</text><text start="6124.67" dur="9.75">provisioning and I will say that the the</text><text start="6132.86" dur="5.25">type of system that could do that</text><text start="6134.42" dur="7.52">adequately has never been proposed in</text><text start="6138.11" dur="6.48">any kind of major way because obviously</text><text start="6141.94" dur="7.81">none of the systems ever proposed so far</text><text start="6144.59" dur="6.69">or tried do that but if we have a rival</text><text start="6149.75" dur="3.33">risk relationship with each other</text><text start="6151.28" dur="3.36">information will be part of that rivalry</text><text start="6153.08" dur="3.3">and will damage the information ecology</text><text start="6154.64" dur="3.78">in the same way we damage the physical</text><text start="6156.38" dur="6.93">environment or or each other</text><text start="6158.42" dur="9.99">kinetically so that&apos;s a big ask</text><text start="6163.31" dur="8.4">right so our balance sheets are kind of</text><text start="6168.41" dur="5.309">at the foundation of what create</text><text start="6171.71" dur="3.81">rivalries dynamics and this is at the</text><text start="6173.719" dur="3.391">level of corporations at the level of</text><text start="6175.52" dur="4.949">individuals where it grounds above the</text><text start="6177.11" dur="5.19">families of the level of nations so can</text><text start="6180.469" dur="3.75">we still have private nation states that</text><text start="6182.3" dur="4.71">could benefit each other at the expense</text><text start="6184.219" dur="6.721">of others or Commons that share</text><text start="6187.01" dur="4.89">information perfectly so like if we</text><text start="6190.94" dur="2.79">really want to say how do we have a</text><text start="6191.9" dur="4.14">perfectly intact global information</text><text start="6193.73" dur="4.05">ecology it couldn&apos;t happen within the</text><text start="6196.04" dur="3.84">context of nation states and private</text><text start="6197.78" dur="3.689">balance sheets and political left&apos;s and</text><text start="6199.88" dur="6.21">rights and in-group out-group type</text><text start="6201.469" dur="7.261">structures it would take us a while to</text><text start="6206.09" dur="4.44">talk about what something post game</text><text start="6208.73" dur="4.23">theoretic might look like but if you</text><text start="6210.53" dur="6.12">want to just start to intuit it you say</text><text start="6212.96" dur="6.09">well if we look at all of the neurons in</text><text start="6216.65" dur="3.46">your brain or all of the cells in your</text><text start="6219.05" dur="3.61">body</text><text start="6220.11" dur="4.29">they&apos;re all their own agents right like</text><text start="6222.66" dur="2.76">the cell self-organizes and I can take</text><text start="6224.4" dur="3.15">it out of you and put in a be</text><text start="6225.42" dur="4.86">traditional keep self-organizing for</text><text start="6227.55" dur="5.49">period controlled by its own internal</text><text start="6230.28" dur="4.53">genetic code but even it&apos;s your body</text><text start="6233.04" dur="4.02">something like 70 trillion individual</text><text start="6234.81" dur="3.72">cells those cells are organizing in a</text><text start="6237.06" dur="2.88">way that&apos;s best for them as individuals</text><text start="6238.53" dur="2.91">and best for the ones around them and</text><text start="6239.94" dur="3.15">best for the whole simultaneously than</text><text start="6241.44" dur="4.38">either sacrificing themselves for the</text><text start="6243.09" dur="5.34">whole nor they sacrificing others for a</text><text start="6245.82" dur="4.08">game theoretic benefit and this is true</text><text start="6248.43" dur="3.09">at the level of cell to cell interaction</text><text start="6249.9" dur="3.27">but it&apos;s also a trickle of organ to</text><text start="6251.52" dur="3.96">organ interaction or organ system to</text><text start="6253.17" dur="5.57">organ system or cell to organ right like</text><text start="6255.48" dur="6.03">it fractally in all these levels</text><text start="6258.74" dur="7.09">vertical and horizontal there is a kind</text><text start="6261.51" dur="6.51">of symbiotic process that happens and if</text><text start="6265.83" dur="3.66">you tried to model like the organs and a</text><text start="6268.02" dur="3.81">capitalist relationship with each other</text><text start="6269.49" dur="3.87">where they were trying to the heart and</text><text start="6271.83" dur="4.08">the lungs were competing against each</text><text start="6273.36" dur="4.71">other for scarce resource to hoard as</text><text start="6275.91" dur="4.62">much resource for feature as possible</text><text start="6278.07" dur="4.23">and you model that out and happening at</text><text start="6280.53" dur="4.41">the cellular level buddy dies very</text><text start="6282.3" dur="6.27">quickly cancer cells are actually doing</text><text start="6284.94" dur="5.61">that right a cancer cell is doing what</text><text start="6288.57" dur="3.6">is good for it in the near term but bad</text><text start="6290.55" dur="2.82">for the whole and it will end up killing</text><text start="6292.17" dur="6.45">the whole and killing itself in the</text><text start="6293.37" dur="7.14">process and but the cancer cell only</text><text start="6298.62" dur="6.98">happened because the body as a whole had</text><text start="6300.51" dur="9.6">some Mis health that had carcinogenesis</text><text start="6305.6" dur="5.95">exceed the immune response capacity to</text><text start="6310.11" dur="2.91">deal with the carcinogenesis so the</text><text start="6311.55" dur="2.88">whole was already sick to make the</text><text start="6313.02" dur="2.55">individual sick to some degree right</text><text start="6314.43" dur="5.12">there&apos;s a feedback and feed-forward</text><text start="6315.57" dur="10.11">process between the parts and the whole</text><text start="6319.55" dur="9.82">if you think about like vision and the</text><text start="6325.68" dur="6.06">way that parallax error correction and</text><text start="6329.37" dur="4.71">parallax occurs in vision one eye</text><text start="6331.74" dur="4.89">doesn&apos;t give me peripheral vision and it</text><text start="6334.08" dur="4.86">doesn&apos;t give me depth perception two</text><text start="6336.63" dur="4.62">eyes together give me something that and</text><text start="6338.94" dur="4.05">also the single I will have errors that</text><text start="6341.25" dur="5.67">aren&apos;t corrected for the two eyes</text><text start="6342.99" dur="5.97">together the overlap of what they both</text><text start="6346.92" dur="3.3">see but also the difference of what one</text><text start="6348.96" dur="3.72">sees and the other one doesn&apos;t allows</text><text start="6350.22" dur="3.019">any error in this eye to be corrected</text><text start="6352.68" dur="2.69">for</text><text start="6353.239" dur="3.511">Aaron this I and it allows peripheral</text><text start="6355.37" dur="2.94">vision and depth perception so this is a</text><text start="6356.75" dur="3.54">place where not only are the eyes not in</text><text start="6358.31" dur="5.49">competition for which one is seen as</text><text start="6360.29" dur="5.97">true but the process of how they&apos;re</text><text start="6363.8" dur="4.8">related in the optical cortex gives me</text><text start="6366.26" dur="4.68">error correction on the on the</text><text start="6368.6" dur="3.99">imperfections in each of them and it</text><text start="6370.94" dur="2.85">gives me new synergistic information</text><text start="6372.59" dur="3.66">that neither of them had on their own</text><text start="6373.79" dur="5.13">that&apos;s [ __ ] amazing to think about</text><text start="6376.25" dur="4.62">right and this is true like your brain</text><text start="6378.92" dur="3.9">is a whole processes information that no</text><text start="6380.87" dur="3.599">individual of the types that no</text><text start="6382.82" dur="4.35">individual neuron or sub neural networks</text><text start="6384.469" dur="4.981">are processing and individual neurons</text><text start="6387.17" dur="3.69">can get something wrong but there&apos;s</text><text start="6389.45" dur="4.56">error correcting processes that don&apos;t</text><text start="6390.86" dur="4.83">propagate that but but the processes do</text><text start="6394.01" dur="3.9">propagate the true information so we&apos;re</text><text start="6395.69" dur="5.4">like well how the [ __ ] does it work that</text><text start="6397.91" dur="5.16">we get that the information processing</text><text start="6401.09" dur="5.01">that each of the parts are doing goes</text><text start="6403.07" dur="6.72">through a communication protocol that</text><text start="6406.1" dur="5.91">error corrects the false parts and also</text><text start="6409.79" dur="3.63">gives parallax on the true parts where</text><text start="6412.01" dur="3.45">we get not only the truth of all the</text><text start="6413.42" dur="3.36">parts but a way of binding that together</text><text start="6415.46" dur="6.63">for synergistically higher-order</text><text start="6416.78" dur="7.17">information the cells our sense making</text><text start="6422.09" dur="3.03">and they&apos;re communicating they&apos;re</text><text start="6423.95" dur="2.88">signaling with each other right a</text><text start="6425.12" dur="3.51">hormone is a communication a</text><text start="6426.83" dur="3.87">neurotransmitter like those are all</text><text start="6428.63" dur="3.51">signaling processes but they don&apos;t have</text><text start="6430.7" dur="3.36">a game theoretic relationship with each</text><text start="6432.14" dur="4.2">other right they actually have a</text><text start="6434.06" dur="4.74">mutually symbiotic relationship with</text><text start="6436.34" dur="4.74">each other so they are supporting each</text><text start="6438.8" dur="4.02">other sense making in that way they&apos;re</text><text start="6441.08" dur="3.36">the lungs obviously do better if the</text><text start="6442.82" dur="3.56">heart&apos;s doing better as opposed to doing</text><text start="6444.44" dur="4.68">worse if they the heart is doing better</text><text start="6446.38" dur="4.89">so if we just start to kind of imagine</text><text start="6449.12" dur="4.65">into what type of communication</text><text start="6451.27" dur="7.39">processes protocols would have to happen</text><text start="6453.77" dur="6.9">between humans that allowed for error</text><text start="6458.66" dur="5.28">correction on any
