<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.221" dur="0.87">- [Zubin] Hey guys, Dr. Z.</text><text start="1.091" dur="2.155">Welcome to &quot;The ZDoggMD Show.&quot;</text><text start="3.246" dur="1.132">Today, I have a guest I&apos;ve been wanting</text><text start="4.378" dur="1.343">to get on forever and ever and ever.</text><text start="5.721" dur="3.159">You guys know I&apos;m really
interested in the social dilemma,</text><text start="8.88" dur="2.001">in other words, the
effect that social media</text><text start="10.881" dur="2.023">and these exponential crazy technologies</text><text start="12.904" dur="3.78">that hack our dopamine
centers have had on us,</text><text start="16.684" dur="1.858">the mental health of children, and so on.</text><text start="18.542" dur="3.805">A lot of my knowledge on that
comes from our guest today,</text><text start="22.347" dur="1.409">and his partner, Tristan Harris,</text><text start="23.756" dur="3.973">who runs the Center for Humane Technology.</text><text start="27.729" dur="2.636">Daniel Schmachtenberger is the founder</text><text start="30.365" dur="2.634">and director of The Consilience Project,</text><text start="32.999" dur="4.242">and he is an expert in the (laughs),</text><text start="37.241" dur="3.377">the catastrophes that
can end civilizations,</text><text start="40.618" dur="3.419">and how we might thread that
narrow needle to avoid them.</text><text start="44.037" dur="1.784">Daniel, man, welcome to the show.</text><text start="45.821" dur="1.231">- [Daniel] It&apos;s good to
be here with you, man.</text><text start="47.052" dur="1.512">Happy that we&apos;re finally here.</text><text start="48.564" dur="2.338">- [Zubin] Dude, I just saw
you on Rogan with Tristan,</text><text start="50.902" dur="2.898">and I was like, &quot;Oh, man,
they&apos;re hitting all the buttons</text><text start="53.8" dur="2.399">&quot;on civilization-level threats,&quot;</text><text start="56.199" dur="1.793">and then I thought, &quot;Well,
what are we gonna talk about</text><text start="57.992" dur="0.886">&quot;when you come on my show?&quot;</text><text start="58.878" dur="1.578">&apos;Cause you just were on Rogan.</text><text start="60.456" dur="0.959">You&apos;ve been on Lex Fridman.</text><text start="61.415" dur="1.59">You&apos;ve been all over the place.</text><text start="63.005" dur="2.149">And then we started
talking before the show,</text><text start="65.154" dur="1.166">and immediately, I was like,</text><text start="66.32" dur="2.684">&quot;Oh my God, this is a
conversation no one&apos;s having,&quot;</text><text start="69.004" dur="2.394">and it&apos;s a, let&apos;s start it this way.</text><text start="71.398" dur="3.333">We have these God-level technologies now</text><text start="76.579" dur="2.108">that really prey,</text><text start="78.687" dur="1.718">and I&apos;m talking about
social media in particular,</text><text start="80.405" dur="1.687">but there&apos;s other
technologies that really prey</text><text start="82.092" dur="1.75">on our innate brain&apos;s</text><text start="87.439" dur="1.528">addictive capacity,</text><text start="88.967" dur="4.858">and really hacks it in ways
that are affecting our health</text><text start="93.825" dur="4.021">not just individually, but the
health of our entire society.</text><text start="97.846" dur="1.448">Maybe that&apos;s a good starting point</text><text start="99.294" dur="1.933">for jumping into what
you&apos;re passionate about,</text><text start="101.227" dur="1.956">because this is stuff that
you&apos;ve dedicated your life</text><text start="103.183" dur="4.167">to kind of studying, how
we can avoid catastrophe.</text><text start="109.044" dur="1.903">- [Daniel] Okay, so you say godlike tech,</text><text start="110.947" dur="3.271">and if it&apos;s not obvious for people,</text><text start="114.218" dur="1.296">so that it doesn&apos;t sound like hyperbole,</text><text start="115.514" dur="5.0">maybe we just take a moment,
and say what we mean by that.</text><text start="120.867" dur="2.172">When we have the ability
to do synthetic biology,</text><text start="123.039" dur="1.184">like actually make life,</text><text start="124.223" dur="2.103">and the ability for genetic engineering,</text><text start="126.326" dur="2.063">CRISPR, other methods,
to be able to change</text><text start="128.389" dur="2.288">the fundamental base code of life,</text><text start="130.677" dur="3.898">artificial intelligence
that can do calculations</text><text start="134.575" dur="4.014">that no type of biological
intelligence can do,</text><text start="138.589" dur="3.003">when we can extinct whole
species, destroy whole ecosystems,</text><text start="141.592" dur="2.098">build new environments,
where the Anthropocene,</text><text start="143.69" dur="2.517">the human-built environment
is the major force shaping</text><text start="146.207" dur="2.864">whole parts of the surface of the world,</text><text start="149.071" dur="1.94">that&apos;s not the power of
an apex predator, right?</text><text start="151.011" dur="2.048">No, like orcas aren&apos;t doing all that.</text><text start="153.059" dur="1.06">(Zubin laughs)
- [Zubin] Are you sure?</text><text start="154.119" dur="1.38">I don&apos;t know if you&apos;ve read
&quot;The Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide</text><text start="155.499" dur="2.774">&quot;to the Galaxy,&quot; but I believe
dolphins did a lot of damage.</text><text start="158.273" dur="4.3">- [Daniel] So trying to
model humans as, you know,</text><text start="162.573" dur="3.254">one of the primate hominids,
and apply apex predator theory,</text><text start="165.827" dur="1.408">it just clearly doesn&apos;t explain</text><text start="167.235" dur="1.445">the kind of thing that we are.</text><text start="168.68" dur="3.184">We&apos;ve had a curve of
being able to develop tech</text><text start="171.864" dur="2.338">faster than the environment
can become resilient</text><text start="174.202" dur="1.296">to the way we use that tech, right?</text><text start="175.498" dur="2.196">Predators increase, there&apos;s
a co-evolutionary process</text><text start="177.694" dur="1.997">where predators increase
their predatory capacity</text><text start="179.691" dur="2.069">through mutation at the same rate</text><text start="181.76" dur="1.551">that the prey is increasing its capacity</text><text start="183.311" dur="0.833">to avoid the predators.</text><text start="184.144" dur="1.031">The slower ones get eaten.</text><text start="185.175" dur="2.176">The faster ones inbreed,
that kind of thing.</text><text start="187.351" dur="1.811">We were able to increase
our predatory capacity</text><text start="189.162" dur="1.439">way faster than any animal was able</text><text start="190.601" dur="2.051">to increase their resilience to it.</text><text start="192.652" dur="1.442">So we were able to
overhunt an environment,</text><text start="194.094" dur="1.473">and then rather have our population check</text><text start="195.567" dur="1.408">to that environment, we were able to move,</text><text start="196.975" dur="2.194">and become the apex predator
in the next environment.</text><text start="199.169" dur="1.843">Polar bears are not apex
predators in the savanna.</text><text start="201.012" dur="0.924">Orcas aren&apos;t on land.</text><text start="201.936" dur="1.534">We went and became apex
spreaders everywhere.</text><text start="203.47" dur="2.064">We&apos;re able to overhunt an environment,</text><text start="205.534" dur="1.78">and then enslave them
through factory farming,</text><text start="207.314" dur="0.968">and other things like that.</text><text start="208.282" dur="2.27">So this really different,
it&apos;s a different thing, and-</text><text start="210.552" dur="3.614">- [Zubin] We&apos;re a whole
new genre of being, right,</text><text start="214.166" dur="2.051">to be able to do that, and is
that, and not to derail you,</text><text start="216.217" dur="3.789">but is that because we have
the capacity for language,</text><text start="220.006" dur="2.21">communication across large
groups in flexible ways</text><text start="222.216" dur="3.489">that, say, bees, or ants don&apos;t
have, or orcas don&apos;t have?</text><text start="225.705" dur="1.555">- [Daniel] Yeah, there&apos;s
a type of abstraction</text><text start="227.26" dur="2.333">that lends itself towards
the nature of our language,</text><text start="229.593" dur="1.738">and very specifically towards
the nature of our tech.</text><text start="231.331" dur="2.912">Obviously, we&apos;ll see that beavers use,</text><text start="234.243" dur="1.596">they modify their environment
in a particular way.</text><text start="235.839" dur="1.217">Birds with their nests do.</text><text start="237.056" dur="1.654">We&apos;ll obviously see whether it&apos;s birds,</text><text start="238.71" dur="2.373">or primates&apos; use of
certain kinds of objects</text><text start="241.083" dur="1.69">in their environment
that we can call a tool,</text><text start="242.773" dur="0.933">but they&apos;re not evolving the way</text><text start="243.706" dur="1.082">they do that as time goes on.</text><text start="244.788" dur="2.598">They co-evolved with some
environmental capacity</text><text start="247.386" dur="0.906">that they found.</text><text start="248.292" dur="3.255">So a chimp will use a
rock to cut something.</text><text start="251.547" dur="2.917">They&apos;ll experientially try
one rock versus another,</text><text start="254.464" dur="1.814">and whichever one they
can tell is cutting better</text><text start="256.278" dur="2.847">they&apos;ll use, but to understand
the abstract principle</text><text start="259.125" dur="2.24">of sharpness, what does this
one have more than this one</text><text start="261.365" dur="1.536">to design one that is sharper,</text><text start="262.901" dur="1.242">is a thing they don&apos;t do, right?</text><text start="264.143" dur="1.876">But it is a thing that
Homo habilis started doing,</text><text start="266.019" dur="2.569">which was how do we actually
start to create stone tools?</text><text start="268.588" dur="2.157">&apos;Cause we understand the
abstract principle of sharpness,</text><text start="270.745" dur="1.637">and can make a sharper thing,</text><text start="272.382" dur="1.691">which is understanding what
all these have in common,</text><text start="274.073" dur="1.987">but it&apos;s actually not any of them.</text><text start="276.06" dur="3.271">And then, so that process
of what humans were doing</text><text start="279.331" dur="0.908">that was different started</text><text start="280.239" dur="1.501">with the beginning of stone tools.</text><text start="281.74" dur="1.084">Obviously, it took a major jump</text><text start="282.824" dur="1.829">with the Agricultural Revolution,</text><text start="284.653" dur="2.351">took a major jump with
the Industrial Revolution,</text><text start="287.004" dur="1.796">nuclear, and then obviously with digital.</text><text start="288.8" dur="2.062">So we find ourselves in
the verticalizing part</text><text start="290.862" dur="2.191">of a long exponential curve of power,</text><text start="293.053" dur="3.39">and you can say now the power of gods,</text><text start="296.443" dur="4.042">and yet, not necessarily
a corresponding degree</text><text start="300.485" dur="2.202">of increase in wisdom for
how to use that power,</text><text start="302.687" dur="1.911">and all of the existential
threats are because of that,</text><text start="304.598" dur="2.526">because obviously stone
tools, or even agrarian tools,</text><text start="307.124" dur="1.738">can&apos;t destroy the whole world.</text><text start="308.862" dur="1.633">So catastrophic risks are always,</text><text start="310.495" dur="2.645">all the human-induced
catastrophic risks are mediated</text><text start="313.14" dur="2.401">by the level of
technological power we have</text><text start="315.541" dur="1.56">that doesn&apos;t have adequate wisdom,</text><text start="317.101" dur="2.31">prudence binding and guiding its use.</text><text start="319.411" dur="2.624">- [Zubin] So this is a great base to start</text><text start="322.035" dur="1.516">this discussion from because this idea</text><text start="323.551" dur="2.472">of all of human history
starting with Homo habilis,</text><text start="326.023" dur="2.811">you said, so this was
one of our progenitors,</text><text start="328.834" dur="2.849">able to use tools, abstract,</text><text start="331.683" dur="1.718">and actually understand the concept</text><text start="333.401" dur="2.105">of potentially of sharpness,</text><text start="335.506" dur="3.038">and that allows a kind of
recursive improvement in tools</text><text start="338.544" dur="3.012">that a chimpanzee, or a primate can&apos;t do,</text><text start="341.556" dur="2.661">because like you said, they&apos;re
co-evolving that use of tool</text><text start="344.217" dur="0.833">with their environment.</text><text start="345.05" dur="2.725">So they, maybe they notice
experientially, like you said,</text><text start="347.775" dur="1.984">that this piece of stone
cuts a little better,</text><text start="349.759" dur="1.1">so they start using it.</text><text start="350.859" dur="1.553">But they can&apos;t de novo go,</text><text start="352.412" dur="1.465">&quot;Oh, it cuts better because of sharpness.</text><text start="353.877" dur="2.193">&quot;I bet I could design a sharper tool.&quot;</text><text start="356.07" dur="3.231">So we have this really
interesting ability to do that,</text><text start="359.301" dur="2.006">and over tens of thousands of years</text><text start="361.307" dur="2.703">of Homo sapiens evolution,</text><text start="364.01" dur="2.934">it&apos;s now reaching a phase,
maybe longer, right,</text><text start="366.944" dur="2.06">it&apos;s now reaching a phase
of exponential growth,</text><text start="369.004" dur="2.182">because the technology itself is allowing</text><text start="371.186" dur="3.209">a recursive improvement
in the technology, right?</text><text start="374.395" dur="1.49">- [Daniel] And so, you know,</text><text start="375.885" dur="1.719">you were starting to talk about addiction,</text><text start="377.604" dur="1.74">and kind of the hacking
of dopamine circuits</text><text start="379.344" dur="1.432">and reward circuits.</text><text start="380.776" dur="3.309">And one way to think about
that is that Homo sapiens are</text><text start="384.085" dur="1.766">at least a few hundred thousand years old,</text><text start="385.851" dur="3.707">and obviously, the hominid
precursors to that are</text><text start="389.558" dur="1.77">at least a few million years,</text><text start="391.328" dur="3.166">and all of that genetic evolution was fit</text><text start="394.494" dur="1.385">for hunter-gatherer environments, right?</text><text start="395.879" dur="2.561">Like we were evolving reward circuits</text><text start="398.44" dur="2.189">that were relevant for
hunter-gatherer environments.</text><text start="400.629" dur="2.741">- [Zubin] Like what, like sweet taste, or-</text><text start="403.37" dur="2.891">- [Daniel] Yeah, so if we
take the reward circuits</text><text start="406.261" dur="3.809">on food, specifically,
fat, salt, and sugar create</text><text start="410.07" dur="3.275">stronger dopaminergic process
than green cellulosic stuff,</text><text start="413.345" dur="1.013">and whatever else, right?</text><text start="414.358" dur="1.914">- [Zubin] And dopamine&apos;s
our reward chemical</text><text start="416.272" dur="1.123">to make it very simple.</text><text start="417.395" dur="1.482">- [Daniel] Feels good, do it again.</text><text start="418.877" dur="1.72">Dopamine-opioid axis, right?</text><text start="420.597" dur="2.656">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] So</text><text start="423.253" dur="2.014">in an evolutionary environment,</text><text start="425.267" dur="2.202">you didn&apos;t have a lot of
salt, fat, or sugar, right?</text><text start="427.469" dur="2.319">The sugar that you had was
only pretty much gonna come</text><text start="429.788" dur="2.009">from things like fruits
that were gonna be seasonal,</text><text start="431.797" dur="1.672">and before we hybridized the fruits,</text><text start="433.469" dur="1.072">the fruits had way more seeds,</text><text start="434.541" dur="1.816">and way less fruit than
they have now, right,</text><text start="436.357" dur="0.994">in terms of most-</text><text start="437.351" dur="2.049">- [Zubin] Fiber to sugar content, yeah.</text><text start="439.4" dur="2.139">- [Daniel] And so, getting
all of that you could</text><text start="441.539" dur="1.653">that had more caloric density meant</text><text start="443.192" dur="2.333">that you had a better chance
of making it through a famine,</text><text start="445.525" dur="1.611">and possibly being able
to feed more people.</text><text start="447.136" dur="1.788">The same was true with fats,</text><text start="448.924" dur="2.697">and the same was true with
when you&apos;d find a salt source.</text><text start="451.621" dur="3.287">And so, there was evolutionary
selective advantage</text><text start="454.908" dur="1.989">on getting all of those you could.</text><text start="456.897" dur="1.492">So those who had more reward circuit</text><text start="458.389" dur="1.38">on those actually did better.</text><text start="459.769" dur="1.782">Once we figured out how
to make all the salt, fat,</text><text start="461.551" dur="2.202">sugar you want, and be
able to combine them</text><text start="463.753" dur="2.606">in the ways that maximized
addiction, right,</text><text start="466.359" dur="1.329">and remove all the micronutrients,</text><text start="467.688" dur="1.102">remove all the vitamins and minerals,</text><text start="468.79" dur="2.648">and just basically all of fast
food is just combining salt,</text><text start="471.438" dur="3.993">fat, sugar in novel ways with
maximum texture palatability,</text><text start="475.431" dur="3.317">and to drive maximum
kind of addictive process</text><text start="478.748" dur="1.548">separated from all the micronutrients.</text><text start="480.296" dur="2.856">You actually took something that,</text><text start="483.152" dur="3.322">where the evolutionary reward
was attached to a real thing.</text><text start="486.474" dur="1.52">Now, you have, of course, overweight</text><text start="487.994" dur="2.261">and obesity being one of the
main causes of health issues,</text><text start="490.255" dur="2.075">and yet the reward circuit hasn&apos;t changed.</text><text start="492.33" dur="1.244">And so, you were able to extract</text><text start="493.574" dur="1.344">the active ingredient from the thing</text><text start="494.918" dur="2.624">that it was bound to
that was actually useful.</text><text start="497.542" dur="2.819">And the same is true with porn to sex.</text><text start="500.361" dur="2.945">The same is true with social
media to tribal friendships.</text><text start="503.306" dur="2.839">The same is true with
productivity to meaning, right?</text><text start="506.145" dur="1.234">There&apos;s a whole bunch of places,</text><text start="507.379" dur="2.0">where the sexual impulse</text><text start="510.494" dur="1.543">historically would have been attached</text><text start="512.037" dur="1.548">to that mating opportunity,</text><text start="513.585" dur="4.023">was bound to you were going
to have children for your,</text><text start="517.608" dur="1.351">there was all kinds of intimacy</text><text start="518.959" dur="2.586">and things that were
required to have that happen.</text><text start="521.545" dur="2.751">Just extract the hypernormal
parts, and maximize them,</text><text start="524.296" dur="1.826">and you get porn.
- [Zubin] Ah.</text><text start="526.122" dur="1.997">- [Daniel] Same with
likes on Facebook, right?</text><text start="528.119" dur="1.145">You have no real friend.</text><text start="529.264" dur="1.708">You don&apos;t have authentic intimacy.</text><text start="530.972" dur="1.63">You don&apos;t have authentic trust.</text><text start="532.602" dur="3.502">But you have lots of positive
feedback of certain types,</text><text start="536.104" dur="2.127">which, of course, then is
gonna give you the equivalent</text><text start="538.231" dur="1.335">of overweight psychologically,</text><text start="539.566" dur="1.972">which is like narcissism and emptiness.</text><text start="541.538" dur="1.223">- [Zubin] Ooh.
- [Daniel] So you can see</text><text start="542.761" dur="4.168">that society has been oriented
to hijack reward circuits,</text><text start="546.929" dur="1.929">be able to extract the active ingredient,</text><text start="548.858" dur="1.5">double down on that separate</text><text start="550.358" dur="2.315">from the actual evolutionary
beneficial thing</text><text start="552.673" dur="1.686">that it was originally for.</text><text start="554.359" dur="1.921">And that&apos;s one of the things is</text><text start="556.28" dur="2.746">we&apos;re not genetically

fit for the Anthropocene.</text><text start="561.754" dur="3.525">And yet, we&apos;re an adaptive
enough creature, we can adapt,</text><text start="565.279" dur="2.842">but adapt, the type of creature we become</text><text start="568.121" dur="0.948">adapting to that environment</text><text start="569.069" dur="1.21">might not be the type of creature</text><text start="570.279" dur="1.892">we would choose to be otherwise.</text><text start="572.171" dur="3.019">- [Zubin] Okay, this is
the central foundation</text><text start="575.19" dur="1.092">of everything we&apos;re gonna talk about,</text><text start="576.282" dur="3.205">because the Anthropocene, this age of man,</text><text start="579.487" dur="2.41">it&apos;s so interesting that
man has those capacities</text><text start="581.897" dur="3.147">and evolves to a point where
it can generate technologies</text><text start="585.044" dur="3.248">in a society that actually feed
back to its primitive brain</text><text start="588.292" dur="2.792">in a way that it almost
is compelled to do,</text><text start="591.084" dur="2.533">like, &quot;Oh, wait, so sugar
tastes good, fat tastes good,</text><text start="593.617" dur="0.889">&quot;salt tastes good.&quot;</text><text start="594.506" dur="2.446">Fast food inevitably emerges,</text><text start="596.952" dur="2.385">because we know, and
especially when you tie it,</text><text start="599.337" dur="2.069">which we can talk about,
to economic incentives,</text><text start="601.406" dur="2.646">and capitalism, et cetera,
that allow a feedback loop</text><text start="604.052" dur="2.738">that&apos;s, oh, you can
actually get, you know,</text><text start="606.79" dur="2.472">the productivity boost of making money,</text><text start="609.262" dur="2.379">being secure, et cetera,
from selling stuff</text><text start="611.641" dur="4.931">that actually really plugs
right into our limbic mind.</text><text start="616.572" dur="4.281">And now, we have a world
where we have this,</text><text start="620.853" dur="4.12">you said it on Rogan, we
have these paleolithic minds</text><text start="624.973" dur="3.498">that are in a situation
with this godlike technology</text><text start="628.471" dur="3.523">that really hacks the
paleolithic mind to a degree.</text><text start="631.994" dur="0.928">So whether it&apos;s fast food,</text><text start="632.922" dur="1.905">whether it&apos;s social
media, whether it&apos;s porn,</text><text start="634.827" dur="2.584">and porn&apos;s something I&apos;ve
talked about long time ago,</text><text start="637.411" dur="1.434">but this, it is.</text><text start="638.845" dur="2.947">It&apos;s a decoupling of that
reward dopamine circuit</text><text start="641.792" dur="2.879">from all the meaning, the relationship,</text><text start="644.671" dur="2.324">the intrinsic connections</text><text start="646.995" dur="2.333">that sex meant historically,</text><text start="650.474" dur="2.356">even when it was less
of that, like you know,</text><text start="652.83" dur="1.713">there were polyamorous
societies, and all of this.</text><text start="654.543" dur="2.436">That&apos;s all fine, but the truth
is it had more connection</text><text start="656.979" dur="1.842">and meaning than it does
when you&apos;re surfing porn</text><text start="658.821" dur="1.115">and masturbating, right?</text><text start="659.936" dur="1.412">- [Daniel] I mean, let&apos;s
just, we won&apos;t take</text><text start="661.348" dur="1.153">too long with this, but-</text><text start="662.501" dur="1.252">- [Zubin] You can take as
long as you want with porn,</text><text start="663.753" dur="2.734">because honestly, I could
talk about it all day.</text><text start="666.487" dur="3.208">- [Daniel] Even if you
look at the multi-male,</text><text start="669.695" dur="1.838">multi-female earlier mating systems</text><text start="671.533" dur="2.442">that you&apos;d call
polyamorous mating systems,</text><text start="673.975" dur="2.624">like the ones that &quot;Sex
at Dawn&quot; talks about,</text><text start="676.599" dur="3.75">the Mosuo, or the Canela
people, or whatever,</text><text start="681.196" dur="1.814">the modern interpretation of them,</text><text start="683.01" dur="2.148">oftentimes, the people
who are proponents for it</text><text start="685.158" dur="1.342">are failing to recognize that they had</text><text start="686.5" dur="1.572">a completely different social system</text><text start="688.072" dur="1.552">that made that adaptive that also included</text><text start="689.624" dur="1.997">a different economic system, right?</text><text start="691.621" dur="2.18">So you have multi-male,
multi-female mating,</text><text start="693.801" dur="1.82">but the whole tribe raised all the kids.</text><text start="695.621" dur="1.122">- [Zubin] Uh-huh.
- [Daniel] The woman wasn&apos;t</text><text start="696.743" dur="3.521">left as a single mom, because
she lived with her family,</text><text start="700.264" dur="3.251">not with her, not with her primary,</text><text start="703.515" dur="2.807">not with the partner that inseminated her.</text><text start="706.322" dur="1.098">All of the fathers,</text><text start="707.42" dur="1.353">&apos;cause there was low paternity certainty,</text><text start="708.773" dur="3.356">all of the fathers were
contributing to all of the kids.</text><text start="712.129" dur="0.9">You actually didn&apos;t have</text><text start="713.029" dur="1.978">a primarily private property based system,</text><text start="715.007" dur="1.633">but commons based system.
- [Zubin] Uh-huh.</text><text start="716.64" dur="2.295">- [Daniel] So you can&apos;t
extract that one part</text><text start="718.935" dur="2.515">from the whole rest of it
and have it work, right?</text><text start="721.45" dur="3.134">So obviously, that system
could only be adaptive</text><text start="724.584" dur="1.891">within that context.</text><text start="726.475" dur="2.489">This was actually a very
interesting conversation</text><text start="728.964" dur="3.411">Bret Weinstein and I had
many, many years ago,</text><text start="732.375" dur="2.125">&apos;cause a lot of his evolutionary
theory background was</text><text start="734.5" dur="2.37">primate mating systems, and-
- [Zubin] Oh, wow.</text><text start="736.87" dur="1.917">- [Daniel] And he was-
- [Zubin] Monkey sex.</text><text start="738.787" dur="2.414">- [Daniel] Arguing for why</text><text start="741.201" dur="2.258">institutional monogamy did
some really important things</text><text start="743.459" dur="2.121">that a lot of people didn&apos;t understand</text><text start="745.58" dur="1.617">where the sexual revolution
really damaged it,</text><text start="747.197" dur="1.637">and I don&apos;t wanna put the
wrong words in Bret&apos;s mouth.</text><text start="748.834" dur="1.616">I&apos;m gonna share kind
of how I understand it</text><text start="750.45" dur="2.092">that was inspired by that
conversation with him.</text><text start="752.542" dur="1.946">He might hold this with more nuance,</text><text start="754.488" dur="4.25">but it was, it actually
upgraded my thinking on it.</text><text start="759.686" dur="2.053">He said if you think
about what institutional,</text><text start="761.739" dur="2.55">like when you think about
what we call civilization,</text><text start="764.289" dur="2.362">to be civilized is kind
of a domestication program</text><text start="766.651" dur="1.751">for wild humans to be
able to operate together</text><text start="768.402" dur="2.433">at larger than tribal scale-
- [Zubin] Yeah, makes sense.</text><text start="770.835" dur="1.309">- [Daniel] And for hundreds
of thousands of years,</text><text start="772.144" dur="2.191">we never got tribes bigger
than about 150 people.</text><text start="774.335" dur="1.248">They stayed at very small scales,</text><text start="775.583" dur="1.166">where everybody knew everybody,</text><text start="776.749" dur="1.739">so that the sacrifices you made for others</text><text start="778.488" dur="1.065">were non-anonymous people.</text><text start="779.553" dur="2.101">They were people that
you knew really well,</text><text start="781.654" dur="3.135">and that you wouldn&apos;t do
that at much larger sizes.</text><text start="784.789" dur="1.904">And so, then the much larger thing,</text><text start="786.693" dur="1.362">the thing we call civilization,</text><text start="788.055" dur="2.372">can also be thought of as
a domestication program.</text><text start="790.427" dur="1.45">- [Zubin] Huh.
- [Daniel] And the main things</text><text start="791.877" dur="1.38">you have to domesticate out of people</text><text start="793.257" dur="1.215">that make them not work other well</text><text start="794.472" dur="1.887">have to do with sex and violence.</text><text start="796.359" dur="1.125">And so, this is also where most</text><text start="797.484" dur="1.32">of the psychological shadow comes,</text><text start="798.804" dur="1.275">and it&apos;s why the intersection of sex</text><text start="800.079" dur="1.202">and violence is the deepest part</text><text start="801.281" dur="1.402">of most people&apos;s psychological shadow.</text><text start="802.683" dur="0.933">- [Zubin] Oh.</text><text start="803.616" dur="4.25">- [Daniel] They&apos;re kind of
put into the same areas.</text><text start="809.271" dur="2.775">But if you think about what
institutional monogamy occurring</text><text start="812.046" dur="3.169">with that context, one of the
things that it was designed,</text><text start="815.215" dur="2.067">or a few of the things
it&apos;s designed to do,</text><text start="817.282" dur="2.612">if you couldn&apos;t have sex
until getting married,</text><text start="819.894" dur="1.703">and then you weren&apos;t allowed to divorce,</text><text start="821.597" dur="1.602">and that was actually held,</text><text start="823.199" dur="1.583">and of course, no system
will be perfectly held,</text><text start="824.782" dur="4.653">but like just the idea,
then in order to get laid,</text><text start="829.435" dur="3.554">a guy had to get a girl&apos;s parents,</text><text start="832.989" dur="2.153">and preacher, and community to decide</text><text start="835.142" dur="1.84">that he was an acceptable
husband and father.</text><text start="836.982" dur="1.156">- [Zubin] Hmm.</text><text start="838.138" dur="3.08">- [Daniel] And that, and
the binding of his ability</text><text start="841.218" dur="2.789">to get laid to his ability
to be a good father long-term</text><text start="844.007" dur="1.522">meant that there was an incentive</text><text start="845.529" dur="2.663">for him to actually be
a good guy long-term,</text><text start="848.192" dur="2.938">which meant who, him being
a good guy for civilization</text><text start="851.13" dur="4.365">and him being a good guy
as a father were bound</text><text start="855.495" dur="2.29">to his need to get laid, right?</text><text start="857.785" dur="2.165">And that there was a vetting beyond her,</text><text start="859.95" dur="2.45">who might have already
got oxytocin to not be,</text><text start="862.4" dur="1.529">you know, assessing him
well, &apos;cause of the crush</text><text start="863.929" dur="1.526">that the father, and the mother,</text><text start="865.455" dur="1.748">and the whatever would
also be helping to assess,</text><text start="867.203" dur="1.497">to grant the right to do the thing.</text><text start="868.7" dur="2.426">And then in the wedding
ceremony, does anyone object?</text><text start="871.126" dur="1.28">If he had been an asshole to other people,</text><text start="872.406" dur="1.239">and they got to bring that up,</text><text start="873.645" dur="1.433">so he has to be an asshole to nobody,</text><text start="875.078" dur="1.671">otherwise, he&apos;s never gonna be laid.</text><text start="876.749" dur="3.141">Then this would also be even
where the slut-shaming came,</text><text start="879.89" dur="2.177">which is such a terrible
thing in our modern context,</text><text start="882.067" dur="1.736">but I was coming to understand</text><text start="883.803" dur="2.704">where a possible evolutionary
relevance of it was-</text><text start="886.507" dur="1.029">- [Zubin] Yeah, yeah.
- [Daniel] Was that</text><text start="887.536" dur="3.025">if any women would start
to have sex with guys</text><text start="890.561" dur="1.357">outside of the marriage context,</text><text start="891.918" dur="1.907">which would mean that
assholes could get laid,</text><text start="893.825" dur="1.765">it creates an evolutionary
niche for assholes</text><text start="895.59" dur="1.151">to actually be able to make it,</text><text start="896.741" dur="1.76">and then those guys figure
out how to get more women</text><text start="898.501" dur="1.298">to do that thing,</text><text start="899.799" dur="2.614">and so, the idea was
almost like herd immunity.</text><text start="902.413" dur="2.119">The idea was a collectivist idea.</text><text start="904.532" dur="1.59">You actually have to close the niche</text><text start="906.122" dur="1.985">for assholes comprehensively.</text><text start="908.107" dur="1.954">If you want a civilization to go well,</text><text start="910.061" dur="2.798">guys are going to do what
they need to do to get laid.</text><text start="912.859" dur="2.273">So if you bind the opportunity to get laid</text><text start="915.132" dur="2.438">to being a good citizen with
multiple people vetting it,</text><text start="917.57" dur="1.106">that&apos;s a good system.</text><text start="918.676" dur="1.025">It&apos;s actually interesting, right?</text><text start="919.701" dur="2.66">Like most people, myself included,</text><text start="922.361" dur="3.498">who kind of grew up in a
more post-sexual revolution,</text><text start="925.859" dur="3.677">liberated idea, thought of that
as just oppressive nonsense.</text><text start="929.536" dur="1.267">- [Zubin] Right.
- [Daniel] And then I&apos;m like,</text><text start="930.803" dur="1.372">&quot;Oh, that&apos;s actually interesting.&quot;</text><text start="932.175" dur="2.136">So then the idea was
that with birth control,</text><text start="934.311" dur="1.399">you kind of have a sexual revolution.</text><text start="935.71" dur="1.984">It seems like it&apos;s liberating
for women in particular,</text><text start="937.694" dur="1.477">because you decouple sex</text><text start="939.171" dur="1.375">and reproduction for the first time.</text><text start="940.546" dur="1.207">- [Zubin] Right.
- [Daniel] Where historically</text><text start="941.753" dur="3.699">you could never really decouple
sex and reproduction well,</text><text start="945.452" dur="2.913">which is also why that was
gonna inexorably affect</text><text start="948.365" dur="1.149">her biology more than his,</text><text start="949.514" dur="2.483">because he could possibly get laid,</text><text start="951.997" dur="2.622">have a genetic benefit to do
so, and have no consequence,</text><text start="954.619" dur="1.246">and she could not have no consequence.</text><text start="955.865" dur="2.502">It&apos;d be a life or death
possible thing for her, right?</text><text start="958.367" dur="2.498">And so, of course she&apos;ll
have higher criteria</text><text start="960.865" dur="2.253">and more bonding biologically oriented,</text><text start="963.118" dur="2.402">which makes perfect sense
that it should be that way.</text><text start="965.52" dur="1.51">But then she&apos;s able to kind of let that go</text><text start="967.03" dur="1.713">and be a liberated modern person</text><text start="968.743" dur="1.271">because of the birth control pill,</text><text start="970.014" dur="1.577">but her evolutionary
biology hasn&apos;t changed.</text><text start="971.591" dur="2.04">Again, just like I can&apos;t eat
all of the chocolate cake</text><text start="973.631" dur="2.157">that I want and not get fat
just cause I want to, right?</text><text start="975.788" dur="1.351">The biology is the way that it is-</text><text start="977.139" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] The biology&apos;s still there-</text><text start="977.972" dur="1.634">- [Daniel] I don&apos;t get to just
separate the reward circuit.</text><text start="979.606" dur="2.578">- [Zubin] Right.
- [Daniel] And so,</text><text start="982.184" dur="1.909">then the idea that after that there was</text><text start="984.093" dur="1.537">more of an evolutionary niche</text><text start="985.63" dur="2.938">where assholes could get
well-laid as a result of that,</text><text start="988.568" dur="1.858">and that that actually has
a culture-damaging property.</text><text start="990.426" dur="4.115">So if you wanna go the
convention of marriage,</text><text start="994.541" dur="2.518">if you wanna not drop to
pre-conventional developmentally</text><text start="997.059" dur="2.642">meaning more selfish than the convention,</text><text start="999.701" dur="2.177">but go to truly post-conventional,</text><text start="1001.878" dur="1.373">the post-conventional has to be, okay,</text><text start="1003.251" dur="2.204">well, how do I have, how
do the individuals have</text><text start="1005.455" dur="1.503">more freedom than the
institution of marriage</text><text start="1006.958" dur="1.731">to make that choice while
still paying attention</text><text start="1008.689" dur="2.837">and not creating niches for bad behavior</text><text start="1011.526" dur="1.468">to be able to propagate?</text><text start="1012.994" dur="1.305">Just an interesting topic.</text><text start="1014.299" dur="2.64">- [Zubin] You know, it&apos;s (laughs), man,</text><text start="1016.939" dur="1.122">I didn&apos;t think we&apos;d be talking about that,</text><text start="1018.061" dur="2.136">but it&apos;s fascinating, and you
know what&apos;s really interesting</text><text start="1020.197" dur="2.311">about it is it binds this idea</text><text start="1022.508" dur="1.981">that you have this particular hardware,</text><text start="1024.489" dur="1.236">this biology that&apos;s evolved</text><text start="1025.725" dur="1.42">over however many millions of hundreds</text><text start="1027.145" dur="2.359">and millions of years, but
then you have the software</text><text start="1029.504" dur="3.51">of the world that feeds back onto it,</text><text start="1033.014" dur="1.254">and emerges from it.</text><text start="1034.268" dur="3.568">So the particular constraints
of the hardware may create</text><text start="1037.836" dur="3.297">a social dynamic where,
again, guys have to be good,</text><text start="1041.133" dur="2.72">they are vetted by the family,</text><text start="1043.853" dur="3.898">wait &apos;til marriage to get
laid, reduce asshole agenesis,</text><text start="1047.751" dur="1.561">and that helps civilization,</text><text start="1049.312" dur="2.47">and helps the short-term marriage.</text><text start="1051.782" dur="3.188">And so, that dynamic feeding
back with the biology</text><text start="1054.97" dur="2.344">creates the emergent civilization.</text><text start="1057.314" dur="1.478">Now, we&apos;re in a situation where we&apos;ve,</text><text start="1058.792" dur="1.745">and like you said, a good
example of birth control,</text><text start="1060.537" dur="1.186">and again, neither one of us is saying,</text><text start="1061.723" dur="1.387">&quot;Oh, dude, get rid of birth control,</text><text start="1063.11" dur="2.292">&quot;go back to a dowry,&quot; right?</text><text start="1065.402" dur="2.518">No, we&apos;re saying the environment</text><text start="1067.92" dur="2.698">and the hardware actually interact,</text><text start="1070.618" dur="2.231">and we better be aware

or traditional intuition is</text><text start="1112.599" dur="2.954">the idea that if there&apos;s a social system</text><text start="1115.553" dur="3.343">that made it through the
trials of evolutionary history,</text><text start="1118.896" dur="1.429">and there&apos;s lots of them that failed,</text><text start="1120.325" dur="2.777">it probably has a lot of embedded
wisdom that isn&apos;t obvious.</text><text start="1123.102" dur="1.501">It probably made it through for a reason.</text><text start="1124.603" dur="2.414">So go back to the old, keep the old thing,</text><text start="1127.017" dur="1.896">whether it&apos;s the Founding
Fathers, or Christianity,</text><text start="1128.913" dur="0.944">or whatever the thing is, right,</text><text start="1129.857" dur="1.494">that you&apos;re trying to conserve,</text><text start="1131.351" dur="2.059">that there might be reasons why it worked</text><text start="1133.41" dur="2.281">that we don&apos;t even understand well,</text><text start="1135.691" dur="1.617">but that were, that it was tested,</text><text start="1137.308" dur="1.997">and you know, tried and true, and so-</text><text start="1139.305" dur="1.144">- [Zubin] Proof is in the pudding-</text><text start="1140.449" dur="0.972">- [Daniel] Of that.
- [Zubin] Yes, yes.</text><text start="1141.421" dur="1.003">- [Daniel] The progressive intuition is</text><text start="1142.424" dur="2.37">we&apos;re facing novel situations
that we never faced,</text><text start="1144.794" dur="1.316">and that the things
that worked in the past</text><text start="1146.11" dur="2.395">couldn&apos;t possibly work for
that, and innovation is needed.</text><text start="1148.505" dur="3.174">These are obviously both true,
and need to be in dialectic.</text><text start="1151.679" dur="2.268">So the idea that either
of those would be adequate</text><text start="1153.947" dur="2.455">is nonsense, &apos;cause if
the new thing you&apos;re doing</text><text start="1156.402" dur="1.695">doesn&apos;t factor that most
of the environment is still</text><text start="1158.097" dur="1.61">the same and the things
that worked might work</text><text start="1159.707" dur="0.833">for reasons you don&apos;t know,</text><text start="1160.54" dur="1.573">and you throw the traditional
thing out too fast,</text><text start="1162.113" dur="1.613">then realize it was doing
things you didn&apos;t realize,</text><text start="1163.726" dur="1.315">and you just fucked up-
- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="1165.041" dur="2.27">- [Daniel] Right, so the
progressive often doesn&apos;t</text><text start="1167.311" dur="2.777">pay enough attention to
the traditional impulse,</text><text start="1170.088" dur="1.155">and vice versa.</text><text start="1171.243" dur="2.682">- [Zubin] 1,000%, and the

of people in my audience,</text><text start="1176.882" dur="1.298">and we use this term alt-middle,</text><text start="1178.18" dur="1.496">because it&apos;s kind of a meme-y phrase,</text><text start="1179.676" dur="1.209">but it&apos;s really not quite right.</text><text start="1180.885" dur="2.076">It&apos;s a parody of

actually a higher order thinking</text><text start="1190.698" dur="2.608">&quot;and complexity that&apos;s needed
to integrate the two sides,&quot;</text><text start="1193.306" dur="1.937">because each side on its own is missing</text><text start="1195.243" dur="1.962">a big piece of the complexity.</text><text start="1197.205" dur="1.861">So how do we integrate that?</text><text start="1199.066" dur="3.026">And again, to have that
standpoint actually,</text><text start="1202.092" dur="1.924">or at least have it aspirationally,</text><text start="1204.016" dur="2.605">means inhabiting each side, right?</text><text start="1206.621" dur="2.115">And again, I promise we&apos;ll

from the integral community,</text><text start="1229.247" dur="2.949">Clint Fuhs, who did a doctoral thesis</text><text start="1232.196" dur="5.0">that I found really interesting
several years ago on this,</text><text start="1237.584" dur="1.389">in the field of developmental psychology</text><text start="1238.973" dur="1.692">what are higher stages of development,</text><text start="1240.665" dur="2.399">meaning people who can
process more complexity</text><text start="1243.064" dur="2.375">with more nuance, and what are the things</text><text start="1245.439" dur="3.0">that correlate with that the most.</text><text start="1248.439" dur="2.071">And for a long time,
there had been this idea</text><text start="1250.51" dur="1.82">that perspective-taking was the key</text><text start="1252.33" dur="0.981">to the correlation of that.</text><text start="1253.311" dur="3.878">People with kind of higher
stages of hierarchical complexity</text><text start="1257.189" dur="1.871">could take more different perspectives,</text><text start="1259.06" dur="2.336">and the kind of nuance, if
I&apos;m understanding rightly</text><text start="1261.396" dur="2.408">what his work added,
was it was actually not</text><text start="1263.804" dur="1.925">perspective-taking as much
as perspective-seeking.</text><text start="1265.729" dur="2.457">It was actually an impetus
to seek the perspectives,</text><text start="1268.186" dur="2.354">not simply the capacity to
take them without doing it.</text><text start="1270.54" dur="0.869">- [Zubin] Oh, interesting.</text><text start="1271.409" dur="0.885">- [Daniel] And so-</text><text start="1272.294" dur="1.78">- [Zubin] Intention, drive, motivation</text><text start="1274.074" dur="2.226">to actually see another&apos;s perspective.</text><text start="1276.3" dur="1.745">- [Daniel] And so, it&apos;s
interesting to think</text><text start="1278.045" dur="2.449">that the thing that would
be the generator function</text><text start="1280.494" dur="2.396">of complexity of thought the most is</text><text start="1282.89" dur="2.38">the innate impulse to try to understand</text><text start="1285.27" dur="1.045">where people are coming from,</text><text start="1286.315" dur="1.253">and be able to see their worldview,</text><text start="1287.568" dur="3.002">and then be able to run
parallax across lots of those.</text><text start="1290.57" dur="3.178">So perspective-seeking,
then perspective-taking,</text><text start="1293.748" dur="2.314">then perspective analysis,
can I error correct them,</text><text start="1296.062" dur="1.426">then perspective synthesis.</text><text start="1297.488" dur="2.57">- [Zubin] Okay, so that&apos;s the process.</text><text start="1300.058" dur="1.658">You know, it&apos;s interesting, because I find</text><text start="1301.716" dur="3.275">that one of the biggest rushes I get is</text><text start="1304.991" dur="3.219">when somebody that I disagree
with explains their position</text><text start="1308.21" dur="2.051">to me in a way that I deeply inhabit it,</text><text start="1310.261" dur="1.172">like I&apos;m like, &quot;Oh my gosh!&quot;</text><text start="1311.433" dur="2.047">That&apos;s like a, it&apos;s like
a dopamine rush in itself,</text><text start="1313.48" dur="1.922">like, &quot;I understand, okay.&quot;</text><text start="1315.402" dur="1.135">Now, I can actually,</text><text start="1316.537" dur="2.295">and I actually have that
desire to understand it.</text><text start="1318.832" dur="2.858">But there are some spaces
where I&apos;m much more closed off</text><text start="1321.69" dur="1.117">to understanding other perspectives,</text><text start="1322.807" dur="2.868">like if I&apos;m having an argument
with, you know, a friend,</text><text start="1325.675" dur="1.995">or something else,
there&apos;s more of a block.</text><text start="1327.67" dur="1.705">So it&apos;s not a one-size-fits-all,</text><text start="1329.375" dur="3.96">but in general, I think that
that intention, that desire,</text><text start="1333.335" dur="2.481">that sort of little internal reward</text><text start="1335.816" dur="2.827">from getting to inhabit
another perspective,</text><text start="1338.643" dur="1.612">in other words, the
possibility of it leads</text><text start="1340.255" dur="1.55">to the intention to some degree.</text><text start="1341.805" dur="0.985">- [Daniel] Okay, you
just mentioned something</text><text start="1342.79" dur="0.881">that I think is real interesting,</text><text start="1343.671" dur="1.839">and we&apos;ll go back to
where we were earlier,</text><text start="1345.51" dur="1.599">which is you said you get
a bit of a dopamine hit</text><text start="1347.109" dur="3.048">from understanding the view of someone</text><text start="1350.157" dur="1.42">that you hadn&apos;t previously understood,</text><text start="1351.577" dur="1.336">where kind of the world opens up,</text><text start="1352.913" dur="1.423">something makes more sense.</text><text start="1354.336" dur="2.417">There&apos;s like a reward circuit</text><text start="1358.239" dur="2.738">on increased clarity, or insight.</text><text start="1360.977" dur="1.327">The thing I would bring up here is</text><text start="1362.304" dur="2.179">that not all reward circuits
are equally healthy, right?</text><text start="1364.483" dur="2.315">There are hijacked reward circuits</text><text start="1366.798" dur="2.472">that are mostly entropic,</text><text start="1369.27" dur="1.234">and then there are reward circuits</text><text start="1370.504" dur="1.835">that are mostly healthier, syntropic.</text><text start="1372.339" dur="2.386">- [Zubin] So entropic

everything in the direction</text><text start="1380.023" dur="2.273">of addiction is kind of
entropic reward circuit,</text><text start="1382.296" dur="2.725">or a kind of downgrading reward circuit,</text><text start="1385.021" dur="3.299">and almost all of the
upgrading reward circuits</text><text start="1388.32" dur="3.083">don&apos;t provide a easy spike of reward.</text><text start="1393.198" dur="3.434">They require some work,
and then reward occurs,</text><text start="1396.632" dur="2.35">and this is the one marshmallow,

very famous, classic,</text><text start="1403.603" dur="1.3">many times repeated study.</text><text start="1404.903" dur="2.71">There&apos;s a lot of interesting
nuance on the study,</text><text start="1407.613" dur="3.671">but basically, you put kids in a room,</text><text start="1411.284" dur="1.533">and the study is set up.</text><text start="1412.817" dur="3.782">They get one, there&apos;s a
marshmallow on the table.</text><text start="1416.599" dur="1.879">The researcher sets a clock
for some amount of time,</text><text start="1418.478" dur="1.889">like 15 minutes, says, &quot;If
you wanna eat this marshmallow</text><text start="1420.367" dur="0.833">&quot;at any time you can,</text><text start="1421.2" dur="1.394">&quot;but then you only get
that one marshmallow.</text><text start="1422.594" dur="2.712">&quot;If you wait the whole 15
minutes, and you don&apos;t eat it,</text><text start="1425.306" dur="1.377">&quot;when I come back, I&apos;ll
give you two marshmallows.&quot;</text><text start="1426.683" dur="1.376">Well, first, assessing they&apos;d rather have</text><text start="1428.059" dur="0.883">two marshmallows than one.</text><text start="1428.942" dur="3.0">So it&apos;s a impulse, a delayed impulse</text><text start="1432.951" dur="2.157">and impulse control kind of study.</text><text start="1435.108" dur="2.879">And it was found that the kids that ate,</text><text start="1437.987" dur="2.313">could wait and got two

had higher incarceration,</text><text start="1443.449" dur="2.195">did less well on their

starting at like age five.</text><text start="1451.037" dur="1.232">And so, it was pretty,</text><text start="1452.269" dur="2.17">almost bothersomely deterministic-</text><text start="1454.439" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] Right.

an assessment of capacity</text><text start="1465.305" dur="1.783">for long-term orientation.
- [Zubin] Hmm.</text><text start="1467.088" dur="2.938">- [Daniel] And intentionality.</text><text start="1470.026" dur="2.743">And so, there are two different

actually feel more uncomfortable.</text><text start="1483.355" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] Yeah.

doesn&apos;t give you the hit</text><text start="1496.795" dur="1.861">that just eating the chocolate
cake in the moment does.</text><text start="1498.656" dur="2.628">I get an instant hit of increased pleasure</text><text start="1501.284" dur="1.57">from the chocolate cake-

good I feel in my body</text><text start="1508.751" dur="2.154">as I keep doing that over time goes up.</text><text start="1510.905" dur="1.617">As I keep eating the

getting more inflammation,</text><text start="1514.736" dur="2.064">and obesity, and those
types of things, right?</text><text start="1516.8" dur="2.154">So the chocolate cake
reward circuit gives me</text><text start="1518.954" dur="2.413">an immediate spike and then a drop,</text><text start="1521.367" dur="1.993">and then the drop says now

spiral into entropy, yeah.</text><text start="1530.909" dur="1.315">- [Daniel] With exercise,
it&apos;s the other one.</text><text start="1532.224" dur="2.226">The same is true, &apos;cause

are there, et cetera.</text><text start="1612.893" dur="2.981">And the idea that there&apos;s
two sides of that,</text><text start="1615.874" dur="2.65">and actually, this is a good
idea to introduce this term</text><text start="1618.524" dur="2.841">of hormesis, which you and I
were talking about offline,</text><text start="1621.365" dur="1.476">the idea that you have
this addiction circuit</text><text start="1622.841" dur="2.531">where you get a reward, but
then you drop to a baseline</text><text start="1625.372" dur="2.246">that&apos;s below the original baseline,</text><text start="1627.618" dur="2.257">and then it&apos;s a downward spiral,</text><text start="1629.875" dur="2.533">versus hormesis, which
is more like exercise.</text><text start="1632.408" dur="1.574">Can you explain hormesis?
- [Daniel] Yeah.</text><text start="1633.982" dur="3.016">And I just wanna say, because
you have an educated audience,</text><text start="1636.998" dur="2.061">we&apos;re simplifying
everything for model purpose</text><text start="1639.059" dur="1.149">and speed purpose.</text><text start="1640.208" dur="1.884">Obviously, it&apos;s not just dopamine, right?</text><text start="1642.092" dur="3.0">You can have a limbic hijack that is</text><text start="1646.151" dur="1.446">more around fear, or outrage,</text><text start="1647.597" dur="3.757">and it&apos;s epinephrine, and
adrenaline, and cortisol,</text><text start="1651.354" dur="2.408">but it is also gonna create a certain kind</text><text start="1653.762" dur="2.073">of motivational process.</text><text start="1655.835" dur="2.795">And so, when we say
dopamine reward circuit,</text><text start="1658.63" dur="3.048">we&apos;re really simplifying some kind</text><text start="1661.678" dur="3.083">of quick motivational neurochemistry.</text><text start="1667.378" dur="1.674">- [Zubin] 1,000%, and
even the neurochemistry,</text><text start="1669.052" dur="2.699">there&apos;s even epiphenomenon
around neurochemicals,</text><text start="1671.751" dur="1.835">and glial cells, and all of that, yeah.</text><text start="1673.586" dur="3.296">So we&apos;re making, yeah, again,
all the models are models.</text><text start="1676.882" dur="2.405">- [Daniel] Useful to start
to help understand the thing,</text><text start="1679.287" dur="2.281">and then don&apos;t idolize &apos;em.
- [Zubin] Yes.</text><text start="1681.568" dur="0.833">- [Daniel] Okay, hormesis,</text><text start="1682.401" dur="4.071">so the idea with exercise
that if you&apos;re moving</text><text start="1686.472" dur="2.608">an amount of weight that
is really, really easy,</text><text start="1689.08" dur="1.313">you&apos;re probably not gonna
get that much muscle growth,</text><text start="1690.393" dur="2.397">because there&apos;s no reason
for a bunch of muscle growth.</text><text start="1692.79" dur="3.253">Muscle growth, like you&apos;re
gonna have to be able</text><text start="1696.043" dur="2.039">to consume more food to
support those muscles.</text><text start="1698.082" dur="2.496">There&apos;s energy involved
in the anabolism there.</text><text start="1700.578" dur="2.01">So the body&apos;s only gonna
do it if it has to,</text><text start="1702.588" dur="2.253">and it has to because you&apos;re
stressing its current capacity.</text><text start="1704.841" dur="4.329">So it&apos;s when you are at the
edge of your adaptive capacity</text><text start="1709.17" dur="2.661">that the system says, &quot;Oh,
we might actually not be safe</text><text start="1711.831" dur="1.445">&quot;if we don&apos;t increase adaptive capacity,</text><text start="1713.276" dur="1.75">&quot;&apos;cause we&apos;re having
to engage in situations</text><text start="1715.026" dur="1.873">&quot;that need all of the
capacity we currently have.</text><text start="1716.899" dur="0.87">&quot;Let&apos;s generate more,&quot; right?</text><text start="1717.769" dur="3.422">So hormesis is the property
of systems to upregulate</text><text start="1721.191" dur="1.815">their capacity and response to stress</text><text start="1723.006" dur="2.203">that is near the boundary
of what they can handle.</text><text start="1725.209" dur="2.345">And exercise is a classic example,</text><text start="1727.554" dur="2.517">but that&apos;s why you do hot-cold therapy is,</text><text start="1730.071" dur="1.973">one of the reasons for hot-cold therapy is</text><text start="1732.044" dur="1.961">you&apos;re creating a kind
of metabolic hormesis,</text><text start="1734.005" dur="2.471">and as you&apos;re exposing
yourself to more variance</text><text start="1736.476" dur="1.865">of temperature, the
body actually regulates.</text><text start="1738.341" dur="1.915">It has an impetus to
regulate its own temperature,</text><text start="1740.256" dur="2.59">which means more kind of
metabolic flexibility.</text><text start="1742.846" dur="2.552">But hormesis in general,</text><text start="1745.398" dur="2.749">like the two-marshmallow
reward circuits are</text><text start="1748.147" dur="1.167">usually more hormetic, right?</text><text start="1749.314" dur="3.099">They usually involve stressing
your current capacity,</text><text start="1752.413" dur="2.678">and then you get a reward on new capacity.</text><text start="1755.091" dur="2.061">But obviously, the
addictive things generally</text><text start="1757.152" dur="1.42">don&apos;t require you stressing your capacity.</text><text start="1758.572" dur="2.776">They give you some kind of hit</text><text start="1761.348" dur="1.737">within the current capacity limits,</text><text start="1763.085" dur="2.042">and usually in ways that
downgrade the capacity levels-</text><text start="1765.127" dur="1.705">- [Zubin] Overall, yeah.</text><text start="1766.832" dur="1.753">- [Daniel] So there&apos;s
a cognitive hormesis.</text><text start="1768.585" dur="1.133">There&apos;s an emotional hormesis.</text><text start="1769.718" dur="1.908">There&apos;s spiritual hormesis, right?</text><text start="1771.626" dur="1.925">So the cognitive hormesis,</text><text start="1773.551" dur="3.195">like if weightlifting, or
sprinting, or whatever it is,</text><text start="1776.746" dur="2.677">is gonna be like a physiological hormesis,</text><text start="1779.423" dur="2.795">the cognitive one is you&apos;re going to feel</text><text start="1782.218" dur="2.83">some kind of stress, pain associated</text><text start="1785.048" dur="2.23">with being at the edge
of your attention span.</text><text start="1787.278" dur="2.846">Like if I&apos;m reading text,
and my mind&apos;s wandering,</text><text start="1790.124" dur="0.902">it&apos;s the ability to keep</text><text start="1791.026" dur="1.681">fucking focusing my mind on purpose.</text><text start="1792.707" dur="3.086">It is growing attention span
as a, like a muscular capacity.</text><text start="1795.793" dur="1.472">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] But I don&apos;t get it</text><text start="1797.265" dur="1.379">if I&apos;m not actually working at it,</text><text start="1798.644" dur="1.919">and if I&apos;m not at the
limit of my attention,</text><text start="1800.563" dur="0.833">I&apos;m not gonna grow my attention-</text><text start="1801.396" dur="1.091">- [Zubin] It won&apos;t push, yeah.</text><text start="1802.487" dur="1.032">It won&apos;t push through.</text><text start="1803.519" dur="3.005">So this idea that in a way,</text><text start="1806.524" dur="1.837">when we&apos;re seeking other opinions,</text><text start="1808.361" dur="2.369">or we&apos;re trying to use
an integral perspective,</text><text start="1810.73" dur="2.31">an alt-middle perspective,
to try to synthesize,</text><text start="1813.04" dur="2.538">we&apos;re pushing ourselves
through a discomfort,</text><text start="1815.578" dur="2.658">not to the point of failure,
where we&apos;ve injured the system,</text><text start="1818.236" dur="1.385">but to the point where the system goes,</text><text start="1819.621" dur="2.351">&quot;Wait, humans are anti-fragile,&quot;</text><text start="1821.972" dur="3.197">which we&apos;ll probably talk
about, where that kind of stress</text><text start="1825.169" dur="3.414">actually does create that hormetic effect,</text><text start="1828.583" dur="3.68">where the system then responds
by getting more capacity.</text><text start="1832.263" dur="1.661">- [Daniel] And then there&apos;s
a reward circuit on that</text><text start="1833.924" dur="2.386">that is fundamentally a
healthier, more aligned one,</text><text start="1836.31" dur="2.298">both healthier for the being,
and healthier for the way</text><text start="1838.608" dur="1.64">that being can relate with the world.</text><text start="1840.248" dur="3.15">- [Zubin] Exactly, so it&apos;s
actually a virtuous reward system</text><text start="1843.398" dur="1.687">as opposed to the addictive reward system.</text><text start="1845.085" dur="4.305">So how then, now we have
this human mind that&apos;s,</text><text start="1849.39" dur="2.489">you know, paleolithic, and
it&apos;s now put in a world</text><text start="1851.879" dur="2.306">where we have a different technology</text><text start="1854.185" dur="2.033">that is relying on reward circuits</text><text start="1856.218" dur="2.845">that maybe are not as

in this conversation?</text><text start="1862.275" dur="2.417">- [Daniel] I would argue that</text><text start="1867.648" dur="3.106">capitalism can exploit
one-marshmallow processes</text><text start="1870.754" dur="1.746">better than two-marshmallow processes.</text><text start="1872.5" dur="1.237">- [Zubin] Interesting.</text><text start="1873.737" dur="1.004">So are you some kind of communist?</text><text start="1874.741" dur="2.496">I&apos;m just gonna establish this now.</text><text start="1877.237" dur="2.5">- [Daniel] No, the critiques of,</text><text start="1879.737" dur="1.885">I mean, capitalism doesn&apos;t mean one thing.</text><text start="1881.622" dur="2.698">For some people, they think
about that as any system</text><text start="1884.32" dur="1.583">primarily based on private
property ownership,</text><text start="1885.903" dur="1.128">which would&apos;ve included feudalism,</text><text start="1887.031" dur="1.281">and a different version, whatever.</text><text start="1888.312" dur="1.167">And obviously,</text><text start="1894.111" dur="3.777">Adam Smith capitalism and Milton
Friedman capitalism are not</text><text start="1897.888" dur="1.295">the same kinds of structures,</text><text start="1899.183" dur="1.429">so with and without a central bank,</text><text start="1900.612" dur="1.992">with and without AI high-speed trading</text><text start="1902.604" dur="1.207">of complex financial instruments.</text><text start="1903.811" dur="2.313">They&apos;re totally different structures.</text><text start="1906.124" dur="2.447">I would say all versions

- [Daniel] There&apos;s a lot</text><text start="1916.389" dur="1.275">to learn from all of them.</text><text start="1917.664" dur="2.261">There&apos;s a lot about theory
of markets that&apos;s important,</text><text start="1919.925" dur="2.566">but the long-term system,</text><text start="1922.491" dur="3.344">like what isn&apos;t, what do
we have to think about</text><text start="1925.835" dur="2.076">in terms of economics
for making it through</text><text start="1927.911" dur="1.692">all of the catastrophic
risks the world faces?</text><text start="1929.603" dur="1.55">And if it&apos;s not obvious,</text><text start="1931.153" dur="2.38">briefly, what the catastrophic risks are,</text><text start="1933.533" dur="2.202">you have all the environmental risks</text><text start="1935.735" dur="1.786">that are the result of
the cumulative effects</text><text start="1937.521" dur="2.322">of industrialization and globalization.</text><text start="1939.843" dur="2.727">And so, dead zones in oceans, overfishing,</text><text start="1942.57" dur="3.005">biodiversity law, species
extinction, topsoil erosion,</text><text start="1945.575" dur="2.671">climate change, blah, blah,

can replenish themselves,</text><text start="1956.134" dur="1.227">and turn them into waste much faster</text><text start="1957.361" dur="2.018">than the earth can process them,</text><text start="1959.379" dur="2.679">i.e. a linear materials economy

of the monetary system forces</text><text start="1970.735" dur="4.085">an exponential growth
of depletion on one side</text><text start="1974.82" dur="2.208">and pollution on the other side.</text><text start="1977.028" dur="1.757">You get all the planetary boundary issues.</text><text start="1978.785" dur="1.532">So that&apos;s one set of things,</text><text start="1980.317" dur="1.81">and obviously, there&apos;s an economic driver</text><text start="1982.127" dur="0.962">associated with all of that, right?</text><text start="1983.089" dur="2.502">We have to change economics

the economic system creates</text><text start="2036.199" dur="2.397">a discount rate on future value,</text><text start="2038.596" dur="1.345">one, &apos;cause you can&apos;t predict it fully,</text><text start="2039.941" dur="2.604">but two, the current value gives me</text><text start="2042.545" dur="2.151">the ability to invest that capital,</text><text start="2044.696" dur="1.478">and make compounding interest,</text><text start="2046.174" dur="2.452">or other kinds of financial

the environment will hold,</text><text start="2054.356" dur="1.19">and wanting to do the best I can,</text><text start="2055.546" dur="2.241">I want the most choice tokens, right?</text><text start="2057.787" dur="1.952">And the dollar is a choice token.</text><text start="2059.739" dur="3.658">It&apos;s the ability to, with
very high optionality</text><text start="2063.397" dur="3.527">and high liquidity, do

that has no real value, right,</text><text start="2089.398" dur="1.863">the dollar is purely

whether it&apos;s synthetic bio,</text><text start="2328.327" dur="1.36">or CRISPR, or whatever,</text><text start="2329.687" dur="2.651">is because as fucked up as nukes are,</text><text start="2332.338" dur="0.991">they don&apos;t make more nukes.</text><text start="2333.329" dur="1.894">They don&apos;t automatically

incentive on opportunity,</text><text start="2481.667" dur="1.266">and that&apos;s the kind of Silicon Valley</text><text start="2482.933" dur="1.427">move fast and break things motto.</text><text start="2484.36" dur="1.262">- [Zubin] Yup.

physics, and et cetera,</text><text start="2662.649" dur="1.894">and then the biophysics to say,</text><text start="2664.543" dur="2.45">well, how much increased
radiation of what type</text><text start="2666.993" dur="1.364">is gonna create how much mutation</text><text start="2668.357" dur="2.641">to then be able to weigh
against the difficulty</text><text start="2670.998" dur="1.503">of the farmers not losing their jobs,</text><text start="2672.501" dur="1.211">and those types of things.
- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="2673.712" dur="1.632">- [Daniel] And so, having created</text><text start="2675.344" dur="2.331">a very scientifically
advanced society also means</text><text start="2677.675" dur="2.385">that then you need a lot
of scientific insight</text><text start="2680.06" dur="1.307">to weigh in on the policy things.</text><text start="2681.367" dur="1.3">But that also means</text><text start="2682.667" dur="3.169">now people have to just
trust a priestly class.</text><text start="2685.836" dur="2.796">And, or they all have to
be adequately educated,</text><text start="2688.632" dur="1.706">and have access to all of those tools,</text><text start="2690.338" dur="2.26">and that, like adequately educated</text><text start="2692.598" dur="2.644">about virology, and nuclear
physics, and epidemiology,</text><text start="2695.242" dur="1.931">and climate, and et cetera-
- [Zubin] Not possible.</text><text start="2697.173" dur="2.298">- [Daniel] So you start to
reach information limits.</text><text start="2699.471" dur="1.372">So then you have to say, &quot;Well, fuck it,</text><text start="2700.843" dur="1.536">&quot;we need institutions that are trustworthy</text><text start="2702.379" dur="0.833">&quot;that can do that.&quot;</text><text start="2703.212" dur="1.041">Well, how do you get trust?</text><text start="2704.253" dur="2.654">How do you get everybody to
be able to trust institutions?</text><text start="2706.907" dur="4.035">Even if you had an institution
emerge that everyone trusted,</text><text start="2710.942" dur="1.244">&apos;cause it had some transparent way</text><text start="2712.186" dur="3.456">of being able to show real
good epistemic process,</text><text start="2715.642" dur="2.579">and lack of vested interest, and rigor,</text><text start="2718.221" dur="1.961">and checks and balances on power,</text><text start="2720.182" dur="2.184">and it became a kind of
legitimate authority,</text><text start="2722.366" dur="2.534">there&apos;s so much power to
being a legitimate authority,</text><text start="2724.9" dur="3.138">to being able to be the
arbiter of what is real</text><text start="2728.038" dur="2.095">that everyone who wants to
win at the game of power</text><text start="2730.133" dur="1.938">will have a maximum incentive
to try to corrupt that thing.</text><text start="2732.071" dur="1.151">- [Zubin] Hmm.</text><text start="2733.222" dur="1.553">- [Daniel] And so, then who wins?</text><text start="2734.775" dur="3.639">The scientists, and mathematicians,</text><text start="2738.414" dur="2.005">and philosophers focused on the thing,</text><text start="2740.419" dur="2.311">or the best players at the game of power,</text><text start="2742.73" dur="1.306">who are funding the thing,</text><text start="2744.036" dur="1.753">who have a maximum
incentive to start moving it</text><text start="2745.789" dur="1.423">in one particular direction?</text><text start="2747.212" dur="1.793">So how do you maintain
legitimate authority</text><text start="2749.005" dur="1.192">and have it not get captured?</text><text start="2750.197" dur="2.314">It&apos;s a real tricky thing.</text><text start="2752.511" dur="2.109">- [Zubin] Why does this
feel so familiar, Daniel,</text><text start="2754.62" dur="3.373">to a certain experience we&apos;ve
had over the past two years,</text><text start="2757.993" dur="2.761">where there are factions, who just,</text><text start="2760.754" dur="2.555">there&apos;s no way to even make sense,</text><text start="2763.309" dur="3.718">and anybody can hijack
the mantle of authority,</text><text start="2767.027" dur="2.597">including the mainstream,

to make sense of it?</text><text start="2781.168" dur="1.809">And this has been a fundamental problem.</text><text start="2782.977" dur="3.701">- [Daniel] Well, I&apos;ll just
say it live on your show.</text><text start="2786.678" dur="2.963">This is why, since you do such a good job</text><text start="2789.641" dur="2.58">of steel manning the
various points of view,</text><text start="2792.221" dur="2.096">being able to look at synthesis</text><text start="2794.317" dur="1.79">and antithesis with regard to COVID,</text><text start="2796.107" dur="2.098">I mean, thesis, antithesis,</text><text start="2798.205" dur="3.118">I think it would be fantastic for you</text><text start="2801.323" dur="2.575">to get leading earnest thinkers</text><text start="2803.898" dur="3.968">on both sides of the lab leak hypothesis,</text><text start="2807.866" dur="4.166">the vaccine mandate, the

identified what they agreed on,</text><text start="2818.44" dur="1.362">where they disagreed, what the basis</text><text start="2819.802" dur="2.468">of that disagreement was, what
it would take to resolve it</text><text start="2822.27" dur="2.617">that used really, that
oriented away from rhetoric</text><text start="2824.887" dur="2.458">and towards good formal methodology,</text><text start="2827.345" dur="3.065">and that everybody got to watch and see.</text><text start="2830.41" dur="1.642">I think that would be amazing,</text><text start="2832.052" dur="1.427">and I think you&apos;re the right guy to do it.</text><text start="2833.479" dur="1.617">- [Zubin] How dare you, number one, okay?</text><text start="2835.096" dur="3.442">Number two, what you&apos;re
describing is a solution,</text><text start="2838.538" dur="2.172">is one solution to this
sense-making crisis,</text><text start="2840.71" dur="2.955">which I think I feel very
strongly about as well, this idea,</text><text start="2843.665" dur="1.651">and you used a term that
I think we should explain,</text><text start="2845.316" dur="1.04">steel manning.</text><text start="2846.356" dur="1.344">You said steel manning.</text><text start="2847.7" dur="2.745">So it probably behooves us to understand</text><text start="2850.445" dur="1.208">what a straw man is,</text><text start="2851.653" dur="1.177">and then we can talk about a steel man.</text><text start="2852.83" dur="2.332">So very quickly, a straw
man is where you take</text><text start="2855.162" dur="2.886">an opponent&apos;s argument,
and you actually distort it</text><text start="2858.048" dur="2.95">in a way that you, and you can correct me</text><text start="2860.998" dur="1.949">if I&apos;m explaining this wrong,
and you put it out there,</text><text start="2862.947" dur="1.585">and go, &quot;Well, see, what they&apos;re saying is</text><text start="2864.532" dur="3.393">&quot;that they wanna kill all
kids by not vaccinating them.&quot;</text><text start="2867.925" dur="0.881">That&apos;s called a straw man,</text><text start="2868.806" dur="1.632">&apos;cause you&apos;re building the
straw man, then you attack it,</text><text start="2870.438" dur="1.469">&apos;cause it&apos;s easy to attack, right?</text><text start="2871.907" dur="2.332">So it&apos;s misunderstanding, or
purposefully misrepresenting</text><text start="2874.239" dur="1.921">what they&apos;re saying to create a straw man.</text><text start="2876.16" dur="2.173">A steel man, on the
other hand, is actually</text><text start="2878.333" dur="3.459">deeply re-conveying what the argument is</text><text start="2881.792" dur="2.353">in very clear terms to
where even the people</text><text start="2884.145" dur="0.939">who believe this argument are like,</text><text start="2885.084" dur="1.468">&quot;Yeah, you nailed it,
that&apos;s what we&apos;re saying.&quot;</text><text start="2886.552" dur="1.222">- [Daniel] Yeah.</text><text start="2887.774" dur="3.078">Straw man&apos;s where you are obviously</text><text start="2890.852" dur="2.279">just putting them down
and being pejorative,</text><text start="2893.131" dur="4.198">appeal to your own base,
but that&apos;s about it.</text><text start="2897.329" dur="2.24">The worst straw mans are
the ones that look like</text><text start="2899.569" dur="1.869">they&apos;re steel manning,
but they aren&apos;t, right?</text><text start="2901.438" dur="2.694">You say, &quot;Well, it&apos;s
understandable why such-and-such,</text><text start="2904.132" dur="1.357">&quot;and why they would think this,</text><text start="2905.489" dur="1.322">&quot;and they care about this and this,&quot;</text><text start="2906.811" dur="1.473">and it seems like you&apos;re empathizing,</text><text start="2908.284" dur="1.857">but it&apos;s a faux empathy,
&apos;cause what you&apos;re doing is</text><text start="2910.141" dur="1.902">setting up what looks like you empathize,</text><text start="2912.043" dur="1.733">so that you&apos;re setting up what looks like</text><text start="2913.776" dur="2.347">a solid understanding of the thesis,</text><text start="2916.123" dur="2.636">so that then when you
critique and take it down,</text><text start="2918.759" dur="1.743">people will assume that
you understand it well,</text><text start="2920.502" dur="3.049">except you constructed it in
a way that looked earnest,</text><text start="2923.551" dur="2.127">wasn&apos;t, and had weakness in it, right?</text><text start="2925.678" dur="3.218">So the faux steel man straw man is</text><text start="2928.896" dur="2.781">the most common dreadful one.
- [Zubin] Uh-huh.</text><text start="2931.677" dur="1.605">- [Daniel] Real steel
manning is where someone</text><text start="2933.282" dur="2.916">who has actual expertise
and care on the other side</text><text start="2936.198" dur="1.376">would say, &quot;I have nothing to add.&quot;</text><text start="2937.574" dur="1.611">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] Like you actually</text><text start="2939.185" dur="1.158">comprehensively did the thing.</text><text start="2940.343" dur="1.105">- [Zubin] You got it good, yeah,</text><text start="2941.448" dur="2.671">and that&apos;s important,
because first of all,</text><text start="2944.119" dur="2.249">then it eliminates the straw man effect</text><text start="2946.368" dur="2.745">where you&apos;re deliberately
weakening the opponent&apos;s argument</text><text start="2949.113" dur="3.032">by misrepresenting it, and ad hominem-ing,</text><text start="2952.145" dur="1.359">and all of the other stuff that you might</text><text start="2953.504" dur="2.363">throw into the straw man cocktail.</text><text start="2955.867" dur="1.278">And it shows that you actually understand</text><text start="2957.145" dur="1.88">what they&apos;re saying, which
means you already have</text><text start="2959.025" dur="3.161">some degree of empathy
with what they&apos;re doing,</text><text start="2962.186" dur="1.913">which is important, I think.</text><text start="2964.099" dur="1.667">- [Daniel] Yeah, I mean,
it does several things.</text><text start="2965.766" dur="1.985">It communicates enough respect</text><text start="2967.751" dur="2.265">for another fellow human being, or tribe,</text><text start="2970.016" dur="0.833">or group of people that you-</text><text start="2970.849" dur="0.929">- [Zubin] Assumes good
intent, too, probably-</text><text start="2971.778" dur="2.439">- [Daniel] You took the time
to see what they were saying,</text><text start="2974.217" dur="2.65">and it shows that what you say</text><text start="2976.867" dur="1.674">doesn&apos;t need to be dismissed instantly,</text><text start="2978.541" dur="1.512">as you didn&apos;t get where
they were coming from first.</text><text start="2980.053" dur="1.601">- [Zubin] Right, which is important, yeah.</text><text start="2981.654" dur="0.833">- [Daniel] And this is one,</text><text start="2982.487" dur="3.083">like democracy requires this process.</text><text start="2987.296" dur="2.143">Democracy, like modern
democracies, the US,</text><text start="2989.439" dur="1.854">and other kind of modern
European democracies,</text><text start="2991.293" dur="2.975">emerged out out of kind
of European Enlightenment,</text><text start="2994.268" dur="3.427">cultural enlightenment, and
this is why the founders</text><text start="2997.695" dur="2.257">in the US said, &quot;This system only works</text><text start="2999.952" dur="2.302">&quot;with a comprehensively
educated citizenry.&quot;</text><text start="3002.254" dur="1.648">And George Washington said,</text><text start="3003.902" dur="2.931">&quot;It&apos;s the primary aim of the
federal government to ensure</text><text start="3006.833" dur="2.509">&quot;the comprehensive education
in the science of government</text><text start="3009.342" dur="1.375">&quot;of every single citizen,&quot;</text><text start="3010.717" dur="1.356">science of government meaning everything</text><text start="3012.073" dur="1.524">you would need to understand to know</text><text start="3013.597" dur="1.617">how to do collective choice-making well.</text><text start="3015.214" dur="2.348">So the difficulties of game
theory and vested interest,</text><text start="3017.562" dur="1.771">economics, history, all those things,</text><text start="3019.333" dur="1.655">comprehensive education of every citizen</text><text start="3020.988" dur="1.312">in science of government
is the number one goal</text><text start="3022.3" dur="1.21">of the federal government,</text><text start="3023.51" dur="1.997">because if the number
one goal is rule of law,</text><text start="3025.507" dur="1.057">you can do it with a police state.</text><text start="3026.564" dur="1.388">If the number one goal is
to protect the boundaries,</text><text start="3027.952" dur="2.33">you can do it with a
military dictatorship.</text><text start="3030.282" dur="1.557">If you have the number one goal of being</text><text start="3031.839" dur="1.524">anything other than the
comprehensive education</text><text start="3033.363" dur="1.823">of every single citizen,
it won&apos;t be a democracy,</text><text start="3035.186" dur="1.202">&apos;cause democracy&apos;s very fragile,</text><text start="3036.388" dur="1.863">and requires that kind of thing,</text><text start="3038.251" dur="2.346">and it requires not only
that everyone can make sense</text><text start="3040.597" dur="1.78">of third-person reality together,</text><text start="3042.377" dur="1.174">apply the philosophy of science,</text><text start="3043.551" dur="1.412">and kind of natural philosophy,</text><text start="3044.963" dur="1.8">but that they can make sense
of each other&apos;s positions</text><text start="3046.763" dur="2.566">and value systems well, which
is the good faith discourse,</text><text start="3049.329" dur="1.67">the empathy, the Hegelian dialectic.</text><text start="3050.999" dur="3.028">Can I really argue your position well?</text><text start="3054.027" dur="2.475">Without that, democracy has no chance.</text><text start="3056.502" dur="3.123">And so, when people have
made their fellow countrymen</text><text start="3059.625" dur="4.085">the primary enemy, they are
actually, in the short-term,</text><text start="3063.71" dur="2.063">they think they&apos;re trying
to win a battle about COVID,</text><text start="3065.773" dur="1.525">or climate change, or systemic racism,</text><text start="3067.298" dur="0.891">or whatever the thing is.</text><text start="3068.189" dur="1.954">What they&apos;re actually
doing is waging a war</text><text start="3070.143" dur="2.454">against democratic process writ large,</text><text start="3072.597" dur="3.616">where as you&apos;re making
your primary countrymen</text><text start="3076.213" dur="3.533">the primary enemy, where all of the energy</text><text start="3079.746" dur="1.538">within that system goes to infighting,</text><text start="3081.284" dur="2.069">and then you elect more
polarized representatives,</text><text start="3083.353" dur="1.668">who create more gridlock,</text><text start="3085.021" dur="1.783">authoritarian countries
are just gonna do better</text><text start="3086.804" dur="1.414">geopolitically across every way.</text><text start="3088.218" dur="1.503">And then you&apos;re actually,</text><text start="3089.721" dur="2.674">what you&apos;re really fighting for
is the authoritarian process</text><text start="3092.395" dur="2.14">to have more global influence
over the 21st century.</text><text start="3094.535" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="3095.368" dur="1.837">We&apos;re fighting for China, basically.</text><text start="3097.205" dur="3.948">- [Daniel] So really, the
democratic process requires</text><text start="3101.153" dur="2.772">an epistemic commons, shared sense-making,</text><text start="3103.925" dur="2.385">and shared meaning-making to
inform shared choice-making.</text><text start="3106.31" dur="2.369">Democracy is a shared
choice-making process.</text><text start="3108.679" dur="2.227">But that means that we
have to have some process</text><text start="3110.906" dur="1.751">to talk about what is-</text><text start="3112.657" dur="1.722">- [Zubin] Right, sense-making, right.</text><text start="3114.379" dur="1.727">- [Daniel] And some process
to talk about what do we want,</text><text start="3116.106" dur="1.947">and I have to be able to
understand the thing that you want</text><text start="3118.053" dur="2.083">and understand that just
fucking you with the thing,</text><text start="3120.136" dur="1.221">you don&apos;t stop being a political actor,</text><text start="3121.357" dur="1.603">and then you&apos;re gonna act
even harder next time.</text><text start="3122.96" dur="1.453">We&apos;re just gonna escalate arms race.</text><text start="3124.413" dur="1.114">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] So how do we make</text><text start="3125.527" dur="2.612">compromises that address
what everybody wants?</text><text start="3128.139" dur="2.024">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] And so,</text><text start="3130.163" dur="2.25">the bad faith argumentation</text><text start="3133.348" dur="2.794">destroys the social contract,</text><text start="3136.142" dur="3.121">and the epistemic commons,
destroys democracy.</text><text start="3139.263" dur="2.331">Good faith argumentation
is not sufficient,</text><text start="3141.594" dur="1.706">but is necessary.</text><text start="3143.3" dur="1.331">And so, the steel man is the beginning</text><text start="3144.631" dur="2.488">of a good faith argument.</text><text start="3147.119" dur="1.418">- [Zubin] Brilliant, and I&apos;ll say this.</text><text start="3148.537" dur="3.127">If you look at any comment
on YouTube (laughs)</text><text start="3151.664" dur="2.67">on, say, any of my videos, you can find</text><text start="3154.334" dur="3.606">accusations of bad faith,
accusations of capture,</text><text start="3157.94" dur="2.964">accusations of all kinds of
straw manning of my arguments,</text><text start="3160.904" dur="1.736">and things like that,

are being addicted to it?</text><text start="3192.104" dur="1.917">How then is it creating</text><text start="3195.534" dur="1.645">civilization-level risks in us,</text><text start="3197.179" dur="4.186">including the simple
question of are we generating</text><text start="3201.365" dur="1.967">a ton of, like, we talked
about this offline,</text><text start="3203.332" dur="4.063">a ton of subclinical mental

got like at least three</text><text start="3212.328" dur="1.688">really important directions to go here,</text><text start="3214.016" dur="2.025">the subclinical mental illness,</text><text start="3216.041" dur="3.13">or kind of like ubiquitous psychopathology</text><text start="3219.171" dur="3.033">of the whole population that
is not innate to being human,</text><text start="3222.204" dur="3.833">but a epiphenomena of
the civilization design,</text><text start="3227.766" dur="4.843">and honestly ubiquitous
subclinical psychopathology</text><text start="3232.609" dur="2.673">and physiopathology, both, right?</text><text start="3235.282" dur="1.773">- [Zubin] Mental and physical illness.</text><text start="3237.055" dur="2.516">- [Daniel] Yeah.
- [Zubin] And</text><text start="3239.571" dur="2.359">when you say subclinical,
meaning it hasn&apos;t quite reached</text><text start="3241.93" dur="1.042">the threshold-
- [Daniel] Diagnosable.</text><text start="3242.972" dur="0.984">- [Zubin] Being diagnosed-</text><text start="3243.956" dur="1.032">- [Daniel] But in the direction of.</text><text start="3244.988" dur="1.409">- [Zubin] In the direction of,
and the other thing you said,</text><text start="3246.397" dur="2.209">just to tie it in, is
that the Anthropocene,</text><text start="3248.606" dur="4.044">this era of this technology
feeding back to us,</text><text start="3252.65" dur="1.09">is generating this.</text><text start="3253.74" dur="2.266">This is not something innate to us.</text><text start="3256.006" dur="0.856">- [Daniel] Yeah.
- [Zubin] It&apos;s a feedback</text><text start="3256.862" dur="0.833">with this technology-</text><text start="3257.695" dur="0.834">- [Daniel] Okay, so that was one thing.</text><text start="3258.529" dur="2.602">The other is what does social media do</text><text start="3261.131" dur="2.823">that is intrinsically destructive
to the social contract,</text><text start="3263.954" dur="1.888">the epistemic commons, democracy itself,</text><text start="3265.842" dur="2.616">and maybe other stuff?
- [Zubin] Mmm-hmm.</text><text start="3268.458" dur="1.467">- [Daniel] And that gets
to, I was starting to give</text><text start="3269.925" dur="1.78">the example of there&apos;s a
unique category of tech,</text><text start="3271.705" dur="1.161">which is self-replicating tech,</text><text start="3272.866" dur="2.322">just to basically say there&apos;s
a few novel categories of tech</text><text start="3275.188" dur="0.888">that exponential tech makes.</text><text start="3276.076" dur="1.869">The one I wanted to get
into was social media,</text><text start="3277.945" dur="1.164">why it&apos;s a unique category of tech,</text><text start="3279.109" dur="0.883">so I&apos;ll add that in there.</text><text start="3279.992" dur="0.926">- [Zubin] Let&apos;s do that, uh-huh.</text><text start="3280.918" dur="1.644">- [Daniel] But then the third
thing that you brought up,</text><text start="3282.562" dur="2.577">which was why do those comments</text><text start="3285.139" dur="3.228">that are cynical on you emerge the most,</text><text start="3288.367" dur="0.878">let me do that one real quick.</text><text start="3289.245" dur="1.951">- [Zubin] Yeah, let&apos;s do that.</text><text start="3291.196" dur="2.363">By the way, I never write shit
down when I&apos;m interviewing,</text><text start="3293.559" dur="2.126">but with you, it&apos;s like
we&apos;re doing all this stuff,</text><text start="3295.685" dur="1.473">I have to write it down, or
we&apos;ll never come back to it.</text><text start="3297.158" dur="1.434">(Zubin laughs)</text><text start="3298.592" dur="1.332">- [Daniel] They&apos;re all good,
and they&apos;re all interconnected.</text><text start="3299.924" dur="1.272">We could take any of the
directions to begin with-</text><text start="3301.196" dur="0.895">- [Zubin] Perfect, yeah, hit me</text><text start="3302.091" dur="1.661">with the cynical comment piece.</text><text start="3303.752" dur="5.0">- [Daniel] So kind of drawing
on the pre/trans framework</text><text start="3308.838" dur="2.333">that Ken Wilber popularized,</text><text start="3313.44" dur="1.445">I won&apos;t even bother
constructing that right now.</text><text start="3314.885" dur="0.833">People can look it up.</text><text start="3315.718" dur="1.163">I&apos;ll just say-</text><text start="3316.881" dur="1.629">- [Zubin] I&apos;ve talked
about it before, too, yeah.</text><text start="3318.51" dur="2.062">- [Daniel] One kind of
model of the development</text><text start="3320.572" dur="2.257">people go through in terms of game theory,</text><text start="3322.829" dur="1.486">like their own intuition of game theory,</text><text start="3324.315" dur="2.947">you could call naive,
cynical, post-cynical</text><text start="3327.262" dur="2.092">as a developmental
process in the direction</text><text start="3329.354" dur="3.167">of increased capacity to do citizenry.</text><text start="3337.366" dur="2.371">Naive is where you assume good intent</text><text start="3339.737" dur="1.997">on other people&apos;s parts
as a kind of default.</text><text start="3341.734" dur="2.058">You assume that what people are saying is</text><text start="3343.792" dur="2.365">generally what they believe,</text><text start="3346.157" dur="2.958">and that other people&apos;s
interior experience is probably</text><text start="3349.115" dur="0.833">a lot like yours,</text><text start="3349.948" dur="3.264">and that where fucked up things
are happening is probably</text><text start="3353.212" dur="2.314">mostly because of mistakes,
and things like that.</text><text start="3355.526" dur="2.917">And if you interact with the world,</text><text start="3359.473" dur="1.473">and particularly systems of power enough,</text><text start="3360.946" dur="2.058">that will become destroyed in you, right?</text><text start="3363.004" dur="4.111">And then the naivete will crash
upon the rocks of reality,</text><text start="3367.115" dur="2.308">and then you&apos;ll move into a cynical place,</text><text start="3369.423" dur="2.194">where you realize</text><text start="3371.617" dur="1.743">how much ladder-climbing,</text><text start="3373.36" dur="1.871">how much of virtue is virtue signaling,</text><text start="3375.231" dur="4.631">how much of communication
as a whole is strategic,</text><text start="3379.862" dur="1.097">where someone is saying something</text><text start="3380.959" dur="0.992">for the effect they want it to have,</text><text start="3381.951" dur="2.611">not just for what they maximally believe,</text><text start="3384.562" dur="1.834">how much of the epistemic
commons is the result</text><text start="3386.396" dur="1.999">of everyone&apos;s agentic desire to make</text><text start="3388.395" dur="2.714">other people believe stuff,
rather than just what is true,</text><text start="3391.109" dur="1.012">all those types of things, right-</text><text start="3392.121" dur="0.905">- [Zubin] And by the way-
- [Daniel] Get cynical.</text><text start="3393.026" dur="1.23">- [Zubin] And when you
say epistemic commons,</text><text start="3394.256" dur="3.627">you&apos;re talking about the where,
how we even get information</text><text start="3397.883" dur="1.734">by epistemic, yeah.
- [Daniel] Yeah.</text><text start="3399.617" dur="1.586">We could call it the knowledge commons,</text><text start="3401.203" dur="2.24">which is just the available information</text><text start="3403.443" dur="1.208">that we can all look at.
- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="3404.651" dur="0.833">- [Daniel] But it&apos;s
not just the knowledge,</text><text start="3405.484" dur="2.862">because the methodology that produced it,</text><text start="3408.346" dur="2.482">right, the epistemic
process, is gonna be key</text><text start="3410.828" dur="4.532">to whether or not I believe
it, how I factor it,</text><text start="3415.36" dur="2.052">all those types of things, and
then what do I do with that?</text><text start="3417.412" dur="2.26">There&apos;s an epistemic process
of how do I factor that data</text><text start="3419.672" dur="2.601">to actually come up with
forecasts, and conclusions.</text><text start="3422.273" dur="2.94">And so, the data is not
that interesting by itself.</text><text start="3425.213" dur="1.396">The entire epistemic commons,</text><text start="3426.609" dur="2.943">how do we collectively make
sense of the world together?</text><text start="3429.552" dur="2.149">- [Zubin] Got it, got
it, so you had the naive,</text><text start="3431.701" dur="1.209">then you had the cynical.</text><text start="3432.91" dur="3.235">- [Daniel] Yeah, now, in cynical,</text><text start="3436.145" dur="3.601">so you read Machiavelli, and
you get a good description</text><text start="3439.746" dur="2.772">of the cynical, and that
that type of court dynamic</text><text start="3442.518" dur="1.306">is actually playing out.</text><text start="3443.824" dur="2.532">And typically around any center of power,</text><text start="3446.356" dur="1.365">there&apos;s something like court dynamics.</text><text start="3447.721" dur="1.472">Around any very wealthy person,</text><text start="3449.193" dur="1.37">you watch in their social circle,</text><text start="3450.563" dur="1.098">and there&apos;s something like court dynamics.</text><text start="3451.661" dur="0.886">- [Zubin] Yes, we&apos;ve all seen it.</text><text start="3452.547" dur="1.796">We see it at CDC, we see it at FDA,</text><text start="3454.343" dur="1.827">we see it every big institution.</text><text start="3456.17" dur="1.768">- [Daniel] And so, then you
end up getting situations,</text><text start="3457.938" dur="3.577">where whoever is in the
position of most power will get</text><text start="3461.515" dur="2.292">a distortion bubble of the
type of feedback they get</text><text start="3463.807" dur="1.548">because people want something from them,</text><text start="3465.355" dur="2.162">so there are certain
types of disagreements</text><text start="3467.517" dur="0.833">that won&apos;t happen.</text><text start="3468.35" dur="2.868">So then you&apos;ll get the
propagation of their own biases,</text><text start="3471.218" dur="1.078">and other people confirming it,</text><text start="3472.296" dur="1.508">and all kind of nonsense like that, right?</text><text start="3473.804" dur="1.944">- [Zubin] The Steve Jobs
reality distortion field</text><text start="3475.748" dur="0.833">type of deal.</text><text start="3476.581" dur="0.878">Actually, that&apos;s-
- [Daniel] There&apos;s different</text><text start="3477.459" dur="1.178">kinds of reality distortion.</text><text start="3478.637" dur="2.826">This is one kind of vested
interest reality distortion,</text><text start="3481.463" dur="3.035">and if you want an introduction
to how to think cynically,</text><text start="3484.498" dur="1.91">&quot;The 48 Laws of Power&quot; is
probably the best you can get.</text><text start="3486.408" dur="1.732">- [Zubin] &quot;48 Laws of

- [Zubin] Got it, okay.</text><text start="3489.548" dur="2.331">- [Daniel] And he&apos;s taking Machiavelli,</text><text start="3491.879" dur="3.599">but also Sun Tzu, and von Clausewitz,</text><text start="3495.478" dur="2.372">and most of the kind
of strategic thinkers,</text><text start="3497.85" dur="2.492">and giving a summary of how
does the game of power work.</text><text start="3500.342" dur="0.931">- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="3501.273" dur="1.417">- [Daniel] And...</text><text start="3504.442" dur="2.522">And you know you&apos;re in the cynical</text><text start="3506.964" dur="2.114">if you say something like,</text><text start="3509.078" dur="1.945">&quot;If you don&apos;t know who the
sucker in the room is, it&apos;s you.&quot;</text><text start="3511.023" dur="1.83">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] Right?</text><text start="3512.853" dur="1.663">Because you assume that the game of power</text><text start="3514.516" dur="1.543">is happening everywhere,
there is some suckers,</text><text start="3516.059" dur="2.406">they&apos;re getting taken
advantage of, et cetera.</text><text start="3518.465" dur="1.594">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] I think the key is</text><text start="3520.059" dur="2.365">that there is such a
thing as post-cynical,</text><text start="3522.424" dur="0.919">and the cynical would say,</text><text start="3523.343" dur="3.205">&quot;The only thing that is
not cynical is naive,&quot;</text><text start="3526.548" dur="2.044">because typically, things
don&apos;t even have an awareness</text><text start="3528.592" dur="2.107">of a developmental stage
that is beyond them-</text><text start="3530.699" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] That&apos;s right-
- [Daniel] So that&apos;s where</text><text start="3531.532" dur="1.87">you get mistakes-
- [Zubin] Blindness, yeah.</text><text start="3533.402" dur="2.917">- [Daniel] So the-post-cynical says</text><text start="3538.181" dur="3.564">it is possible to authentically
care about something</text><text start="3541.745" dur="1.841">more than just self-interest</text><text start="3543.586" dur="1.147">in a way that you&apos;re actually willing</text><text start="3544.733" dur="1.555">to make real sacrifice for,</text><text start="3546.288" dur="2.072">and that they&apos;re are
other people who also can,</text><text start="3548.36" dur="2.796">and that authentic relationships
of trust can be formed.</text><text start="3551.156" dur="1.059">- [Zubin] Hmm.</text><text start="3552.215" dur="1.434">- [Daniel] So I couldn&apos;t be post-cynical</text><text start="3553.649" dur="1.291">if I didn&apos;t believe that
there were other people</text><text start="3554.94" dur="1.59">that could be post-cynical.</text><text start="3556.53" dur="1.454">Right, &apos;cause I have
to believe I can have-</text><text start="3557.984" dur="1.177">- [Zubin] They need to be there.</text><text start="3559.161" dur="0.833">- [Daniel] Of trust.</text><text start="3559.994" dur="1.041">- [Zubin] If everybody else is cynical,</text><text start="3561.035" dur="1.252">you can&apos;t, there&apos;s no trust.</text><text start="3562.287" dur="1.879">If everybody else is naive,
there&apos;s no, you can&apos;t do it.</text><text start="3564.166" dur="1.092">- [Daniel] If they&apos;re just naive-</text><text start="3565.258" dur="1.491">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] I can&apos;t trust &apos;em</text><text start="3566.749" dur="1.29">that much, because on accident,</text><text start="3568.039" dur="1.358">they&apos;ll get played by the cynical people,</text><text start="3569.397" dur="1.121">and even though they&apos;re
trying to be loyal,</text><text start="3570.518" dur="1.228">the whole thing will still get fucked up-</text><text start="3571.746" dur="1.288">- [Zubin] It&apos;ll fall apart-
- [Daniel] I have to know</text><text start="3573.034" dur="3.111">that the other people have
an immunity to that process,</text><text start="3576.145" dur="2.56">that they&apos;re aware of it, but
they are also not bound to it.</text><text start="3578.705" dur="1.324">This is in the world, but not of it,</text><text start="3580.029" dur="1.304">right?
- [Zubin] Ah.</text><text start="3581.333" dur="1.302">- [Daniel] And so, to be post-cynical,</text><text start="3582.635" dur="1.62">you have to know that other
people can be post-cynical,</text><text start="3584.255" dur="1.814">and then you have to be able to know how,</text><text start="3586.069" dur="3.34">what is a legitimate basis of
trust, and how do I know that?</text><text start="3589.409" dur="1.884">How do I sense that?</text><text start="3591.293" dur="2.25">And so, what I would say is</text><text start="3595.355" dur="3.083">post-cynical good faith communication</text><text start="3600.226" dur="3.095">is necessary for something like</text><text start="3603.321" dur="1.773">the continuation of anything</text><text start="3605.094" dur="1.712">that&apos;s at all democratic, or republic.</text><text start="3606.806" dur="1.725">Anything that has participatory governance</text><text start="3608.531" dur="2.14">and is not just the people
being ruled requires</text><text start="3610.671" dur="2.031">the people being able to develop that.</text><text start="3612.702" dur="3.17">So that has to become the center
of the values of a culture</text><text start="3615.872" dur="1.448">that then develops that in people</text><text start="3617.32" dur="1.59">and checks it and reinforces it.</text><text start="3618.91" dur="2.779">- [Zubin] So does a post-cynical,
this is fascinating.</text><text start="3621.689" dur="2.5">Does a post-cynical standpoint</text><text start="3625.593" dur="2.667">require the sort of transcending</text><text start="3629.33" dur="2.803">and including the naive
and the cynical standpoint?</text><text start="3632.133" dur="0.833">- [Daniel] Of course.</text><text start="3632.966" dur="1.539">- [Zubin] So you have
to be able to understand</text><text start="3634.505" dur="3.002">and inhabit the naive and the cynical</text><text start="3637.507" dur="1.638">to develop a post-cynical.</text><text start="3639.145" dur="2.95">- [Daniel] In the same
way that a metamodern,</text><text start="3642.095" dur="2.718">or an integral, or a
post-postmodern system actually has</text><text start="3644.813" dur="2.503">to understand postmodernist
critiques on modernity well,</text><text start="3647.316" dur="1.687">and then also understand
modernity well, right?</text><text start="3649.003" dur="0.833">You have to understand</text><text start="3649.836" dur="1.511">the philosophy of science-
- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="3651.347" dur="1.564">- [Daniel] And the Hegelian dialectic.</text><text start="3652.911" dur="1.496">You have to understand
the postmodern critique</text><text start="3654.407" dur="1.602">of why there is no objective fact.</text><text start="3656.009" dur="1.334">- [Zubin] Right.
- [Daniel] And why there is</text><text start="3657.343" dur="1.455">no objective absolute perspective,</text><text start="3658.798" dur="1.817">and claiming it&apos;s probably
some type of imperialism,</text><text start="3660.615" dur="2.876">or power game in that you
can&apos;t separate game of power</text><text start="3663.491" dur="2.016">from the propagation of ideas.
- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="3665.507" dur="1.813">- [Daniel] And then not
just leave it there,</text><text start="3667.32" dur="1.992">&apos;cause that&apos;s an untenable
place to leave it,</text><text start="3669.312" dur="2.846">and say how do we take that
critique as a refinement,</text><text start="3672.158" dur="1.697">&apos;cause that&apos;s a deconstruction process.</text><text start="3673.855" dur="1.916">How do we take that
deconstruction as a refinement</text><text start="3675.771" dur="1.336">to a constructive process,</text><text start="3677.107" dur="1.334">which means everybody
can get on the same page</text><text start="3678.441" dur="1.714">with something other

is the game of power,</text><text start="3681.58" dur="2.833">and all truth claims have no basis</text><text start="3686.014" dur="2.151">other than claimant power,</text><text start="3688.165" dur="2.243">then what you&apos;re actually
doing is exalting power</text><text start="3690.408" dur="1.668">as the only possible thing,</text><text start="3692.076" dur="1.791">and that thing actually
self-terminates, right?</text><text start="3693.867" dur="1.193">A situation where everyone is</text><text start="3695.06" dur="0.927">just playing the game of power,</text><text start="3695.987" dur="1.933">where that means that

doing defect-defect leads</text><text start="3820.436" dur="2.607">to catastrophe for everybody.
- [Zubin] Yeah, yeah,</text><text start="3823.043" dur="2.473">and that prisoner&apos;s dilemma
we&apos;ll talk about another time,</text><text start="3825.516" dur="2.75">but the basic idea is
that this is game theory,</text><text start="3828.266" dur="4.069">and this, so this is
fascinating, because again,</text><text start="3832.335" dur="3.386">all these pieces that we&apos;re
talking about are actually,</text><text start="3835.721" dur="1.914">and I&apos;ve never really fragmented them</text><text start="3837.635" dur="2.763">into these little bits that
are actually very helpful</text><text start="3840.398" dur="1.494">to make explicit.</text><text start="3841.892" dur="2.81">This post-cynical idea of discourse,</text><text start="3844.702" dur="1.817">it is central to what I call alt-middle,</text><text start="3846.519" dur="1.908">which is really, again, it&apos;s integral.</text><text start="3848.427" dur="1.081">It&apos;s an integral perspective.</text><text start="3849.508" dur="1.809">It&apos;s saying okay, how
are we gonna make sense?</text><text start="3851.317" dur="0.968">How are we gonna have dialogue?</text><text start="3852.285" dur="3.159">How are we gonna try to find
our way through the morass</text><text start="3855.444" dur="2.579">of what is, and what ought to be</text><text start="3858.023" dur="2.889">if we can&apos;t even agree that

their environment, right?</text><text start="3968.377" dur="2.341">A particular mutation

the tool of clothes on,</text><text start="3987.481" dur="2.657">and go to a cold place,

very short number of bits</text><text start="4227.964" dur="1.821">with some kind of dopamine hit associated.</text><text start="4229.785" dur="1.331">I&apos;ve got some pictures, images, whatever,</text><text start="4231.116" dur="1.358">not that many bits, then the next one,</text><text start="4232.474" dur="1.453">nothing like very long text fields.</text><text start="4233.927" dur="1.427">Somebody&apos;s gonna bounce on that.</text><text start="4235.354" dur="1.84">So it shortens attention span,</text><text start="4237.194" dur="3.561">and just hits a lot of
hypernormal stimuli,</text><text start="4240.755" dur="3.417">which means then normal stimuli
don&apos;t do anything, right?</text><text start="4244.172" dur="2.607">Once you&apos;ve watched enough of
the super airbrushed pictures,</text><text start="4246.779" dur="2.134">then normal women start
to look less pretty.</text><text start="4248.913" dur="2.142">- [Zubin] Once you&apos;ve
seen enough porn, yeah.</text><text start="4251.055" dur="2.157">- [Daniel] Then you can
actually fetishize formally it,</text><text start="4253.212" dur="1.669">meaning you can&apos;t eroticize without it.</text><text start="4254.881" dur="1.424">- [Zubin] Right.
- [Daniel] In the same way</text><text start="4256.305" dur="2.092">that fruits and vegetables
don&apos;t taste good</text><text start="4258.397" dur="1.488">once you&apos;ve done too much McDonald&apos;s.</text><text start="4259.885" dur="2.203">- [Zubin] Right, or even
an Impossible Burger,</text><text start="4262.088" dur="1.053">which is apparently all vegetables,</text><text start="4263.141" dur="1.521">but tastes like crack to me.</text><text start="4264.662" dur="4.368">- [Daniel] So you&apos;re providing
a hypernormal stimuli</text><text start="4269.03" dur="2.499">that then desensitizes the receptor</text><text start="4271.529" dur="2.255">to normal stimuli, right?</text><text start="4273.784" dur="2.093">Which means that it&apos;s actually
decreasing the potential</text><text start="4275.877" dur="2.656">from happiness and contact
with the world, right?</text><text start="4278.533" dur="2.534">Now, you need a narrower thing
with higher amounts of it</text><text start="4281.067" dur="1.837">and saturation to be able
to get any effect at all-</text><text start="4282.904" dur="1.884">- [Zubin] The same level,
and not even the same level,</text><text start="4284.788" dur="1.667">sub-sub-level, yeah.</text><text start="4287.862" dur="1.333">- [Daniel] So...</text><text start="4290.614" dur="2.976">So social media does all those things,</text><text start="4293.59" dur="1.014">but one of the things it does</text><text start="4294.604" dur="1.512">in the customizing of it, right,</text><text start="4296.116" dur="2.046">the personalizing it to you,</text><text start="4298.162" dur="2.223">if this is starting when someone&apos;s a kid,</text><text start="4300.385" dur="3.22">they have this experience
that the world conforms itself</text><text start="4303.605" dur="2.516">to fit their preferences.
- [Zubin] Hmm.</text><text start="4306.121" dur="2.0">- [Daniel] In a way that</text><text start="4309.167" dur="3.087">no other previous technology</text><text start="4312.254" dur="2.387">would have ever had a corollary to.</text><text start="4314.641" dur="3.815">And so, if the whole time
I&apos;m on the digital world,</text><text start="4318.456" dur="2.664">it can, with very, it
takes very little action</text><text start="4321.12" dur="0.868">on my part, right?</text><text start="4321.988" dur="1.543">I push a button,</text><text start="4323.531" dur="2.34">with very good UX to change everything.</text><text start="4325.871" dur="3.139">So I get a lot of change
from very little action,</text><text start="4329.01" dur="3.287">and it&apos;s all conforming to
personalize itself to me.</text><text start="4332.297" dur="2.389">The contact with the world of atoms</text><text start="4334.686" dur="1.833">and in the world of real
people&apos;s gonna suck-</text><text start="4336.519" dur="4.294">- [Zubin] The world of remodeling
your house, for example.</text><text start="4340.813" dur="1.306">- [Daniel] Well, even remodeling my house,</text><text start="4342.119" dur="1.646">I&apos;m still, it&apos;s gonna take more work,</text><text start="4343.765" dur="2.02">but I&apos;m still trying to
personalize the world to me.</text><text start="4345.785" dur="1.863">- [Zubin] Right, but there&apos;s a challenge.</text><text start="4347.648" dur="2.631">In other words, the UX
on the social media app,</text><text start="4350.279" dur="2.152">you can personalize your
world with a couple clicks.</text><text start="4352.431" dur="1.93">- [Daniel] Way easier.</text><text start="4354.361" dur="2.509">But so much to say tribal dynamic</text><text start="4356.87" dur="1.764">that was an evolutionary process was</text><text start="4358.634" dur="1.451">nature is not modifying itself,</text><text start="4360.085" dur="2.081">what Eric Weinstein calls
contact with the unforgiving.</text><text start="4362.166" dur="1.396">It&apos;s not modifying itself to you at all.</text><text start="4363.562" dur="2.448">The rose is gonna fuckin&apos;
prick you if you touch it.</text><text start="4366.01" dur="3.453">So you have to modify yourself
to work with the environment,</text><text start="4369.463" dur="1.747">and you have to really modify yourself</text><text start="4371.21" dur="1.175">to work with the tribe, right?</text><text start="4372.385" dur="2.441">The tribe is not all going
to bend over backwards</text><text start="4374.826" dur="1.849">for whatever your particular
whim of the moment is.</text><text start="4376.675" dur="3.583">So is that conditioning
narcissism at scale</text><text start="4381.279" dur="1.955">generationally in a way
that nothing ever has</text><text start="4383.234" dur="2.09">(Zubin laughs)
along with addictiveness,</text><text start="4385.324" dur="3.139">short attention,
orientation to sanctimony,</text><text start="4388.463" dur="2.714">certainty, et cetera,
like those are really,</text><text start="4391.177" dur="2.003">so again, you take that humans are mold,</text><text start="4393.18" dur="1.738">like all animals are molded
by their environment.</text><text start="4394.918" dur="1.2">Humans change their environment,</text><text start="4396.118" dur="2.12">so we&apos;re more moldable to be able</text><text start="4398.238" dur="2.136">to become fit to new environments.</text><text start="4400.374" dur="2.044">We&apos;re making environments that
are more radically different</text><text start="4402.418" dur="1.677">than our evolutionary environments.</text><text start="4404.095" dur="1.787">Then we are becoming
the psychological result</text><text start="4405.882" dur="1.6">of those things,</text><text start="4407.482" dur="1.628">and then are those the kinds of people</text><text start="4409.11" dur="1.01">we wanna be?
- [Zubin] Okay.</text><text start="4410.12" dur="1.141">- [Daniel] Are those the kinds
of people we wanna create?</text><text start="4411.261" dur="3.083">- [Zubin] Okay, okay, so man, that&apos;s,</text><text start="4415.618" dur="3.0">this idea that we are in equilibrium</text><text start="4419.678" dur="2.07">in some way with our tribe,
with our environment,</text><text start="4421.748" dur="1.572">with our built environment,
with our technology,</text><text start="4423.32" dur="2.086">and it actually feeds back
into our own behaviors</text><text start="4425.406" dur="3.925">through these memetic
doses back and forth,</text><text start="4429.331" dur="2.506">it really cuts to the
heart of now are these,</text><text start="4431.837" dur="1.595">is this where we wanna go?</text><text start="4433.432" dur="1.671">Is this a civilization-level threat</text><text start="4435.103" dur="2.746">that we&apos;re developing
that self-terminates?</text><text start="4437.849" dur="2.256">And how does this relate
to something like, say,</text><text start="4440.105" dur="2.479">Jonathan Haidt&apos;s &quot;Coddling
of the American Mind&quot;</text><text start="4442.584" dur="3.652">with Lakoff talking about exactly this.</text><text start="4446.236" dur="5.0">We&apos;re now creating a generation
of, say, fragile children</text><text start="4451.478" dur="4.066">and adolescents who have more
diagnosable mental illness,</text><text start="4455.544" dur="4.921">who have more suicidality, if
not actual executed suicides,</text><text start="4460.465" dur="3.788">and more inability to
cope with the challenges</text><text start="4464.253" dur="2.37">that, say, the previous
generations did not have</text><text start="4466.623" dur="1.5">as much trouble with.</text><text start="4468.123" dur="1.708">Does this all kind of tie together?</text><text start="4469.831" dur="1.468">I&apos;m curious your thoughts on that.</text><text start="4471.299" dur="0.989">- [Daniel] Okay, so let&apos;s come back</text><text start="4472.288" dur="4.839">to this kind of ubiquitous
subclinical psychopathology.</text><text start="4477.127" dur="2.539">Just as a reference of, you know,</text><text start="4479.666" dur="3.355">what I mean when I say subclinical is</text><text start="4483.021" dur="4.414">let&apos;s say we&apos;re talking
about a nutrient deficiency.</text><text start="4487.435" dur="2.534">There is a clinical vitamin C
deficiency, which is scurvy,</text><text start="4489.969" dur="1.386">which is a really, really low level,</text><text start="4491.355" dur="1.493">meaning you&apos;re acutely dying-
- [Zubin] Arr!</text><text start="4492.848" dur="1.849">- [Daniel] Below that level-
- [Zubin] Scurvy knave.</text><text start="4494.697" dur="1.7">Yup, you&apos;re losing teeth, and all that.</text><text start="4496.397" dur="1.198">- [Daniel] But there is an ideal level,</text><text start="4497.595" dur="1.77">and there&apos;s a range in
between the ideal level</text><text start="4499.365" dur="1.03">and dying of scurvy.</text><text start="4500.395" dur="1.827">I would call that subclinical deficiency.</text><text start="4502.222" dur="1.088">- [Zubin] Yup.
- [Daniel] Even though</text><text start="4503.31" dur="1.112">it&apos;s within the healthy range,</text><text start="4504.422" dur="2.413">meaning not yet the formal disease.</text><text start="4506.835" dur="2.237">And so, I would say there is</text><text start="4509.072" dur="2.038">a subclinical nutrient deficiency</text><text start="4511.11" dur="3.528">that&apos;s pretty ubiquitous
across lots of things.</text><text start="4514.638" dur="1.636">There&apos;s an acute level of poisoning</text><text start="4516.274" dur="2.474">of a particular kind of petrol toxin,</text><text start="4518.748" dur="1.468">or heavy metal, or whatever,</text><text start="4520.216" dur="2.452">but then there&apos;s any level above</text><text start="4522.668" dur="2.395">the evolutionary environment&apos;s
non-exposure to it</text><text start="4525.063" dur="1.846">that is causing some
stress on the physiology</text><text start="4526.909" dur="1.681">that I would call subclinical toxicity.</text><text start="4528.59" dur="4.304">So the volatile organic compounds
coming out of the paint,</text><text start="4532.894" dur="2.505">and the carpet that are carcinogens,</text><text start="4535.399" dur="1.568">or neurotoxins, or whatever.</text><text start="4536.967" dur="2.218">So it&apos;s the idea that
you can have something</text><text start="4539.185" dur="5.0">that is disruptive to the ideal
homeodynamics of the system,</text><text start="4544.23" dur="0.98">but subclinical.</text><text start="4545.21" dur="2.171">It&apos;s not yet causing the acute pathology,</text><text start="4547.381" dur="2.421">but it&apos;s contributing to a causal cascade</text><text start="4549.802" dur="2.18">with a lot of other things
that can have an effect.</text><text start="4551.982" dur="2.113">So that&apos;s examples of
that physiologically.</text><text start="4554.095" dur="1.283">The same is true psychologically.</text><text start="4555.378" dur="2.833">So before someone has diagnosable,</text><text start="4560.319" dur="4.167">you know, serious depressive
disorder, they can be</text><text start="4565.605" dur="2.499">much more depressive than
would be an optimal state</text><text start="4568.104" dur="1.605">for someone, and we can
call it kind of subclinical.</text><text start="4569.709" dur="2.511">Before they have generalized
anxiety disorder diagnosably,</text><text start="4572.22" dur="2.15">they can have a lot
more background anxiety</text><text start="4574.37" dur="2.927">then is necessary for
the human experience.</text><text start="4577.297" dur="1.437">And the same is true for OCD,</text><text start="4578.734" dur="2.089">the same is true for complex PTSD, right?</text><text start="4580.823" dur="1.397">Complex PTSD, where you have</text><text start="4582.22" dur="3.063">kind of an excessive trigger response,</text><text start="4585.283" dur="2.142">sympathetic response to
some kind of trigger,</text><text start="4587.425" dur="2.593">but instead of an acute PTSD,
where that&apos;s on one event,</text><text start="4590.018" dur="1.399">it was a complex PTSD,</text><text start="4591.417" dur="2.549">meaning something that
occurred many times.</text><text start="4593.966" dur="1.602">I would say it&apos;s arguable</text><text start="4595.568" dur="4.31">that people have complex
PTSD on civilization, right?</text><text start="4599.878" dur="3.954">Like they have this kind of
continued trauma associated</text><text start="4603.832" dur="1.755">with lots of things that creates</text><text start="4605.587" dur="2.221">an increased sympathetic
response to lots of things.</text><text start="4607.808" dur="1.489">That is a pretty common phenomena, right?</text><text start="4609.297" dur="1.29">- [Zubin] And actually,
just look at the pandemic.</text><text start="4610.587" dur="1.637">I mean, this has been
happening throughout.</text><text start="4612.224" dur="1.407">You have this constant sort of fear,</text><text start="4613.631" dur="3.038">people doom scrolling, all the
stuff feeding back together,</text><text start="4616.669" dur="1.668">and then people afraid
to leave their house,</text><text start="4618.337" dur="2.218">people triple masking, and
then other people saying,</text><text start="4620.555" dur="3.519">&quot;I&apos;m afraid my liberties are
gone,&quot; and reacting that way.</text><text start="4624.074" dur="2.054">It is this kind of pandemic of subclinical</text><text start="4626.128" dur="3.126">and even clinical anxiety, depression.</text><text start="4629.254" dur="1.927">I don&apos;t know, I don&apos;t think
the narcissism component</text><text start="4631.181" dur="1.954">is there in that as much,</text><text start="4633.135" dur="2.343">because there&apos;s a sense of
lack of control to some degree,</text><text start="4635.478" dur="1.167">but who knows?</text><text start="4637.808" dur="3.866">- [Daniel] Well, I mean, I would say,</text><text start="4641.674" dur="2.449">so increased narcissistic trait,</text><text start="4644.123" dur="3.058">subclinical narcissistic
personality disorder,</text><text start="4647.181" dur="0.93">and I&apos;m not saying this</text><text start="4648.111" dur="1.293">because I&apos;ve done on the stats on it.</text><text start="4649.404" dur="2.797">I don&apos;t think anyone has done the stats</text><text start="4652.201" dur="1.171">that I would want to see,</text><text start="4653.372" dur="3.417">so I&apos;m speaking kind of intuitively here.</text><text start="4662.518" dur="2.423">First, I would say that many of these,</text><text start="4664.941" dur="3.174">like whatever the official
stat on how many women</text><text start="4668.115" dur="2.186">have gone through sexual
assault is, it&apos;s just too low.</text><text start="4670.301" dur="1.286">It&apos;s way too low, for a bunch of reasons,</text><text start="4671.587" dur="3.588">meaning almost everybody that I know</text><text start="4675.175" dur="2.687">has the shared consensus
that a much higher percentage</text><text start="4677.862" dur="1.31">of all the women they&apos;ve
ever met went through</text><text start="4679.172" dur="1.842">some form of sexual abuse
than the one in four</text><text start="4681.014" dur="1.593">that the statistic supposedly is.</text><text start="4682.607" dur="2.652">It&apos;s more like 90%, or 85%, or something.</text><text start="4685.259" dur="2.762">So I think there is some
kind of under-reporting,</text><text start="4688.021" dur="2.586">under-assessing types of
issues that are part of it.</text><text start="4690.607" dur="1.905">And so, when we look at what percentage</text><text start="4692.512" dur="2.618">of the population has
narcissistic personality disorder,</text><text start="4695.13" dur="2.236">whatever, that might be wrong, right?</text><text start="4697.366" dur="2.285">Those assessments might be
wrong for any number of reasons.</text><text start="4699.651" dur="3.76">There&apos;s reasons to hide
that signal if you can.</text><text start="4703.411" dur="2.355">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] But I would say</text><text start="4705.766" dur="4.041">that the percentage of
narcissistic personality disorder,</text><text start="4709.807" dur="2.223">or antisocial personality disorder</text><text start="4712.03" dur="3.02">in the general population
is probably much higher</text><text start="4715.05" dur="2.843">than it ever was in an indigenous tribe,</text><text start="4717.893" dur="1.525">in which case I would say it was probably</text><text start="4719.418" dur="2.369">much, much closer to zero,</text><text start="4721.787" dur="1.551">because it would have
always been found out,</text><text start="4723.338" dur="1.367">and be non-adaptive.</text><text start="4724.705" dur="1.409">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] And I would say</text><text start="4726.114" dur="2.939">it&apos;s gonna be much higher as
you climb up the stack of power</text><text start="4729.053" dur="1.591">and you have to actually
win at lots of power games</text><text start="4730.644" dur="1.096">to get up there.</text><text start="4731.74" dur="1.95">And so, you know, there are some stats,</text><text start="4733.69" dur="0.833">I don&apos;t know if they&apos;re any good,</text><text start="4734.523" dur="2.954">but it&apos;s like, you know, 5%
in the general population</text><text start="4737.477" dur="3.71">and 30% in the C-suite of Fortune 500s,</text><text start="4741.187" dur="1.825">and probably something like 90%</text><text start="4743.012" dur="3.278">in the C-suite of top financial
services companies, and-</text><text start="4746.29" dur="1.302">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] So-</text><text start="4747.592" dur="2.047">- [Zubin] It&apos;s adaptive
in those locations, yeah.</text><text start="4749.639" dur="2.5">- [Daniel] It is selected for,</text><text start="4753.059" dur="2.239">incentivized, conditioned.
- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="4755.298" dur="0.992">- [Daniel] Et cetera.
- [Zubin] All the above.</text><text start="4756.29" dur="0.952">- [Daniel] Which then also means</text><text start="4757.242" dur="2.139">that people with those conditions</text><text start="4759.381" dur="2.371">also have a disproportionate
amount of power</text><text start="4761.752" dur="2.663">and influence institutionally.</text><text start="4764.415" dur="2.143">- [Zubin] Which that feeds
back on a population level,</text><text start="4766.558" dur="1.702">because the institutions are a big part</text><text start="4768.26" dur="3.653">of our socio-technological environment.</text><text start="4771.913" dur="2.27">- [Daniel] So do I think that, you know,</text><text start="4774.183" dur="2.98">narcissistic traits are much higher</text><text start="4777.163" dur="2.728">than is native to the human condition</text><text start="4779.891" dur="1.602">under different
developmental environments,</text><text start="4781.493" dur="0.833">and particularly tribal?</text><text start="4782.326" dur="2.459">Like tribal environment,
you&apos;re just not gonna get away</text><text start="4784.785" dur="1.175">with lying very well-
- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="4785.96" dur="1.62">- [Daniel] &apos;Cause there&apos;s
too much surveillance.</text><text start="4787.58" dur="2.017">You&apos;re not gonna get
away with hurting people</text><text start="4789.597" dur="1.621">in a small environment,
where everybody knows</text><text start="4791.218" dur="1.097">what&apos;s happening with everybody.</text><text start="4792.315" dur="1.125">You&apos;re not gonna be able to hide</text><text start="4793.44" dur="0.956">the effects of things, right?</text><text start="4794.396" dur="2.527">The increased transparency.</text><text start="4796.923" dur="1.725">But as soon as the
system gets large enough</text><text start="4798.648" dur="2.236">that you can hide the effects,</text><text start="4800.884" dur="1.905">then you start having
an evolutionary niche</text><text start="4802.789" dur="2.411">for those kinds of parasitic
and predatory behaviors.</text><text start="4805.2" dur="4.125">- [Zubin] It gets right back
to the asshole agenesis.</text><text start="4809.325" dur="1.545">- [Daniel] Exactly.
- [Zubin] The same exact thing</text><text start="4810.87" dur="2.606">that now it becomes not just okay,</text><text start="4813.476" dur="2.131">but there is a niche where it flourishes,</text><text start="4815.607" dur="3.306">and it may not actually
be directly incentivized,</text><text start="4818.913" dur="2.022">but it certainly isn&apos;t disincentivized,</text><text start="4820.935" dur="2.475">and actually there are, like
you said, selection factors</text><text start="4823.41" dur="2.958">that actually enrich
it in that population.</text><text start="4826.368" dur="3.366">And then, so this is
interesting, because the idea</text><text start="4829.734" dur="1.813">that this exists now
at a higher level, say,</text><text start="4831.547" dur="2.726">than in tribal times means
that this is not something</text><text start="4834.273" dur="1.14">you reduce to genetics.</text><text start="4835.413" dur="1.771">It&apos;s not something you reduce to DNA.</text><text start="4837.184" dur="3.329">It&apos;s a complex biopsychosocial process</text><text start="4840.513" dur="2.426">that&apos;s an interplay between
us, our environment, our genes,</text><text start="4842.939" dur="3.049">our hardware, our software,
and everything else, yeah?</text><text start="4845.988" dur="2.637">- [Daniel] Let&apos;s say
we&apos;re looking at genes</text><text start="4848.625" dur="2.903">and some particular psychiatric condition,</text><text start="4851.528" dur="1.301">or neurological condition.</text><text start="4852.829" dur="3.904">It&apos;s like does everyone
with APOE4 get Alzheimer&apos;s?</text><text start="4856.733" dur="2.574">No, are there some people
who have Alzheimer&apos;s</text><text start="4859.307" dur="0.833">that don&apos;t have APOE4?</text><text start="4860.14" dur="4.357">Yes, so that&apos;s part of, that&apos;s
one type of causal dynamic.</text><text start="4864.497" dur="1.71">It is not a one-for-one causation.</text><text start="4866.207" dur="1.55">Typically, in biological situations,</text><text start="4867.757" dur="2.698">it&apos;s not simple as one cause, right?</text><text start="4870.455" dur="2.967">It&apos;s a lot of things that
collectively can reach a threshold</text><text start="4873.422" dur="2.113">and you have nexus causation.
- [Zubin] That&apos;s right.</text><text start="4875.535" dur="2.504">- [Daniel] So are there
genes that predispose</text><text start="4878.039" dur="1.043">certain kinds of things,</text><text start="4879.082" dur="2.51">but there&apos;s a lot of other
attenuating factors and whatever?</text><text start="4881.592" dur="1.917">Totally.
- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="4884.661" dur="1.763">- [Daniel] That&apos;s what
I think with regard,</text><text start="4886.424" dur="1.0">I think that</text><text start="4890.204" dur="1.722">the anxiety, the
depression, the narcissism,</text><text start="4891.926" dur="1.848">the short attention spans,</text><text start="4893.774" dur="1.692">I think those are all conditionable,</text><text start="4895.466" dur="4.247">and I think they&apos;re
conditionable where, you know,</text><text start="4899.713" dur="3.059">I like to look at positive
deviance culturally,</text><text start="4902.772" dur="2.991">like where a whole culture
for some period of time had</text><text start="4905.763" dur="1.578">one, or two standard deviations more</text><text start="4907.341" dur="0.981">of some desirable trait.</text><text start="4908.322" dur="4.278">So I like to look at
Jains for nonviolence,</text><text start="4912.6" dur="2.29">or Buddhists, or Quakers,
and be able to see</text><text start="4914.89" dur="0.953">can you have a whole population,</text><text start="4915.843" dur="2.56">which means all the genetic
mutation within that population,</text><text start="4918.403" dur="1.004">and all the kind of variance,</text><text start="4919.407" dur="3.31">but where the population as a

than everybody else&apos;s?</text><text start="4924.489" dur="1.432">- [Zubin] So there&apos;s a group dynamic-</text><text start="4925.921" dur="2.207">- [Daniel] Which means
that culture, right,</text><text start="4928.128" dur="2.467">actually was able to, with
factoring genetics, whatever,</text><text start="4930.595" dur="0.84">attenuate that a lot,</text><text start="4931.435" dur="4.287">and the same as across very
different environments,</text><text start="4935.722" dur="2.055">do Jews usually educate their kids better</text><text start="4937.777" dur="2.047">than a lot of other cultures do,</text><text start="4939.824" dur="1.103">and reach higher level of education?</text><text start="4940.927" dur="1.929">It&apos;s very clear there&apos;s a cultural effect</text><text start="4942.856" dur="1.463">that does that thing, right?</text><text start="4944.319" dur="3.083">And so, then you start to think about</text><text start="4949.228" dur="2.829">could you have something
that had Buddhist nonviolence</text><text start="4952.057" dur="2.552">and Jewish education and
whatever types of processes</text><text start="4954.609" dur="1.742">in terms of could you have a culture</text><text start="4956.351" dur="2.0">that was developing the,</text><text start="4961.799" dur="1.603">you know, a different
set of traits in people</text><text start="4963.402" dur="2.433">that made a different set of
civilization possibilities</text><text start="4965.835" dur="4.235">associated with a increased
post-cynical possibility?</text><text start="4970.07" dur="1.348">Now, of course, we&apos;re
also looking at the fact</text><text start="4971.418" dur="2.433">that the technology is
developing people itself.</text><text start="4973.851" dur="2.998">As we were saying, just simply the,</text><text start="4976.849" dur="3.061">simply the infinite scroll

- [Zubin] We see that now-</text><text start="4994.459" dur="1.76">- [Daniel] It means democracy will end,</text><text start="4996.219" dur="3.104">because democracy requires a
long enough attention span,</text><text start="4999.323" dur="1.802">a long enough working

of their goals, right?</text><text start="5008.183" dur="1.217">Like if I really wanna be able to do</text><text start="5009.4" dur="1.752">collective intelligence
well, it requires that,</text><text start="5011.152" dur="2.73">which is why, you know,
Marshall McLuhan showed</text><text start="5013.882" dur="2.58">that not only did the
printing press occur as,</text><text start="5016.462" dur="2.614">and the written word being
accessible to everybody,</text><text start="5019.076" dur="1.17">everybody could get a newspaper,</text><text start="5020.246" dur="2.446">so you didn&apos;t need a
specialized knowledge class</text><text start="5022.692" dur="2.961">that had access, and everyone
could get textbooks and read,</text><text start="5025.653" dur="1.685">not only was the printing
press a prerequisite</text><text start="5027.338" dur="1.92">for democracy, but the written word</text><text start="5029.258" dur="4.291">as the primary type of
media was probably required</text><text start="5033.549" dur="1.051">for democracy to work,</text><text start="5034.6" dur="2.027">because it required people
to think well enough</text><text start="5036.627" dur="2.752">that they could communicate
in writing in long form</text><text start="5039.379" dur="2.544">in a way that could then
translate to legal code, right,</text><text start="5041.923" dur="2.045">to really think through things formally,</text><text start="5043.968" dur="1.055">and that they were reading,</text><text start="5045.023" dur="2.472">which meant increased attention span</text><text start="5047.495" dur="2.045">of non-dopaminergic stuff,</text><text start="5049.54" dur="1.912">which also meant enough

be able to find something</text><text start="5053.565" dur="1.539">that might work, come up
with a good proposition.</text><text start="5055.104" dur="2.147">- [Zubin] It&apos;s like the Hamilton
era where you, you know,</text><text start="5057.251" dur="1.393">they would write these big treatises,</text><text start="5058.644" dur="2.14">and they would argue in
like 20 pages of text,</text><text start="5060.784" dur="1.452">and it was beautiful prose,</text><text start="5062.236" dur="1.852">and extremely, compellingly well-written,</text><text start="5064.088" dur="3.363">and persuasion and knowledge

statement on social media</text><text start="5073.417" dur="2.954">with like, dislike, anger that is designed</text><text start="5076.371" dur="2.337">to inflame rather than

otherwise, what you end up getting</text><text start="5103.414" dur="2.307">is voting on a binary, right?</text><text start="5105.721" dur="3.254">One candidate, or another, or
yes, or no on a proposition,</text><text start="5108.975" dur="2.677">inherently polarizing the population,</text><text start="5111.652" dur="2.984">because what the proposition has created</text><text start="5114.636" dur="1.982">that benefits one thing, but

kept it from being able</text><text start="5336.478" dur="3.869">to do that, kind of
basic market theory idea.</text><text start="5340.347" dur="2.626">Well, typically, the only
way to get a monopoly was</text><text start="5342.973" dur="2.723">to do some activity, where
you were forcibly crushing</text><text start="5345.696" dur="2.74">the competition through
some kind of, you know,</text><text start="5348.436" dur="1.768">fucked up practices, or
you got the government</text><text start="5350.204" dur="1.938">to grant you unique access
rights, or whatever.</text><text start="5352.142" dur="2.02">So there&apos;s a bunch of
antitrust law stuff to prevent</text><text start="5354.162" dur="1.691">that stuff from happening.</text><text start="5355.853" dur="1.532">But with network dynamics</text><text start="5357.385" dur="2.699">that specifically the
internet made possible,</text><text start="5360.084" dur="2.111">a natural type of monopoly emerged</text><text start="5362.195" dur="1.555">that was totally different in its process.</text><text start="5363.75" dur="1.714">It didn&apos;t require those
same fucked up processes,</text><text start="5365.464" dur="1.765">and yet you still get
the function of something</text><text start="5367.229" dur="2.23">that doesn&apos;t have competition
checking it, right?</text><text start="5369.459" dur="1.422">So Metcalfe&apos;s law basically says</text><text start="5370.881" dur="5.0">for something where the value
of the thing is proportional,</text><text start="5376.003" dur="2.604">the value of the thing involves
user-generated activity,</text><text start="5378.607" dur="1.126">and the more users that are involved,</text><text start="5379.733" dur="0.943">the more valuable it is.</text><text start="5380.676" dur="1.648">It&apos;s not just linearly more valuable.</text><text start="5382.324" dur="2.065">It&apos;s second power more valuable.</text><text start="5384.389" dur="3.243">And so, a currency that
only a few people use</text><text start="5387.632" dur="1.447">is not that valuable, &apos;cause
I don&apos;t want a currency</text><text start="5389.079" dur="1.966">where I have to have 50
different currencies in my wallet</text><text start="5391.045" dur="1.866">for the different stores that
all take different currencies.</text><text start="5392.911" dur="1.752">One currency that&apos;s usable everywhere,</text><text start="5394.663" dur="4.236">like a monopoly on money,
which kind of the Fed is, was,</text><text start="5398.899" dur="2.197">there was a very high use value in that.</text><text start="5401.096" dur="0.975">Similarly, on Facebook,</text><text start="5402.071" dur="1.327">every fuckin&apos; person I know is there.</text><text start="5403.398" dur="1.655">I don&apos;t want 30 different social networks,</text><text start="5405.053" dur="1.288">where I have to have 30 different logins</text><text start="5406.341" dur="1.971">for different groups of people,</text><text start="5408.312" dur="2.358">and I can buy everything I want on Amazon,</text><text start="5410.67" dur="1.836">and I can find everything
I want on Google, right?</text><text start="5412.506" dur="2.928">So when you have a network type dynamic</text><text start="5415.434" dur="2.88">where the more stuff you
have, the more value you have,</text><text start="5418.314" dur="2.42">and as a second power, once you get up</text><text start="5420.734" dur="2.101">to a certain percentage of
the population involved,</text><text start="5422.835" dur="1.957">you reach an escape velocity,</text><text start="5424.792" dur="1.846">where you will become a monopoly,</text><text start="5426.638" dur="2.284">and you&apos;ll have one search engine</text><text start="5428.922" dur="1.548">that has radically more dominance</text><text start="5430.47" dur="1.926">than all the other search
engines, one online store,</text><text start="5432.396" dur="1.675">one social network that has radically more</text><text start="5434.071" dur="1.966">within its vertical.</text><text start="5436.037" dur="1.937">And you might get something
that can get a lot of dominance,</text><text start="5437.974" dur="1.201">but in a slightly different vertical,</text><text start="5439.175" dur="1.31">like Twitter relative to Facebook,</text><text start="5440.485" dur="1.237">but it&apos;s a different media type.</text><text start="5441.722" dur="1.107">- [Zubin] Right.</text><text start="5442.829" dur="3.078">- [Daniel] And so, that
creates natural monopolies</text><text start="5445.907" dur="2.469">we don&apos;t currently have a way to check,</text><text start="5448.376" dur="2.514">and at huge scale
intrinsic to the process.</text><text start="5450.89" dur="3.129">It&apos;s at a huge scale of
social influence, right?</text><text start="5454.019" dur="2.294">Facebook and Google both
have like 3 billion people,</text><text start="5456.313" dur="2.954">which is the population
of China, and Russia,</text><text start="5459.267" dur="1.478">and the US, and Iran combined.</text><text start="5460.745" dur="2.549">- [Zubin] They&apos;re bigger

that&apos;s fuckin&apos; huge deal.&quot;</text><text start="5468.369" dur="1.574">There were no corporations that had</text><text start="5469.943" dur="1.732">that kind of thing before.</text><text start="5471.675" dur="3.667">And if it is customizing

is a lawless place, whatever,</text><text start="5893.671" dur="1.588">the other signaling something different.</text><text start="5895.259" dur="0.998">That&apos;s just the beginning</text><text start="5896.257" dur="1.353">to the field of environmental psych,</text><text start="5897.61" dur="1.377">and the way that environments affect us,</text><text start="5898.987" dur="2.551">and you walk into a cathedral,</text><text start="5901.538" dur="1.5">and the technology</text><text start="5905.625" dur="1.585">of the cathedral has an effect.</text><text start="5907.21" dur="3.063">Like you look up, and when
you look up, you feel small,</text><text start="5910.273" dur="2.457">and you have some sense of
vastness that starts to come.</text><text start="5912.73" dur="2.0">And you know, even just,</text><text start="5915.568" dur="1.433">you know, I was mentioning</text><text start="5917.001" dur="3.097">that the volatile organic
compounds built into the paint</text><text start="5920.098" dur="4.691">and the carpet are subclinical
toxins that, you know,</text><text start="5924.789" dur="3.538">like the formaldehydes,
the organophosphates.</text><text start="5928.327" dur="2.388">We did not even evolve
to process these things.</text><text start="5930.715" dur="1.488">- [Zubin] Right, they didn&apos;t exist.</text><text start="5932.203" dur="1.07">- [Daniel] They were not
part of what our liver</text><text start="5933.273" dur="2.387">and kidneys were supposed to deal with.</text><text start="5935.66" dur="3.086">So that&apos;s a way that we built
for a very specific purpose,</text><text start="5938.746" dur="1.771">or we started putting fungicides in paints</text><text start="5940.517" dur="1.697">to prevent internal mold that then started</text><text start="5942.214" dur="3.794">to also make mutated species
of molds, and whatever.</text><text start="5946.008" dur="2.291">We were designing the paint for
some very specific purposes,</text><text start="5948.299" dur="1.289">but it produced second
and third-order effects</text><text start="5949.588" dur="1.212">we weren&apos;t paying attention to.</text><text start="5950.8" dur="2.284">But even low ceilings,</text><text start="5953.084" dur="2.553">whereas, you know, tribal people
that mostly lived outside,</text><text start="5955.637" dur="1.204">you looked up a whole lot more,</text><text start="5956.841" dur="1.956">there&apos;s neurology to looking up, right?</text><text start="5958.797" dur="3.067">It actually stimulates different
types of cognitive process-</text><text start="5961.864" dur="1.31">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] To have your head</text><text start="5963.174" dur="0.848">and your eyes go up.</text><text start="5964.022" dur="1.623">So the cathedral knows that,</text><text start="5965.645" dur="1.179">puts things up there on purpose</text><text start="5966.824" dur="1.832">that stimulates a certain kind of process.</text><text start="5968.656" dur="1.81">So that&apos;s like
environmental design, right,</text><text start="5970.466" dur="2.38">environmental psych applied
to environmental design.</text><text start="5972.846" dur="1.607">The term ontological design is</text><text start="5974.453" dur="1.909">wherein we&apos;re designing environments</text><text start="5976.362" dur="3.411">that are in turn affecting
our own future ontologies,</text><text start="5979.773" dur="1.603">our own future experience of the world,</text><text start="5981.376" dur="2.64">beliefs, ways of being, et cetera.</text><text start="5984.016" dur="1.99">And so, I think most people know</text><text start="5986.006" dur="1.551">that if you have experienced,</text><text start="5987.557" dur="2.138">if you&apos;re in an old growth forest,</text><text start="5989.695" dur="2.917">or if you&apos;re in a beautiful temple,</text><text start="5994.161" dur="1.055">or if you&apos;re in a ghetto,</text><text start="5995.216" dur="2.081">you feel different

can be so extremely different,</text><text start="6005.44" dur="2.106">have such extreme personalization,</text><text start="6007.546" dur="3.066">and reward dynamics, and
all those types of things.</text><text start="6010.612" dur="1.942">And people are spending more of their time</text><text start="6012.554" dur="3.706">in digital environments that
we&apos;re obviously not adapted to,</text><text start="6016.26" dur="3.486">and that are designed for are
mostly extractive purposes</text><text start="6019.746" dur="2.599">regarding you, rather than developing you</text><text start="6022.345" dur="1.732">in positive kind of ways.</text><text start="6024.077" dur="3.083">So if you think about the like, okay,</text><text start="6028.402" dur="2.819">okay, the first part is
to say tech is affecting</text><text start="6031.221" dur="2.521">our value systems and our experience</text><text start="6033.742" dur="2.232">of what it means to be people
individually and collectively.</text><text start="6035.974" dur="1.554">Tech is not values agnostic.</text><text start="6037.528" dur="1.961">That&apos;s the first kind of construction,</text><text start="6039.489" dur="1.474">and I&apos;ll come back to this other part.</text><text start="6040.963" dur="1.152">Tech is not values agnostic.</text><text start="6042.115" dur="3.936">If you read Marvin Harris,
&quot;Cultural Materialism,&quot;</text><text start="6046.051" dur="1.835">it&apos;s a, you know, a very empirical school</text><text start="6047.886" dur="2.256">of cultural anthropology
that basically says</text><text start="6050.142" dur="1.63">the changes in our social systems,</text><text start="6051.772" dur="1.864">and even the changes in
our religion, and culture,</text><text start="6053.636" dur="1.762">were usually proceeded by changes in tech</text><text start="6055.398" dur="1.652">that coded for certain
patterns of behavior</text><text start="6057.05" dur="1.451">that coded for certain value systems</text><text start="6058.501" dur="1.73">that were associated, so-</text><text start="6060.231" dur="2.078">- [Zubin] The plow, for example, yeah-</text><text start="6062.309" dur="1.268">- [Daniel] You wanna give that one?</text><text start="6063.577" dur="1.962">- [Zubin] So you know, people used to,</text><text start="6065.539" dur="2.878">this is a fascinating one,
and God, this, you know,</text><text start="6068.417" dur="2.38">this is central to our
experience as humans,</text><text start="6070.797" dur="1.708">and experience in healthcare,</text><text start="6072.505" dur="1.301">like taking care of sick people.</text><text start="6073.806" dur="1.538">We don&apos;t, we pull them out.</text><text start="6075.344" dur="3.109">We left-brain yank them
out of their context</text><text start="6078.453" dur="1.818">into a room that&apos;s cold and sterile,</text><text start="6080.271" dur="2.272">and we say, &quot;Here&apos;s what wrong with you</text><text start="6082.543" dur="2.183">&quot;based on these extracted tests,&quot;</text><text start="6084.726" dur="3.664">whereas where we&apos;ve totally
decontextualized these humans.</text><text start="6088.39" dur="2.363">Anyway, so back to this plow.</text><text start="6090.753" dur="0.833">Pre-plow,</text><text start="6094.56" dur="2.221">societies tended to be very interesting.</text><text start="6096.781" dur="1.795">They had maternal female gods.</text><text start="6098.576" dur="1.241">They had this kind of idea</text><text start="6099.817" dur="4.478">that women would actually do a
lot of the farming and stuff,</text><text start="6104.295" dur="2.195">because they could, and
the guys would go out,</text><text start="6106.49" dur="1.49">and do hunter gathering,
and things like that,</text><text start="6107.98" dur="2.456">and it played to their
strengths at the time.</text><text start="6110.436" dur="1.793">Then the plow gets invented,</text><text start="6112.229" dur="1.74">and this, here&apos;s the technological thing.</text><text start="6113.969" dur="1.223">Now, several things happen.</text><text start="6115.192" dur="3.164">First of all, you can use
an animal to pull the plow,</text><text start="6118.356" dur="2.66">which now changes the theology</text><text start="6121.016" dur="2.886">and the animism around
our worship of animals,</text><text start="6123.902" dur="1.333">&apos;cause now if you make an animal,</text><text start="6125.235" dur="2.638">if you elevate an animal to
some sort of godlike creature,</text><text start="6127.873" dur="2.293">and you&apos;re forcing it
to do this manual labor,</text><text start="6130.166" dur="1.171">well, that doesn&apos;t really vibe.</text><text start="6131.337" dur="3.083">So now, mm-mm, the entire culture
shifts to where it&apos;s like,</text><text start="6134.42" dur="3.013">&quot;No, God gave man the
dominion over animals,</text><text start="6137.433" dur="1.37">&quot;and so now, use it as you will.&quot;</text><text start="6138.803" dur="3.306">It&apos;s less than a sacred thing in itself.</text><text start="6142.109" dur="3.812">And women now in order to
man sort of things like plows</text><text start="6145.921" dur="2.67">and things like that, it becomes
very physically demanding.</text><text start="6148.591" dur="1.332">They would have miscarriages, et cetera.</text><text start="6149.923" dur="1.954">So now it became disadvantageous</text><text start="6151.877" dur="1.035">for women to do the farming,</text><text start="6152.912" dur="2.666">so they ended up then
taking different roles,</text><text start="6155.578" dur="1.956">which then changed the,</text><text start="6157.534" dur="2.612">because the production of food
is associated with deities,</text><text start="6160.146" dur="3.486">et cetera, now you have
male-dominated type gods.</text><text start="6163.632" dur="3.205">And so, the entire course
of civilization changes</text><text start="6166.837" dur="2.875">from an invention, and
these are spiritual changes,</text><text start="6169.712" dur="2.586">these are emotional changes,
these are social changes,</text><text start="6172.298" dur="1.2">and they&apos;re technological changes,</text><text start="6173.498" dur="1.88">and they all interact in this web.</text><text start="6175.378" dur="0.833">It&apos;s fascinating.</text><text start="6176.211" dur="2.531">- [Daniel] Obviously, the
plow gave surplus in a way</text><text start="6178.742" dur="2.125">that we didn&apos;t have before,
which was really key,</text><text start="6180.867" dur="1.387">because now you can have grains,</text><text start="6182.254" dur="2.42">and in a gathering environment,
grains are not that useful.</text><text start="6184.674" dur="2.203">You gotta have a lot of
grain to be really useful.</text><text start="6186.877" dur="1.802">So the combo of the plow
and the basket means</text><text start="6188.679" dur="1.964">now we can have really
meaningful caloric surplus,</text><text start="6190.643" dur="2.97">so we can also grow our
population much faster,</text><text start="6193.613" dur="1.469">and we can make it through famines,</text><text start="6195.082" dur="3.408">and we can start to have
concentrated wealth.</text><text start="6198.49" dur="2.241">As a result of that, ownership
starts to mean something,</text><text start="6200.731" dur="1.38">and property rights
start to mean something,</text><text start="6202.111" dur="1.388">and then class systems start to emerge,</text><text start="6203.499" dur="2.071">and then civilization
structures to be able to deal</text><text start="6205.57" dur="1.03">with class systems start to emerge,</text><text start="6206.6" dur="2.671">and then if you own
stuff, then inheritance,</text><text start="6209.271" dur="2.284">and so, then the formalizing of marriage,</text><text start="6211.555" dur="2.037">and the changing of those
contracts to be able</text><text start="6213.592" dur="2.999">to have paternity certainty
associated with the inheritance</text><text start="6216.591" dur="2.073">of the stuff, like all of those things</text><text start="6218.664" dur="2.134">follow that kind of tech, right?</text><text start="6220.798" dur="1.916">- [Zubin] And that&apos;s a plow!</text><text start="6222.714" dur="1.505">- [Daniel] Yeah-
- [Zubin] That&apos;s a plow.</text><text start="6224.219" dur="2.458">- [Daniel] So then, I would say,</text><text start="6226.677" dur="1.499">and of course, the history
of this is actually</text><text start="6228.176" dur="1.069">a million times more nuanced.</text><text start="6229.245" dur="2.454">I just want people to get the
gist of the kind of thing.</text><text start="6231.699" dur="3.037">But the animism is just
such a great example.</text><text start="6234.736" dur="2.75">I can bow and arrow kill a bison,</text><text start="6238.463" dur="2.342">and still pray to the spirit of the bison,</text><text start="6240.805" dur="3.428">and say, &quot;When I die, I wanna
become soil that becomes grass</text><text start="6244.233" dur="1.642">&quot;for the grandchild of this bison,</text><text start="6245.875" dur="2.362">&quot;and be a part of the great
web of life,&quot; and everything.</text><text start="6248.237" dur="2.459">But I can&apos;t take the bison,</text><text start="6250.696" dur="2.57">and hybridize it into an ox,</text><text start="6253.266" dur="1.951">yoke it, cut its balls off,</text><text start="6255.217" dur="1.741">and beat it all day long to pull the plow,</text><text start="6256.958" dur="2.751">and still believe in the
spirit of the buffalo, right?</text><text start="6259.709" dur="2.5">And so, to use a plow require,</text><text start="6263.622" dur="2.24">like the plow codes a pattern of behavior,</text><text start="6265.862" dur="2.154">which is beating an ox all day long,</text><text start="6268.016" dur="4.356">and that requires a
change of value system.</text><text start="6272.372" dur="2.282">And yet, the tribe that doesn&apos;t do that</text><text start="6274.654" dur="1.442">is just going to lose, because they have</text><text start="6276.096" dur="1.301">so much less caloric surplus</text><text start="6277.397" dur="1.999">and whatever than the
tribe that does that.</text><text start="6279.396" dur="1.657">So this is an example
of how the tools change</text><text start="6281.053" dur="1.477">the value systems.</text><text start="6282.53" dur="0.982">There are other examples</text><text start="6283.512" dur="2.084">where you can make value system changes</text><text start="6285.596" dur="2.228">independent of tools
that will in turn change</text><text start="6287.824" dur="0.92">how we use the tools,</text><text start="6288.744" dur="2.801">like the Sabbath was kind
of a social technology</text><text start="6291.545" dur="3.489">for how do we not use the
tools for some period of time,</text><text start="6295.034" dur="2.624">not to be hijacked by productivity,</text><text start="6297.658" dur="2.5">orient towards the value
system in each other,</text><text start="6300.158" dur="1.953">to make sure that we&apos;re in
turn directing those things.</text><text start="6302.111" dur="1.211">- [Zubin] Ah.</text><text start="6303.322" dur="1.364">- [Daniel] That&apos;s one
way of thinking about it.</text><text start="6304.686" dur="2.528">So we have to actually get this direction</text><text start="6307.214" dur="3.501">of developing culture to bind the tech</text><text start="6310.715" dur="2.219">and inform the social structures.</text><text start="6312.934" dur="2.149">But you can also build tech</text><text start="6315.083" dur="2.78">that in knowing that the
tech is going to influence</text><text start="6317.863" dur="3.414">the psychology, the values, and
the behaviors of the people,</text><text start="6321.277" dur="4.204">that should be intentionally
factored in the design process.</text><text start="6325.481" dur="2.636">So then both the design of Facebook,</text><text start="6328.117" dur="1.844">the design of the monetary system,</text><text start="6329.961" dur="1.926">the design of the Anthropocene,</text><text start="6331.887" dur="1.328">the design of the
paints, and the building,</text><text start="6333.215" dur="2.442">and all those things, you&apos;d say</text><text start="6335.657" dur="1.821">if in addition to whatever it does, right,</text><text start="6337.478" dur="1.171">it&apos;s supposed to answer phone calls,</text><text start="6338.649" dur="1.914">it&apos;s supposed to be able to
give me access to information,</text><text start="6340.563" dur="1.508">it&apos;s supposed to be able to keep rain off,</text><text start="6342.071" dur="2.064">in addition to that, it&apos;s also affecting</text><text start="6344.135" dur="1.5">the psychological,</text><text start="6347.988" dur="1.844">physiological, relational health</text><text start="6349.832" dur="1.394">and dispositions of the people.</text><text start="6351.226" dur="2.972">So we say the number one design constraint</text><text start="6354.198" dur="2.659">of all the tech has to be that</text><text start="6356.857" dur="3.798">the ontologic design effect
it has is enlightening</text><text start="6360.655" dur="2.205">to the people that it&apos;s
interacting with, right?</text><text start="6362.86" dur="3.798">So how do you, then the
ontologic design question,</text><text start="6366.658" dur="2.213">how do you rebuild
civilization from scratch?</text><text start="6368.871" dur="1.345">How do we rebuild the technosphere</text><text start="6370.216" dur="2.126">and Anthropocene from scratch
to maximally enlighten</text><text start="6372.342" dur="1.502">the people that are within it, right?</text><text start="6373.844" dur="4.042">So both increasing their own
health, happiness, well-being,</text><text start="6377.886" dur="1.795">and their sense-making, meaning-making,</text><text start="6379.681" dur="3.465">choice-making capacities
for collective well-being.</text><text start="6383.146" dur="2.701">I think that when you start to realize</text><text start="6385.847" dur="3.209">it doesn&apos;t take everybody having</text><text start="6389.056" dur="1.492">a deeper understanding of these things</text><text start="6390.548" dur="1.933">for them to start
designing tech differently</text><text start="6392.481" dur="1.335">that will start to affect everyone.</text><text start="6393.816" dur="2.25">Obviously, it took not that
many people to build Facebook</text><text start="6396.066" dur="1.67">that then started to
affect 3 billion people,</text><text start="6397.736" dur="1.715">and as a result, also everybody, right,</text><text start="6399.451" dur="1.797">because in that effect it
was on broadcast media,</text><text start="6401.248" dur="2.043">and culture, and what the US government,</text><text start="6403.291" dur="1.426">and military, and economy is doing,</text><text start="6404.717" dur="3.778">and it wouldn&apos;t take that
many people to build something</text><text start="6408.495" dur="2.243">that was more protopic in the nature</text><text start="6410.738" dur="3.548">of what the tech influenced
people to do behaviorally.</text><text start="6414.286" dur="4.908">And so, yeah, that is one
of the sources of optimism.</text><text start="6419.194" dur="2.762">- [Zubin] Yeah, and I&apos;m actually,</text><text start="6421.956" dur="3.232">it&apos;s tricky, because
threading the needle requires</text><text start="6425.188" dur="2.925">the optimism that it can be done.</text><text start="6428.113" dur="2.039">And I think it can be done,
but as you&apos;ve said before,</text><text start="6430.152" dur="1.92">I think the narrowing of the window</text><text start="6432.072" dur="2.342">through which we thread
this needle to avoid</text><text start="6434.414" dur="4.216">existential catastrophic

you look at the cosmos,</text><text start="6439.985" dur="1.674">and go, &quot;Why are aliens not here?&quot;</text><text start="6441.659" dur="1.352">Of course, this is very simplification.</text><text start="6443.011" dur="1.178">Is there a great filter out there,</text><text start="6444.189" dur="2.626">where civilizations all

leader guy, has said</text><text start="6461.172" dur="1.887">the entire universe could

nature of the universe,</text><text start="6465.797" dur="2.299">the true reality, wouldn&apos;t even notice.</text><text start="6468.096" dur="2.24">And so, this hubris that

is not quite right.</text><text start="6473.441" dur="3.454">So part of it is a more thoughtful design.</text><text start="6476.895" dur="2.113">Part of it is group sense-making, I think,</text><text start="6479.008" dur="2.247">of like how are we going to,</text><text start="6481.255" dur="0.932">what do we value?</text><text start="6482.187" dur="1.545">What matters to us?</text><text start="6483.732" dur="0.966">You mentioned the Sabbath,</text><text start="6484.698" dur="1.777">which I think is very interesting.</text><text start="6486.475" dur="1.747">My family and I, and I
have done videos on this,</text><text start="6488.222" dur="2.291">do a thing called screen-free Sunday,</text><text start="6490.513" dur="1.428">where we turn off all the devices,</text><text start="6491.941" dur="2.374">and we open up to each other again,</text><text start="6494.315" dur="1.667">and we&apos;re very present, and so on,</text><text start="6495.982" dur="1.816">and even my kids don&apos;t have
social media, or any of that,</text><text start="6497.798" dur="2.997">but they do use devices for other things.</text><text start="6500.795" dur="2.256">And it&apos;s been transformative for us,</text><text start="6503.051" dur="1.591">even that one day-

meditation retreat recently,</text><text start="6507.248" dur="1.9">six days, where I was
completely unplugged,</text><text start="6509.148" dur="1.339">and I&apos;ll tell you, if we think</text><text start="6510.487" dur="2.209">we&apos;ve permanently damaged

- [Zubin] Because I&apos;ve never,</text><text start="6514.306" dur="3.827">I mean, I was wide open,
connected, feeling love for people,</text><text start="6518.133" dur="1.348">and when I came back
and did a couple shows,</text><text start="6519.481" dur="2.579">it was actually against
my will to some degree.</text><text start="6522.06" dur="1.692">But when I did it, you
could see those shows.</text><text start="6523.752" dur="1.878">Like it&apos;s a different me.</text><text start="6525.63" dur="2.873">I&apos;m like, &quot;Guys, let&apos;s really</text><text start="6528.503" dur="1.649">&quot;just try to connect this together.&quot;</text><text start="6530.152" dur="1.752">And I think that&apos;s doable.</text><text start="6531.904" dur="3.289">I think it is, but it
takes some collective will.</text><text start="6535.193" dur="2.937">- [Daniel] I have a colleague Zak Stein,</text><text start="6538.13" dur="3.75">who helped build a system
called Lectica that</text><text start="6543.929" dur="1.367">is one way of assessing</text><text start="6545.296" dur="2.949">a certain kind of human development,</text><text start="6548.245" dur="3.433">the complexity of
someone&apos;s thinking process.</text><text start="6551.678" dur="4.208">And they&apos;re able to kind of
look at someone&apos;s writing</text><text start="6555.886" dur="3.321">of certain types, and be
able to assess the complexity</text><text start="6559.207" dur="2.611">and nuance in their thinking,</text><text start="6561.818" dur="1.417">and made progress</text><text start="6565.225" dur="1.009">in being able to do that</text><text start="6566.234" dur="3.589">with machine learning and
natural language processing.</text><text start="6569.823" dur="2.417">So, and what that would mean,</text><text start="6573.148" dur="2.096">the complexity and nuance
of thinking, is the ability</text><text start="6575.244" dur="2.309">to take lots of different perspectives,</text><text start="6577.553" dur="2.346">the ability to notice
bias and error in those,</text><text start="6579.899" dur="2.748">the ability to notice ways of synthesizing</text><text start="6582.647" dur="2.403">and finding higher order reconciliation.</text><text start="6585.05" dur="1.963">So let&apos;s say, for instance,</text><text start="6587.013" dur="2.244">and this is really just,
I&apos;m throwing this out</text><text start="6589.257" dur="1.583">as a suggestive way</text><text start="6592.811" dur="1.827">of where something could go,</text><text start="6594.638" dur="2.6">not that this is the exact proposition.</text><text start="6597.238" dur="2.576">So let&apos;s say we built
a Facebook-like thing</text><text start="6599.814" dur="2.491">that had lots of
different types of content</text><text start="6602.305" dur="2.345">that were being personalized
to the individual,</text><text start="6604.65" dur="1.398">but that didn&apos;t have a business model</text><text start="6606.048" dur="2.094">that required ads to do it,</text><text start="6608.142" dur="2.364">so it had a different
basis of optimization,</text><text start="6610.506" dur="1.471">wasn&apos;t trying to maximize time on site,</text><text start="6611.977" dur="2.08">or engagement in that way.</text><text start="6614.057" dur="2.687">Let&apos;s say that the thing it
was trying to maximize was</text><text start="6616.744" dur="2.815">your Lectical Score.
- [Zubin] Hmm.</text><text start="6619.559" dur="1.068">- [Daniel] And so, it was looking</text><text start="6620.627" dur="2.838">at where you were typing in responses,</text><text start="6623.465" dur="1.394">and your general engagement,</text><text start="6624.859" dur="3.405">and it was wanting to
see that your ability to,</text><text start="6628.264" dur="1.989">and your disposition to seek</text><text start="6630.253" dur="1.378">and steel man more perspectives,</text><text start="6631.631" dur="1.748">and have more nuanced perspectives,</text><text start="6633.379" dur="1.833">more ability to orient</text><text start="6637.973" dur="2.788">towards empiricism where
it was relevant, et cetera,</text><text start="6640.761" dur="1.838">that those were the things
it was optimizing for,</text><text start="6642.599" dur="1.644">and it was curating content to you</text><text start="6644.243" dur="2.568">both based on what would be outside</text><text start="6646.811" dur="1.288">of what you were already exposed to,</text><text start="6648.099" dur="2.297">but also in the zone
of proximal development</text><text start="6650.396" dur="2.229">that you could grasp it.</text><text start="6652.625" dur="2.768">And again, empirically
upregulating in that way,</text><text start="6655.393" dur="2.866">that would produce really
different results, right?</text><text start="6658.259" dur="1.594">You could be growing attention span,</text><text start="6659.853" dur="1.168">rather than decreasing it.</text><text start="6661.021" dur="2.793">You could be growing multi-perspective,</text><text start="6663.814" dur="2.738">multi-perspectival kind of capacity</text><text start="6666.552" dur="2.576">through the nature of what that AI pointed</text><text start="6669.128" dur="2.371">at your brain is optimizing for.</text><text start="6671.499" dur="2.79">- [Zubin] Okay, I think
that&apos;s a doable thing.</text><text start="6674.289" dur="1.549">It would depend on the,
again, like you said,</text><text start="6675.838" dur="2.533">what are you optimizing for
in terms of also incentives?</text><text start="6678.371" dur="2.125">Like Facebook went viral,
because it&apos;s hacking</text><text start="6680.496" dur="2.154">into the capitalist incentive
of this is how you make money</text><text start="6682.65" dur="2.725">through ads, and so on, and it just became</text><text start="6685.375" dur="1.826">self-replicating that way.</text><text start="6687.201" dur="4.09">But like sometimes, YouTube&apos;s
algorithm will do that.</text><text start="6691.291" dur="1.586">It&apos;s quite remarkable.</text><text start="6692.877" dur="2.259">It will actually point, and I get this,</text><text start="6695.136" dur="3.379">and this is why, because people who,</text><text start="6698.515" dur="3.775">I do some meditation,
awakening type content,</text><text start="6702.29" dur="3.278">consciousness content, and
YouTube&apos;s algorithm seems</text><text start="6705.568" dur="1.452">to feed that content to people</text><text start="6707.02" dur="1.707">who have a vague interest in it,</text><text start="6708.727" dur="2.228">but also may overlap
slightly with healthcare.</text><text start="6710.955" dur="3.295">It kind of knows this in some way,</text><text start="6714.25" dur="1.39">and people will message me, and go,</text><text start="6715.64" dur="2.368">&quot;I don&apos;t know what, I don&apos;t
know, I never knew who you were,</text><text start="6718.008" dur="2.299">&quot;but I&apos;m a nurse, and I&apos;ve been having</text><text start="6720.307" dur="2.893">&quot;this existential crisis,
and I found your piece on,&quot;</text><text start="6723.2" dur="1.849">whatever, &quot;Donald Hoffman,
and then it went me,</text><text start="6725.049" dur="2.042">&quot;then YouTube fed me a
rabbit hole of your stuff,</text><text start="6727.091" dur="1.7">&quot;and I&apos;m so much better for it,</text><text start="6728.791" dur="1.253">&quot;because now I&apos;m interested in this,</text><text start="6730.044" dur="1.678">&quot;and I went to a retreat, and I did this.&quot;</text><text start="6731.722" dur="3.812">So you can see the virtuous stuff happen.</text><text start="6735.534" dur="2.062">So the question then that you bring up is</text><text start="6737.596" dur="2.039">can it be optimized actually in a way</text><text start="6739.635" dur="2.332">that that&apos;s the endpoint
you&apos;re actually looking for,</text><text start="6741.967" dur="4.265">that Lectical Score that
Zak Stein, you said,</text><text start="6746.232" dur="1.721">is working on in development.
- [Daniel] Yeah.</text><text start="6747.953" dur="1.836">Zak could be a great guy
to have on your show-</text><text start="6749.789" dur="1.336">- [Zubin] We&apos;ll have to do it.
- [Daniel] To discuss it.</text><text start="6751.125" dur="1.452">Tristan would be a great
guy to have on your show,</text><text start="6752.577" dur="1.617">because YouTube made some adjustments</text><text start="6754.194" dur="2.599">based on some of the
criticism that happened,</text><text start="6756.793" dur="2.26">and I don&apos;t, he knows this
topic much better than I do</text><text start="6759.053" dur="1.457">in terms of where adjustments were made,</text><text start="6760.51" dur="1.539">and where things have
actually progressed, and-</text><text start="6762.049" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] I&apos;d love to hear that.</text><text start="6762.882" dur="2.798">- [Daniel] And where
they could progress more.</text><text start="6765.68" dur="2.024">And I can, like there are reasons</text><text start="6767.704" dur="1.699">that you don&apos;t wanna
optimize for Lectical Score.</text><text start="6769.403" dur="1.716">That&apos;s why I said it&apos;s just
the beginning of a thinking,</text><text start="6771.119" dur="2.113">because if a Lectical
Score is the only thing</text><text start="6773.232" dur="1.417">you optimize for,</text><text start="6775.638" dur="3.685">someone who has more
advanced theory of mind-</text><text start="6779.323" dur="1.603">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] Without necessarily</text><text start="6780.926" dur="2.096">more advanced compassion, or embodiment,</text><text start="6783.022" dur="1.314">can be a more effective sociopath-</text><text start="6784.336" dur="1.035">- [Zubin] Psychopath, yeah.
- [Daniel] Yeah.</text><text start="6785.371" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] Exactly.</text><text start="6786.204" dur="1.5">- [Daniel] And so,</text><text start="6791.059" dur="1.759">I don&apos;t think you want to optimize</text><text start="6792.818" dur="2.877">for anything measurable, right?</text><text start="6795.695" dur="3.091">The thing that is measurable
will have externalities.</text><text start="6798.786" dur="3.498">Even a weighted algorithm of
N measurable things will have</text><text start="6802.284" dur="1.887">stuff that&apos;s really important
that&apos;s not included in it</text><text start="6804.171" dur="1.15">that if you&apos;re optimizing for</text><text start="6805.321" dur="1.109">you&apos;ll end up having the externality.</text><text start="6806.43" dur="2.645">So you can optimize,
but you want a process</text><text start="6809.075" dur="1.424">that what you&apos;re optimizing for is</text><text start="6810.499" dur="2.243">itself being continuously iterated.</text><text start="6812.742" dur="1.117">- [Zubin] A recursive process</text><text start="6813.859" dur="1.776">with the optimization parameters.</text><text start="6815.635" dur="1.932">- [Daniel] Where the externalities
of what&apos;s being harmed</text><text start="6817.567" dur="3.893">by the optimization are
continuously being internalized.</text><text start="6821.46" dur="1.653">But that means you also
need a governance system</text><text start="6823.113" dur="1.661">that can do that, which
means you can&apos;t be bound</text><text start="6824.774" dur="1.626">to something like fiduciary responsibility</text><text start="6826.4" dur="1.12">for profit maximization.</text><text start="6827.52" dur="3.28">- [Zubin] Okay, okay, so
to internalize the harms</text><text start="6830.8" dur="1.489">that are being generated, man,</text><text start="6832.289" dur="3.719">that requires a whole different
way of doing things, right?</text><text start="6836.008" dur="3.23">Because if the fossil fuel
industry had to internalize</text><text start="6839.238" dur="1.628">the environmental harm of their actions,</text><text start="6840.866" dur="2.269">it would be a very different industry.</text><text start="6843.135" dur="4.18">I mean, how do you even begin
to think about doing that?</text><text start="6847.315" dur="1.109">- [Daniel] I mean, it&apos;s interesting.</text><text start="6848.424" dur="2.399">You&apos;d actually have to
have a process to do that,</text><text start="6850.823" dur="2.789">because if you mandated today</text><text start="6853.612" dur="2.894">that the fossil fuels
industry had to internalize</text><text start="6856.506" dur="1.395">all of the costs it externalized,</text><text start="6857.901" dur="1.299">the civilization would collapse overnight.</text><text start="6859.2" dur="1.408">(Zubin laughs)
- [Zubin] Yeah, yeah.</text><text start="6860.608" dur="0.865">- [Daniel] Because-
- [Zubin] There&apos;d be</text><text start="6861.473" dur="1.238">no energy.</text><text start="6862.711" dur="1.376">- [Daniel] There&apos;d be no energy,</text><text start="6864.087" dur="2.601">because the energy&apos;s just
priced at how much it costs us</text><text start="6866.688" dur="1.339">to extract it-
- [Zubin] Right.</text><text start="6868.027" dur="1.404">- [Daniel] And then a
little margin to sell it.</text><text start="6869.431" dur="2.456">- [Zubin] Right, not the
common costs of the harm.</text><text start="6871.887" dur="1.56">- [Daniel] Not the costs that
took nature to produce it,</text><text start="6873.447" dur="1.732">or that it would take for
us to be able to produce it</text><text start="6875.179" dur="0.992">through some other method,</text><text start="6876.171" dur="1.86">and then the environmental
harm, social harms,</text><text start="6878.031" dur="1.218">whatever that happened.</text><text start="6879.249" dur="2.696">If I wanted to be able to
pay for all of those things,</text><text start="6881.945" dur="2.64">probably my cell phone is $10,000.</text><text start="6884.585" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] Right?</text><text start="6885.418" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] And so,</text><text start="6886.251" dur="2.891">there&apos;s a huge amount
of externalized costs,</text><text start="6889.142" dur="3.75">and energy is really
fundamental in this one.</text><text start="6895.223" dur="2.273">But that is a perverse incentive, right?</text><text start="6897.496" dur="1.827">There&apos;s a fundamental perverse incentive.</text><text start="6899.323" dur="3.46">So you would want to be able
to identify those externalities</text><text start="6902.783" dur="2.609">and internalize them where,</text><text start="6905.392" dur="3.358">and what that would do is
it would bind the incentive</text><text start="6908.75" dur="2.45">of the agent with the well-being
of the commons, right,</text><text start="6911.2" dur="2.667">that the company only got better</text><text start="6915.515" dur="1.967">when it was doing things that
were comprehensively better</text><text start="6917.482" dur="2.123">for the world, not got better
while fucking the world</text><text start="6919.605" dur="1.605">in different ways.
- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="6921.21" dur="2.225">- [Daniel] So how do you
internalize externality,</text><text start="6923.435" dur="4.542">and make, and close
perverse incentive niches</text><text start="6927.977" dur="0.993">is one of the fundamental things</text><text start="6928.97" dur="1.644">humanity has us to get better at, right?</text><text start="6930.614" dur="1.402">Like we have to fundamentally change</text><text start="6932.016" dur="2.583">our socioeconomic systems to do</text><text start="6936.474" dur="3.005">perverse incentive minimizing
much better than they do.</text><text start="6939.479" dur="1.88">How to do that is a complex topic, but-</text><text start="6941.359" dur="1.826">- [Zubin] Hmm, and how
much of this do you think</text><text start="6943.185" dur="2.945">is gonna require new technology</text><text start="6946.13" dur="1.932">that enables this kind of thing?</text><text start="6948.062" dur="1.957">Like you said, like what Zak is working on</text><text start="6950.019" dur="2.096">with the machine learning
that can generate</text><text start="6952.115" dur="1.582">these Lectical Scores,</text><text start="6953.697" dur="3.785">versus how much of it is more related</text><text start="6957.482" dur="2.795">to your Sabbath point, which is-</text><text start="6960.277" dur="2.161">- [Daniel] That&apos;s a technology.</text><text start="6962.438" dur="1.631">Depending upon how you
wanna think of it, right?</text><text start="6964.069" dur="1.476">- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="6965.545" dur="1.96">- [Daniel] That&apos;s a social technology</text><text start="6967.505" dur="2.834">in the same way that whether
it&apos;s institutional marriage,</text><text start="6970.339" dur="2.267">or whether it&apos;s tribal council,</text><text start="6972.606" dur="2.001">or whether it&apos;s, you know, Sabbath,</text><text start="6974.607" dur="3.238">it&apos;s basically that is a technique.</text><text start="6977.845" dur="1.122">- [Zubin] Right, right, right, right-</text><text start="6978.967" dur="2.433">- [Daniel] That can be, that
also requires abstraction</text><text start="6981.4" dur="1.738">to understand why it&apos;s an important thing,</text><text start="6983.138" dur="1.968">and that can be taught and passed down.</text><text start="6985.106" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] Right.</text><text start="6985.939" dur="2.762">- [Daniel] So I think when

- [Zubin] Right,</text><text start="6995.51" dur="1.081">so that&apos;s what I was,</text><text start="6996.591" dur="1.012">that&apos;s what I was getting at.</text><text start="6997.603" dur="1.902">Does it require that sort of technology,</text><text start="6999.505" dur="4.194">meaning self-awareness, self-realization,</text><text start="7003.699" dur="1.817">self-improvement technologies,</text><text start="7005.516" dur="4.929">like sweat lodges, psychedelics,
guided psychedelic therapy,</text><text start="7010.445" dur="3.397">meditation, spirituality of
any kind, that sort of thing?</text><text start="7013.842" dur="4.5">Do you think that&apos;s necessary
for humanity to survive?</text><text start="7019.284" dur="2.139">- [Daniel] Just you&apos;ll appreciate this.</text><text start="7021.423" dur="3.2">The first time I got to do a sweat lodge,</text><text start="7024.623" dur="3.333">I was invited to do it on a reservation.</text><text start="7029.908" dur="4.262">The shaman leading it,
there was one point where,</text><text start="7034.17" dur="0.851">it was my first time there.</text><text start="7035.021" dur="2.051">There was another white guy there</text><text start="7037.072" dur="2.417">whose first time it was, who,</text><text start="7041.359" dur="2.656">about 3/4 of the way through,
freaked out at the heat,</text><text start="7044.015" dur="2.732">and kind of ran outta the thing screaming.</text><text start="7046.747" dur="3.226">And the old shaman was
sitting right next to me,</text><text start="7049.973" dur="0.908">and he whispered in my ear.</text><text start="7050.881" dur="2.226">He says, &quot;We never trust someone</text><text start="7053.107" dur="1.762">&quot;who would bail on the sweat lodge.&quot;</text><text start="7054.869" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] Oh!</text><text start="7055.702" dur="3.18">- [Daniel] &quot;Because if he&apos;s
so scared that it&apos;s bad,</text><text start="7058.882" dur="1.762">&quot;that this is too hot for humans,</text><text start="7060.644" dur="1.846">&quot;he just left us all in here.&quot;</text><text start="7062.49" dur="1.797">- [Zubin] Oh!
(Zubin laughs)</text><text start="7064.287" dur="3.105">- [Daniel] And so,
either he really doesn&apos;t,</text><text start="7067.392" dur="2.443">he really knows it&apos;s safe,
and he can&apos;t control his mind-</text><text start="7069.835" dur="1.34">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] Or he doesn&apos;t think</text><text start="7071.175" dur="1.524">it&apos;s safe, and he was
willing to save himself,</text><text start="7072.699" dur="1.414">and bail on everybody.
- [Zubin] Wow.</text><text start="7074.113" dur="1.814">- [Daniel] So you could see
there was a social technology-</text><text start="7075.927" dur="1.459">- [Zubin] Yeah, yeah, yeah-
- [Daniel] Right,</text><text start="7077.386" dur="1.969">where it&apos;s gonna get hot
enough that you know,</text><text start="7079.355" dur="1.973">because the guys who&apos;ve
been doing it before</text><text start="7081.328" dur="1.882">of generation, generation,
you know intellectually</text><text start="7083.21" dur="1.556">it&apos;s not gonna hurt you, but
it&apos;s gonna get hot enough</text><text start="7084.766" dur="1.116">that it feels like it&apos;s gonna hurt you.</text><text start="7085.882" dur="0.991">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] Which means</text><text start="7086.873" dur="2.362">that you have to watch that
fear and not succumb to it.</text><text start="7089.235" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="7090.068" dur="2.144">- [Daniel] And you&apos;re all in it together,</text><text start="7092.212" dur="2.959">and you are experiencing
a shared hormesis, right?</text><text start="7095.171" dur="1.275">Like you&apos;re overcoming
some difficult thing,</text><text start="7096.446" dur="0.833">but all together.</text><text start="7097.279" dur="1.537">There&apos;s also, there&apos;s
a million other aspects</text><text start="7098.816" dur="2.657">that we can be like oh, wow,</text><text start="7101.473" dur="1.319">there was a really fuckin&apos; potent,</text><text start="7102.792" dur="1.236">insightful thing-
- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="7104.028" dur="1.051">- [Daniel] That they figured out</text><text start="7105.079" dur="2.178">that we have not replaced, right?</text><text start="7107.257" dur="1.558">We&apos;ve lost a lot of those things,</text><text start="7108.815" dur="1.481">and we don&apos;t have replacements,</text><text start="7110.296" dur="3.083">and whether it was that, or you know,</text><text start="7114.942" dur="2.5">we could go into all the
types of rites of passage</text><text start="7117.442" dur="3.399">and tribal technologies, but
they weren&apos;t for no reason,</text><text start="7120.841" dur="1.173">and they weren&apos;t just frivolous.</text><text start="7122.014" dur="2.613">They serve fundamental roles
to the social coherence.</text><text start="7124.627" dur="2.409">- [Zubin] It&apos;s funny because,
you know, when I was younger,</text><text start="7127.036" dur="2.347">I was much more of a
scientific reductionist.</text><text start="7129.383" dur="1.568">I thought pretty much
everything could be boiled down</text><text start="7130.951" dur="4.005">to processes that are
explicable in the third person,</text><text start="7134.956" dur="1.856">and its sort of domain,</text><text start="7136.812" dur="2.987">and rituals like that, I always thought,</text><text start="7139.799" dur="2.185">including religion, including
cathedrals, including,</text><text start="7141.984" dur="1.046">&quot;What a waste of money.</text><text start="7143.03" dur="0.841">&quot;Why are we doing this?</text><text start="7143.871" dur="2.343">&quot;These are dumb,&quot; even marriages,
like this whole ceremony,</text><text start="7146.214" dur="1.542">like, &quot;Let&apos;s just go
have a civil ceremony.</text><text start="7147.756" dur="1.51">&quot;This is just dumb.&quot;</text><text start="7149.266" dur="3.164">Boy, was I completely wrong.</text><text start="7152.43" dur="1.39">The older I get, the more I realize</text><text start="7153.82" dur="2.392">these are crucial interwoven fabrics</text><text start="7156.212" dur="2.651">of human development
and social development</text><text start="7158.863" dur="1.879">and all the things you just said.</text><text start="7160.742" dur="3.181">So, and again, I constantly talk</text><text start="7163.923" dur="2.759">about this meditation retreat,
because it&apos;s the most,</text><text start="7166.682" dur="1.122">it&apos;s the easiest thing I can talk about,</text><text start="7167.804" dur="1.026">it&apos;s the most recent.</text><text start="7168.83" dur="2.004">This idea that you get 30 people together,</text><text start="7170.834" dur="0.833">there was a small group,</text><text start="7171.667" dur="2.304">and a lot of them were my
supporters on the show,</text><text start="7173.971" dur="1.252">but they&apos;d been drawn to it,</text><text start="7175.223" dur="1.593">because they feel the
call to do this thing,</text><text start="7176.816" dur="2.116">and this guy, Angelo
DiLullo, who&apos;s a physician</text><text start="7178.932" dur="2.112">who wrote this book actually, &quot;Awake,&quot;</text><text start="7181.044" dur="1.85">about enlightenment, awakening,</text><text start="7182.894" dur="2.526">and it&apos;s really kind of a
zen-influenced kind of thing,</text><text start="7185.42" dur="2.352">and long story short, we went there,</text><text start="7187.772" dur="1.423">didn&apos;t know what to expect,</text><text start="7189.195" dur="2.445">silence, but in the evening
we would do group activities,</text><text start="7191.64" dur="2.811">and those group activities
were, everyone was reluctant.</text><text start="7194.451" dur="1.578">They&apos;re like, &quot;What, we&apos;re
gonna do improv comedy?</text><text start="7196.029" dur="1.385">&quot;We&apos;re gonna do what?</text><text start="7197.414" dur="3.731">&quot;This kind of circling and
storytelling and emotion work?&quot;</text><text start="7201.145" dur="4.75">It was the most connected,
open, amazing experience,</text><text start="7205.895" dur="2.405">and it pulls into the real world,</text><text start="7208.3" dur="1.444">kind of like I went to Whole Foods</text><text start="7209.744" dur="2.847">to order a slice of pizza, and I was so,</text><text start="7212.591" dur="2.322">I felt so connected to
the guy making the pizza</text><text start="7214.913" dur="2.226">who was having, looked like
he was having a bad day,</text><text start="7217.139" dur="1.391">that he could feel that energy.</text><text start="7218.53" dur="1.987">I mean, there was like this
nonverbal communication</text><text start="7220.517" dur="2.431">that happens, and he just
gave me the biggest slice.</text><text start="7222.948" dur="1.502">He&apos;s like, &quot;Hey, thanks,&quot;
and I&apos;m like, &quot;Thank you!&quot;</text><text start="7224.45" dur="2.54">I mean, this crazy,
stupid, intangible stuff</text><text start="7226.99" dur="3.089">that sounds woo-woo, but
it&apos;s absolutely real.</text><text start="7230.079" dur="2.228">So that&apos;s why I ask like how important is</text><text start="7232.307" dur="2.458">that sort of technology, you know?</text><text start="7234.765" dur="4.25">- [Daniel] So it&apos;s critical,
and it&apos;s not like you-</text><text start="7240.944" dur="2.166">- [Zubin] &apos;Cause we&apos;ve
lost it to some degree.</text><text start="7243.11" dur="1.583">- [Daniel] Totally.</text><text start="7245.785" dur="1.25">It&apos;s necessary,</text><text start="7248.644" dur="3.339">but it&apos;s not sufficient if
we were to still be making</text><text start="7251.983" dur="2.451">physical tech that is also
conditioning human psyche</text><text start="7254.434" dur="2.998">and values and conferring power
that was doing the opposite,</text><text start="7257.432" dur="1.936">but with exponential tech influence scale-</text><text start="7259.368" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] Push and pull.</text><text start="7260.201" dur="3.151">- [Daniel] So we have to be designing</text><text start="7263.352" dur="3.5">the tech differently on the physical side,</text><text start="7267.735" dur="1.955">designing the incentive systems</text><text start="7269.69" dur="2.202">and the deterrent systems differently,</text><text start="7271.892" dur="4.231">and working at the purely psychospiritual,</text><text start="7276.123" dur="1.269">cognitive culture level.</text><text start="7277.392" dur="3.488">And so, if you think about
the way Marvin Harris talked</text><text start="7280.88" dur="2.9">about society, or any
civilization being a function</text><text start="7283.78" dur="1.319">of three interacting things,</text><text start="7285.099" dur="2.117">you have an infrastructure,
a social structure,</text><text start="7287.216" dur="1.388">and a superstructure.</text><text start="7288.604" dur="3.25">The infrastructure is the physical tech</text><text start="7292.818" dur="1.79">that mediates our physical needs</text><text start="7294.608" dur="1.19">and relationship with the physical world,</text><text start="7295.798" dur="3.782">so water, food,
transportation, production,</text><text start="7299.58" dur="2.895">waste management, all that kind of stuff,</text><text start="7302.475" dur="3.266">and obviously, all of the technosphere.</text><text start="7305.741" dur="2.329">The social system is basically</text><text start="7308.07" dur="1.148">the collective agreement field,</text><text start="7309.218" dur="2.5">so government, law, economics.</text><text start="7312.903" dur="3.184">The superstructure is kind like culture.</text><text start="7316.087" dur="1.628">It&apos;s like what is the good life</text><text start="7317.715" dur="1.209">that we&apos;re ordinating towards?</text><text start="7318.924" dur="3.499">What is the existential
reason for any of it?</text><text start="7322.423" dur="1.502">What is the ethical basis?</text><text start="7323.925" dur="2.925">And so, we can see that
religion has become</text><text start="7326.85" dur="0.833">pretty hollowed out.</text><text start="7327.683" dur="1.997">We can see that patriotism,
that most of the things</text><text start="7329.68" dur="1.967">that bound someone to
more than themselves,</text><text start="7331.647" dur="1.774">and maybe just their immediate family,</text><text start="7333.421" dur="2.0">are pretty hollowed out.</text><text start="7336.28" dur="1.187">And they&apos;re replaced with, you know,</text><text start="7337.467" dur="2.483">you talk about kind of the quasi-religions</text><text start="7339.95" dur="2.877">that are where people have
some kind of tribal identity</text><text start="7342.827" dur="1.206">that feels like it&apos;s associated</text><text start="7344.033" dur="2.352">to some preventing the rapture,</text><text start="7346.385" dur="3.369">and making some kind of
better heaven on earth,</text><text start="7349.754" dur="3.508">or whatever possible, but
they&apos;re shitty religions, right?</text><text start="7353.262" dur="4.644">The new ones are fairly poorly
designed for the purposes.</text><text start="7357.906" dur="0.88">(Zubin laughs)
- [Zubin] Right.</text><text start="7358.786" dur="3.25">- [Daniel] But while Harris argued that</text><text start="7363.697" dur="2.869">infrastructure drives
changes in social structure</text><text start="7366.566" dur="2.2">and superstructure, there
are other social philosophers</text><text start="7368.766" dur="2.902">who will argue why each one
has causal arrows pointing</text><text start="7371.668" dur="2.031">in the other directions,
and it&apos;s all true.</text><text start="7373.699" dur="2.612">So what we could say is how to make</text><text start="7376.311" dur="4.128">a fundamentally viable
civilization requires</text><text start="7380.439" dur="2.912">a certain amount of changes
in all three simultaneously</text><text start="7383.351" dur="3.25">that lead to a virtuous process.</text><text start="7386.601" dur="1.917">Now, my social systems,</text><text start="7390.885" dur="2.227">let&apos;s just go ahead and
take government as a basis,</text><text start="7393.112" dur="1.912">or you know, governing institutions,</text><text start="7395.024" dur="2.761">&apos;cause the market will
create a bunch of incentives,</text><text start="7397.785" dur="3.48">but it&apos;ll have incentives
to do some things</text><text start="7401.265" dur="2.223">that suck for the whole,
which is why we have the idea</text><text start="7403.488" dur="2.019">of rule of law that we
can collectively say no,</text><text start="7405.507" dur="1.18">we don&apos;t wanna cut all the trees down.</text><text start="7406.687" dur="0.91">We want national forests,</text><text start="7407.597" dur="3.993">or we don&apos;t want organ
markets, or whatever it is.</text><text start="7411.59" dur="1.342">So we&apos;ll make a law around that thing,</text><text start="7412.932" dur="2.993">and then we&apos;ll give something
like monopoly of violence</text><text start="7415.925" dur="4.281">to be able to enshrine rule
of law and do enforcement.</text><text start="7420.206" dur="4.083">So that&apos;s able to basically
bind market and tech.</text><text start="7425.338" dur="1.15">It&apos;s not anymore, right?</text><text start="7426.488" dur="1.46">It&apos;s been hollowed out in a
way where it really can&apos;t,</text><text start="7427.948" dur="1.089">and that&apos;s important.</text><text start="7429.037" dur="2.004">But if that is not derived,</text><text start="7431.041" dur="2.922">that social structure that is designed</text><text start="7433.963" dur="3.067">to guide the infrastructure
and the power of it,</text><text start="7437.03" dur="2.331">if that social structure isn&apos;t derived</text><text start="7439.361" dur="1.728">from the superstructure, right,</text><text start="7441.089" dur="3.06">which is that the consent of the govern is</text><text start="7444.149" dur="1.945">where the power of the
government comes from,</text><text start="7446.094" dur="1.601">that it is a government of, for,</text><text start="7447.695" dur="2.958">and by a comprehensively
educated citizenry,</text><text start="7450.653" dur="3.135">then it will be authoritarian.</text><text start="7453.788" dur="3.878">And so, either you don&apos;t get institutions</text><text start="7457.666" dur="2.742">that can manage the complexity,
and you get catastrophes,</text><text start="7460.408" dur="3.547">or you do get institutions
that can manage the complexity,</text><text start="7463.955" dur="4.133">and they create order through imposition,</text><text start="7468.088" dur="1.524">and they&apos;re oppressive.</text><text start="7469.612" dur="1.552">So you either get
catastrophes on one side,</text><text start="7471.164" dur="3.903">or dystopias on the other,
or you have to actually</text><text start="7475.067" dur="2.773">have a culture that is
developing the capacity</text><text start="7477.84" dur="1.779">to make sense of the world individually</text><text start="7479.619" dur="2.759">and together to meaning-make
the world individually</text><text start="7482.378" dur="2.053">and together to be able to
do choice-making individually</text><text start="7484.431" dur="3.614">and together, so that a
comprehensively educated,</text><text start="7488.045" dur="3.345">informed, capable of post-cynical,</text><text start="7491.39" dur="3.248">good faith communication
population engaging with each other</text><text start="7494.638" dur="4.464">can create and oversight
and watchdog institutions</text><text start="7499.102" dur="4.411">that have the capacity to
engage and bind the technology,</text><text start="7503.513" dur="1.229">so that we are safe stewards</text><text start="7504.742" dur="3.305">for the power of exponential technology.</text><text start="7508.047" dur="1.995">- [Zubin] All of those things
have to kind of happen.</text><text start="7510.042" dur="1.259">That&apos;s the thing, they have to happen</text><text start="7511.301" dur="2.402">interwoven, interpenetrating.</text><text start="7513.703" dur="1.541">It can&apos;t just be one, or the other,</text><text start="7515.244" dur="2.009">and again, I feel like, you know,</text><text start="7517.253" dur="1.505">I&apos;m gonna quote Iain McGilchrist,</text><text start="7518.758" dur="1.821">who&apos;s written a book,
&quot;Master and His Emissary,&quot;</text><text start="7520.579" dur="1.58">about the difference between
the right and the left brain</text><text start="7522.159" dur="4.154">and how the left brain
really as the emissary</text><text start="7526.313" dur="2.295">that now thinks it&apos;s the master</text><text start="7528.608" dur="1.887">really loves to take parts</text><text start="7530.495" dur="3.345">and work on parts and make
wholes out of the parts</text><text start="7533.84" dur="2.266">instead of looking at a whole,</text><text start="7536.106" dur="1.82">whereas the right brain is silent,</text><text start="7537.926" dur="2.079">doesn&apos;t really use direct language,</text><text start="7540.005" dur="3.467">but it sees things relationally,

bureaucratic, left-brain,</text><text start="7550.517" dur="3.882">kind of absolute certainty,

avoiding catastrophic risk.</text><text start="7567.782" dur="3.5">I mean, I&apos;m curious your thoughts on that.</text><text start="7573.608" dur="1.097">- [Daniel] If people haven&apos;t seen &apos;em,</text><text start="7574.705" dur="2.821">everybody should watch the dialogues</text><text start="7577.526" dur="2.028">between David Bohm and Krishnamurti.</text><text start="7579.554" dur="1.306">- [Zubin] Oh, wow.</text><text start="7580.86" dur="2.741">- [Daniel] Some of my most
favorite dialogues ever,</text><text start="7583.601" dur="2.583">and David Bohm is talking about</text><text start="7587.551" dur="1.379">&quot;Wholeness and the Implicate Order&quot;</text><text start="7588.93" dur="2.934">and why it is a fragment, and you know,</text><text start="7591.864" dur="1.75">if people don&apos;t know,</text><text start="7595.544" dur="1.986">one of the top physicists</text><text start="7597.53" dur="3.892">who advanced quantum
mechanics following Einstein,</text><text start="7601.422" dur="2.917">and, but also a really
deep philosophic thinker.</text><text start="7604.339" dur="1.373">And so, the dialogues between he</text><text start="7605.712" dur="2.277">and Krishnamurti were super
interesting on these topics.</text><text start="7607.989" dur="0.905">- [Zubin] I&apos;ve heard about this.</text><text start="7608.894" dur="1.867">Supposed to be remarkable.
- [Daniel] Yeah.</text><text start="7610.761" dur="2.471">And Krishnamurti was,
of course, always asking</text><text start="7613.232" dur="1.811">what is the fundamental basis of conflict,</text><text start="7615.043" dur="2.238">and what would it take
to have a civilization</text><text start="7617.281" dur="1.115">that could actually deal with conflict-</text><text start="7618.396" dur="1.672">- [Zubin] By the way,
who was Krishnamurti?</text><text start="7620.068" dur="2.417">Maybe fill these guys in, so.</text><text start="7623.695" dur="1.54">- [Daniel] I mean, there&apos;s
a whole interesting story</text><text start="7625.235" dur="2.452">of his relationship with
the Theosophical Society,</text><text start="7627.687" dur="2.961">and like that, but just a very interesting</text><text start="7630.648" dur="2.262">20th century thinker that
came from what would&apos;ve seemed</text><text start="7632.91" dur="1.994">like a esoteric spiritual tradition,</text><text start="7634.904" dur="3.84">but was a really, really keen intellect,</text><text start="7638.744" dur="2.083">and was really focused on</text><text start="7644.14" dur="3.026">what would a civilization
that could actually deal</text><text start="7647.166" dur="2.561">with conflict well
require in the development</text><text start="7649.727" dur="2.568">of people individually and at scale</text><text start="7652.295" dur="3.008">as our capacity for the consequentiality</text><text start="7655.303" dur="2.434">of conflict is growing, right?</text><text start="7657.737" dur="2.709">Post the bomb, it&apos;s a different story,</text><text start="7660.446" dur="2.472">because conflict before
had a limited scope</text><text start="7662.918" dur="1.73">of how many people would be harmed.</text><text start="7664.648" dur="1.595">And now, you have a situation</text><text start="7666.243" dur="1.87">where conflict can
escalate to kill everybody.</text><text start="7668.113" dur="1.526">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] And obviously,</text><text start="7669.639" dur="2.115">that was when you had one
type of catastrophe weapon.</text><text start="7671.754" dur="1.833">Now, with bio-weapons,</text><text start="7675.385" dur="1.635">and AI weapons, and cyber weapons,</text><text start="7677.02" dur="3.585">and drone weapons, we have
way more catastrophic weapons</text><text start="7680.605" dur="2.685">in a much more highly
interconnected, fragile world</text><text start="7683.29" dur="2.213">with a fragile ecosystem
close to planetary boundaries</text><text start="7685.503" dur="1.513">with way more actors that have it,</text><text start="7687.016" dur="2.812">where you can&apos;t do mutually
assured destruction.</text><text start="7689.828" dur="1.395">So if you don&apos;t figure out</text><text start="7691.223" dur="1.93">how do we deal with conflict better,</text><text start="7693.153" dur="1.049">so of course, one answer is,</text><text start="7694.202" dur="2.388">well, just ubiquitous
surveillance and control everyone,</text><text start="7696.59" dur="2.617">which is the dystopia to
avoid the catastrophe.</text><text start="7699.207" dur="3.245">The other answer has to
be a authentically better</text><text start="7702.452" dur="3.333">self-organizing collective intelligence.</text><text start="7706.747" dur="2.766">And so, this, you know,
Krishnamurti was obviously prescient</text><text start="7709.513" dur="1.622">seeing this, and being like,</text><text start="7711.135" dur="2.208">&quot;We actually have to deal with the origins</text><text start="7713.343" dur="0.866">&quot;of conflict better.&quot;</text><text start="7714.209" dur="4.772">And so, you can get into
Marx&apos;s ideas of class conflict,</text><text start="7718.981" dur="2.47">and Girard&apos;s ideas of
mimetic desire, conflict,</text><text start="7721.451" dur="1.523">and you know, you kind of have to go deep</text><text start="7722.974" dur="1.931">on where those come from
to say what would it take</text><text start="7724.905" dur="1.323">to deal with them well-
- [Zubin] Right.</text><text start="7726.228" dur="2.833">- [Daniel] But Bohm was looking at</text><text start="7732.782" dur="1.5">the orientation of</text><text start="7739.444" dur="3.689">a mind that mostly thinks in words,</text><text start="7743.133" dur="3.642">of Western mind, you know, in particular,</text><text start="7746.775" dur="3.838">to break reality into parts,
and make sure that our word,</text><text start="7750.613" dur="2.411">the symbol that would
correspond with the ground there</text><text start="7753.024" dur="1.899">corresponded with the things
that it was supposed to,</text><text start="7754.923" dur="2.204">and not the other things, so
try to draw rigorous boundaries</text><text start="7757.127" dur="1.899">to, you know, divide everything up,</text><text start="7759.026" dur="2.496">led to us fundamentally relating</text><text start="7761.522" dur="1.9">to everything as parts first.</text><text start="7763.422" dur="1.752">And so, then you get stuff
that doesn&apos;t make sense.</text><text start="7765.174" dur="0.833">Like you bring parts together,</text><text start="7766.007" dur="1.589">and there&apos;s some new property
that none of the parts have,</text><text start="7767.596" dur="0.986">and you have to call it emergence,</text><text start="7768.582" dur="0.916">and it seems kind of wacky,</text><text start="7769.498" dur="2.294">but it was only because
that property was there</text><text start="7771.792" dur="2.015">from the beginning and
you took it into parts-</text><text start="7773.807" dur="1.173">- [Zubin] Parts-
- [Daniel] And-</text><text start="7774.98" dur="0.876">- [Zubin] Oh, fascinating!</text><text start="7775.856" dur="3.573">So you call it emergence because
you started with the parts,</text><text start="7779.429" dur="2.483">and you built it up, whereas
it was a whole to begin with,</text><text start="7781.912" dur="2.631">and ah, so what was missing,
you&apos;re calling emergence.</text><text start="7784.543" dur="1.584">- [Daniel] Exactly.
- [Zubin] Ah, fascinating.</text><text start="7786.127" dur="1.322">(Zubin laughs)</text><text start="7787.449" dur="4.085">- [Daniel] And so, whether
you have one country trying</text><text start="7791.534" dur="2.933">to benefit itself at the
expense of another country,</text><text start="7794.467" dur="2.338">or all of the countries
trying to grow their GDP</text><text start="7796.805" dur="1.877">at the expense of the ecosystem,</text><text start="7798.682" dur="2.636">or a proposition that
is benefiting something,</text><text start="7801.318" dur="2.286">but harming something else,

you&apos;re trying to optimize for</text><text start="7806.177" dur="2.162">in healthcare that causes
iatrogenic cascades</text><text start="7808.339" dur="2.062">to damaging something else, or whatever,</text><text start="7810.401" dur="3.707">the highly interconnected
world where the solution,</text><text start="7814.108" dur="1.44">or what you&apos;re optimizing for,</text><text start="7815.548" dur="2.636">is made a narrow subset of everything.</text><text start="7818.184" dur="0.915">The thing that you&apos;re doing is</text><text start="7819.099" dur="1.416">still interacting with complexity.</text><text start="7820.515" dur="2.308">So whatever it&apos;s affecting
outside of what you&apos;re intending</text><text start="7822.823" dur="1.721">to affect will be negative externalities.</text><text start="7824.544" dur="1.094">Some people will care about those.</text><text start="7825.638" dur="0.833">They&apos;ll respond to those.</text><text start="7826.471" dur="2.434">You&apos;ll keep driving conflict,

exponential externality.</text><text start="7837.0" dur="2.134">So you have to do a better

include environmental stuff,</text><text start="7852.86" dur="1.041">so we have to add a CO2 thing,</text><text start="7853.901" dur="1.364">but that doesn&apos;t include nitrogen, so-</text><text start="7855.265" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] Parts, parts, parts.</text><text start="7856.098" dur="1.273">- [Daniel] You keep adding,</text><text start="7857.371" dur="1.514">and yet there will always be stuff</text><text start="7858.885" dur="2.198">in some finite set of

(Zubin laughs)</text><text start="7906.337" dur="4.301">how do we not have metrics that
create optimization systems</text><text start="7910.638" dur="1.214">that then bind us, right,</text><text start="7911.852" dur="2.99">where now the board wants to hold the CEO</text><text start="7914.842" dur="3.41">to quarterly profit metrics to be able</text><text start="7918.252" dur="2.204">to get the money back to the

metrics that matter,</text><text start="7936.154" dur="1.748">and be able to progressively
internalize that,</text><text start="7937.902" dur="1.6">which means we have to
create governance structures</text><text start="7939.502" dur="2.018">that can orient around
the ability to do that.</text><text start="7941.52" dur="1.55">- [Zubin] Okay.</text><text start="7943.07" dur="1.785">- [Daniel] Which also means
we have to create minds</text><text start="7944.855" dur="1.922">that are oriented to do that,</text><text start="7946.777" dur="2.522">and know that other minds will

do a good job of healthcare</text><text start="8115.209" dur="2.959">without addressing agricultural practices</text><text start="8118.168" dur="1.952">that demineralize soil?</text><text start="8120.12" dur="1.303">- [Zubin] Mmm, no.</text><text start="8121.423" dur="1.036">- [Daniel] No.
- [Zubin] How can you?</text><text start="8122.459" dur="0.833">- [Daniel] And so, if you have</text><text start="8123.292" dur="1.634">ubiquitously demineralized soil,</text><text start="8124.926" dur="1.448">and you use NPK to get something</text><text start="8126.374" dur="1.559">that looks like a vegetable,</text><text start="8127.933" dur="2.321">but doesn&apos;t have the same
trace mineral density,</text><text start="8130.254" dur="1.239">and those trace minerals are important</text><text start="8131.493" dur="1.434">for the gazillion things,</text><text start="8132.927" dur="1.826">are you gonna have a bunch
of subclinical deficiencies</text><text start="8134.753" dur="1.397">that cause, you know, problems?</text><text start="8136.15" dur="2.517">And similarly, now you&apos;re
gonna cover it in glyphosate,</text><text start="8138.667" dur="2.466">and so, now you&apos;ll have deficiency</text><text start="8141.133" dur="2.917">and toxicity simultaneously, right?</text><text start="8145.053" dur="2.403">And can you have something like Hostess</text><text start="8147.456" dur="1.883">and Coca-Cola&apos;s multi-billion dollar,</text><text start="8149.339" dur="3.268">multinational advertising conglomerate,</text><text start="8152.607" dur="3.729">you know, capacities
that are optimized for,</text><text start="8156.336" dur="2.012">you know, addiction optimization?</text><text start="8158.348" dur="1.303">Like can you have that thing,</text><text start="8159.651" dur="2.343">and have a maximally healthy
population at the same time?</text><text start="8161.994" dur="2.69">- [Zubin] Which also then
generates an epiphenomenon</text><text start="8164.684" dur="2.419">of a big pharmaceutical
company that is designed</text><text start="8167.103" dur="1.64">to then patch up the holes created</text><text start="8168.743" dur="2.64">by the addictive economy of our food</text><text start="8171.383" dur="2.479">and ecological mess.</text><text start="8173.862" dur="1.483">- [Daniel] Yeah, &apos;cause I
can just take the statin,</text><text start="8175.345" dur="1.183">and I can just take the insulin,</text><text start="8176.528" dur="2.458">and not have to actually
deal with the dietary thing.</text><text start="8178.986" dur="2.624">It&apos;s similarly a short-term, parts-based,</text><text start="8181.61" dur="1.199">you know, et cetera.
- [Zubin] Yup.</text><text start="8182.809" dur="3.162">- [Daniel] And you know, I think,</text><text start="8185.971" dur="1.993">the thing I think medicine
has done a particularly,</text><text start="8187.964" dur="2.046">like modern medicine has done
a particularly exceptional job</text><text start="8190.01" dur="3.033">at is things that have single-point cause,</text><text start="8193.043" dur="1.772">and where you can identify-
- [Zubin] Absolutely,</text><text start="8194.815" dur="3.211">when there&apos;s one gene, or
one protein, or one problem.</text><text start="8198.026" dur="1.932">- [Daniel] So acute medicine
is always like that, right?</text><text start="8199.958" dur="1.878">An acute poisoning, an acute infection,</text><text start="8201.836" dur="1.312">an acute injury is fuckin&apos; awesome.</text><text start="8203.148" dur="1.128">- [Zubin] Yeah, you&apos;re
stabbed in the neck?</text><text start="8204.276" dur="0.907">I can fix that.</text><text start="8205.183" dur="2.957">- [Daniel] And, but the
things that don&apos;t have</text><text start="8208.14" dur="3.214">a single cause, that have
multiple causes particularly,</text><text start="8211.354" dur="3.097">so complex causation, causal cascades</text><text start="8214.451" dur="1.28">that are delayed in time,</text><text start="8215.731" dur="2.19">and where they&apos;re not the
same in everybody, right?</text><text start="8217.921" dur="2.423">It&apos;s not even, it&apos;s these
three things that cause it,</text><text start="8220.344" dur="2.549">but it&apos;s some subset of
these thousands of things</text><text start="8222.893" dur="1.309">that end up causing.</text><text start="8224.202" dur="2.638">So the way I think about
complex chronic disease,</text><text start="8226.84" dur="1.437">whether we&apos;re talking
about neurodegenerative,</text><text start="8228.277" dur="4.223">or autoimmune, I don&apos;t think
there is such a thing as MS,</text><text start="8232.5" dur="2.214">or rheumatoid arthritis as a single thing,</text><text start="8234.714" dur="2.626">meaning that the same causal
cascade happened for everybody,</text><text start="8237.34" dur="1.862">right, which is why
sometimes that gene is there,</text><text start="8239.202" dur="1.809">and sometimes it isn&apos;t, and sometimes.</text><text start="8241.011" dur="3.465">I think of that more
as a set of biomarkers</text><text start="8244.476" dur="2.867">and a set of symptoms
that cluster together</text><text start="8247.343" dur="2.895">usefully for a diagnostic
code for insurance purposes,</text><text start="8250.238" dur="2.933">for regulatory purposes,
for pharmaceutical purposes,</text><text start="8253.171" dur="3.386">but where the pathophysiology
leading there was different,</text><text start="8256.557" dur="2.05">and which is why we don&apos;t
do a good job at curing them</text><text start="8258.607" dur="2.386">is &apos;cause we don&apos;t do a good
job at assessing the causation</text><text start="8260.993" dur="2.313">&apos;cause it&apos;s not single cause, right?</text><text start="8263.306" dur="1.179">It&apos;s a complex thing to figure out,</text><text start="8264.485" dur="2.176">which is why I think the
best stuff that&apos;s happening</text><text start="8266.661" dur="1.604">in functional medicine
is doing a better job.</text><text start="8268.265" dur="2.528">When you look at like the
work Bredesen is doing</text><text start="8270.793" dur="2.069">with Alzheimer&apos;s and dementia,</text><text start="8272.862" dur="3.359">and I think Perlmutter and others have</text><text start="8276.221" dur="3.718">kind of weighed in on some of that work,</text><text start="8279.939" dur="2.051">it&apos;s a personalized medicine approach</text><text start="8281.99" dur="1.099">to how to deal with it, &apos;cause it&apos;s not</text><text start="8283.089" dur="2.475">the exact same
pathophysiology in each case,</text><text start="8285.564" dur="2.191">but getting really interesting results.</text><text start="8287.755" dur="1.851">So for instance,</text><text start="8289.606" dur="2.089">and I&apos;m just playing
this out hypothetically,</text><text start="8291.695" dur="1.852">somebody has MS,</text><text start="8293.547" dur="4.379">and you do a really
detailed history intake,</text><text start="8297.926" dur="3.289">and you know, they had a head injury</text><text start="8301.215" dur="3.266">that maybe created subclinical TBI,</text><text start="8304.481" dur="2.809">meaning didn&apos;t show up
with morphological damage,</text><text start="8307.29" dur="1.25">but it would show up on a SPECT scan,</text><text start="8308.54" dur="2.319">or on a functional kind of EEG,</text><text start="8310.859" dur="4.136">and then they had mold
toxins in their house,</text><text start="8314.995" dur="2.816">and then they had a
really stressful divorce,</text><text start="8317.811" dur="1.684">and they&apos;ve had chronic
sugar kind of issues,</text><text start="8319.495" dur="3.074">and you get each one of those
causing dysregulatory dynamics</text><text start="8322.569" dur="1.474">that eventually can cluster that way,</text><text start="8324.043" dur="1.454">but in a slightly different thing.</text><text start="8325.497" dur="2.475">Might be rheumatoid,
autoimmune, or something else.</text><text start="8327.972" dur="3.285">But for someone else, it
was like Lyme disease,</text><text start="8331.257" dur="2.763">and a certain amount of
petrol toxin exposure,</text><text start="8334.02" dur="0.99">and some other set of things,</text><text start="8335.01" dur="1.475">and with more genetic precursor.</text><text start="8336.485" dur="1.083">So the way...</text><text start="8341.411" dur="3.493">So how to even think about
the physiologic causal aspects</text><text start="8344.904" dur="3.979">of it has to involve a
more complex epistemology.</text><text start="8348.883" dur="0.976">- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="8349.859" dur="2.799">And we don&apos;t train medical
students to do that.</text><text start="8352.658" dur="2.69">We train them in the reductionist
model as much as possible,</text><text start="8355.348" dur="2.518">turn things into parts.</text><text start="8357.866" dur="1.546">So that has to change.</text><text start="8359.412" dur="2.242">And that&apos;s part, it&apos;s gotta co-evolve</text><text start="8361.654" dur="1.05">with civilization change.</text><text start="8362.704" dur="2.632">It&apos;s gotta co-evolve with
societal and environmental change.</text><text start="8365.336" dur="1.563">It&apos;s gotta co-evolve with economic change,</text><text start="8366.899" dur="2.604">and social change, and
all the other things.</text><text start="8369.503" dur="4.167">And yet, what I find often
is society in its ills,</text><text start="8375.76" dur="2.332">the failures of civilization
actually often end up</text><text start="8378.092" dur="1.929">on the doorstep of the healthcare system,</text><text start="8380.021" dur="1.344">and then what it does
is it ripples through</text><text start="8381.365" dur="2.109">the actual healthcare worker population.</text><text start="8383.474" dur="1.858">So you know, we use terms like burnout.</text><text start="8385.332" dur="1.879">It&apos;s really a kind of
chronic moral injury,</text><text start="8387.211" dur="1.939">&apos;cause these are good people
who went in for good reasons,</text><text start="8389.15" dur="2.11">and they find themselves
unable to help people,</text><text start="8391.26" dur="2.437">because they&apos;re in a model
that doesn&apos;t allow it,</text><text start="8393.697" dur="3.386">and the holistic way of
looking at it is just,</text><text start="8397.083" dur="1.076">it&apos;s not rewarded.</text><text start="8398.159" dur="1.153">It&apos;s not paid for.</text><text start="8399.312" dur="2.745">You&apos;re paid to turn things
into parts, to bill by code.</text><text start="8402.057" dur="1.104">- [Daniel] Well, and I mean, you know,</text><text start="8403.161" dur="3.247">you&apos;ve mentioned that the
relationship to patent law,</text><text start="8406.408" dur="2.643">and regulatory process,</text><text start="8409.051" dur="2.103">and fiscal incentive all co-influence.</text><text start="8411.154" dur="1.882">In a way it&apos;s like it&apos;s not some bad guy.</text><text start="8413.036" dur="1.947">It&apos;s just the nature of
the system does that thing.</text><text start="8414.983" dur="1.927">- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="8416.91" dur="1.816">- [Daniel] If you wanna go through,</text><text start="8418.726" dur="1.973">if you have to go through
Phase III clinical trials</text><text start="8420.699" dur="1.084">to be able to get the thing approved,</text><text start="8421.783" dur="1.804">and that costs like a
billion dollars to do,</text><text start="8423.587" dur="0.894">especially when you amortize</text><text start="8424.481" dur="1.305">that some of them won&apos;t make it,</text><text start="8425.786" dur="1.434">so for a drug company
to get one that works,</text><text start="8427.22" dur="2.075">you have some of number that don&apos;t work,</text><text start="8429.295" dur="1.796">you have to be a big
fuckin&apos; company to be able</text><text start="8431.091" dur="2.047">to do that thing.</text><text start="8433.138" dur="2.19">And you can&apos;t just,</text><text start="8435.328" dur="2.131">insurance doesn&apos;t support
general health increase.</text><text start="8437.459" dur="2.654">It has to be disease,
so you diagnose diseases</text><text start="8440.113" dur="2.305">in particular ways for
kind of insurance purposes.</text><text start="8442.418" dur="3.959">And so, that whole
cluster of things means,</text><text start="8446.377" dur="2.9">and you&apos;re not gonna be able
to patent endogenous molecules,</text><text start="8449.277" dur="1.634">and increasing the things
that were there in youth</text><text start="8450.911" dur="2.691">anywhere near as easily, so
it&apos;s synthetic molecules.</text><text start="8453.602" dur="2.227">What&apos;s the chance that a deficiency</text><text start="8455.829" dur="2.042">in the synthetic molecule
was the causal reason</text><text start="8457.871" dur="0.872">that you got ill,</text><text start="8458.743" dur="1.904">that was not a part of your
evolutionary environment,</text><text start="8460.647" dur="1.133">or healthy people?</text><text start="8461.78" dur="1.629">- [Zubin] You don&apos;t have
a sertraline deficiency?</text><text start="8463.409" dur="1.769">(Daniel laughs)
A Zoloft deficiency?</text><text start="8465.178" dur="1.612">- [Daniel] It doesn&apos;t
even make sense, right?</text><text start="8466.79" dur="1.08">Like you would think okay, well,</text><text start="8467.87" dur="1.951">when the same person with
the same genome was healthy,</text><text start="8469.821" dur="1.519">what was happening
differently was a difference</text><text start="8471.34" dur="1.757">in endogenous molecules, right?</text><text start="8473.097" dur="1.645">So can we study the molecules of health,</text><text start="8474.742" dur="2.288">and how they proliferate?</text><text start="8477.03" dur="3.049">But that does require
changes in the regulatory-</text><text start="8480.079" dur="1.437">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] Epistemic,</text><text start="8481.516" dur="2.421">fiscal, et cetera process.</text><text start="8483.937" dur="2.27">And obviously, if the people
are all getting fed sugar,</text><text start="8486.207" dur="1.8">and stress, and isolation to begin with,</text><text start="8488.007" dur="1.816">they&apos;re fucked in the first place, right?</text><text start="8489.823" dur="1.308">- [Zubin] Yeah.
- [Daniel] And so,</text><text start="8491.131" dur="1.281">when I think about the future of medicine,</text><text start="8492.412" dur="2.667">I think about a system that
is mostly preventing illness,</text><text start="8495.079" dur="1.09">but it&apos;s not preventing illness.</text><text start="8496.169" dur="3.038">It&apos;s promoting health across
all of the dimensions.</text><text start="8499.207" dur="1.4">And of course, you can&apos;t define health.</text><text start="8500.607" dur="3.859">You can kind of roughly define
it, but it&apos;s that same thing,</text><text start="8504.466" dur="3.06">increased adaptive capacity
to an increased number</text><text start="8507.526" dur="1.002">of stressors of any kind.</text><text start="8508.528" dur="3.195">You can kind of roughly define it, right?</text><text start="8511.723" dur="1.12">But if you are promoting that,</text><text start="8512.843" dur="1.463">then there&apos;s very little hospital, right?</text><text start="8514.306" dur="0.953">It&apos;s mostly decentralized,</text><text start="8515.259" dur="0.97">in the same way we want education</text><text start="8516.229" dur="0.939">to be mostly decentralized.</text><text start="8517.168" dur="2.281">You want a civilization that&apos;s
developing humans writ large,</text><text start="8519.449" dur="1.327">and not just at the school.</text><text start="8520.776" dur="1.369">You want a civilization that&apos;s promoting</text><text start="8522.145" dur="2.752">the health of people writ
large, not just at the hospital.</text><text start="8524.897" dur="2.745">And then, when people
do come to the hospital,</text><text start="8527.642" dur="2.212">I would like it to be
much more like a temple.</text><text start="8529.854" dur="1.083">- [Zubin] Mmm, I agree.</text><text start="8530.937" dur="2.095">I&apos;ve said this, the future
of medicine is more shamanic</text><text start="8533.032" dur="3.365">than, you know, than procedural.</text><text start="8536.397" dur="1.62">- [Daniel] I mean, people
are gonna die there,</text><text start="8538.017" dur="1.178">and people are gonna be born there,</text><text start="8539.195" dur="1.326">and people are gonna have
near-death experience,</text><text start="8540.521" dur="1.118">and come back.</text><text start="8541.639" dur="1.045">If anything should be a temple,</text><text start="8542.684" dur="1.069">it should be a fuckin&apos; hospital.</text><text start="8543.753" dur="1.922">- [Zubin] Can I tell you
as somebody who&apos;s spent</text><text start="8545.675" dur="2.196">most of my life (laughs) it
feels like in a hospital,</text><text start="8547.871" dur="3.716">I mean, I&apos;m a hospitalist,
that&apos;s my specialty,</text><text start="8551.587" dur="2.21">the place is anything but
a temple in many ways,</text><text start="8553.797" dur="3.062">and it&apos;s only made a temple
by people&apos;s conscious efforts</text><text start="8556.859" dur="2.744">where you take a second to
realize you&apos;re in a sacred space</text><text start="8559.603" dur="1.333">with a patient who&apos;s dying,</text><text start="8560.936" dur="1.401">or with a family who&apos;s having the worst,</text><text start="8562.337" dur="2.144">you know, week of their
lives, or something like that.</text><text start="8564.481" dur="2.268">The then any space becomes sacred,</text><text start="8566.749" dur="2.458">but it requires the intentionality
of the person there,</text><text start="8569.207" dur="1.691">and if that person is so beaten down,</text><text start="8570.898" dur="4.421">is so obsessed with the
parts just to survive,</text><text start="8575.319" dur="2.344">then that gets taken
away, and they feel that,</text><text start="8577.663" dur="2.533">and they manifest it biopsychosocially
in their own disease.</text><text start="8580.196" dur="2.076">- [Daniel] Oh, this is why I
was mentioning the complexity</text><text start="8582.272" dur="1.777">of even looking at the physiology, right?</text><text start="8584.049" dur="3.386">So of course, looking at
the physiology complexly,</text><text start="8587.435" dur="4.677">like have I, am I looking at
the subclinical deficiencies,</text><text start="8592.112" dur="2.795">and subclinical toxicities,
and subclinical pathogenicity,</text><text start="8594.907" dur="1.804">am I looking at the
physiological structure,</text><text start="8596.711" dur="1.67">and their dentistry, and you know,</text><text start="8598.381" dur="1.994">subclinical brain patterns
in their SPECT scan,</text><text start="8600.375" dur="1.011">and whatever, all the things,</text><text start="8601.386" dur="1.826">some things that were
uncurable become curable</text><text start="8603.212" dur="1.651">when you really start to, or treatable,</text><text start="8604.863" dur="1.425">when you really start to go in deeper.</text><text start="8606.288" dur="1.809">But obviously I also have to be looking</text><text start="8608.097" dur="1.486">at their relationships, have
to be looking at their psyche,</text><text start="8609.583" dur="0.874">I have to look at the environment,</text><text start="8610.457" dur="1.494">because does their house have mold in it?</text><text start="8611.951" dur="1.394">I&apos;m not gonna necessarily get them better</text><text start="8613.345" dur="3.529">if I don&apos;t deal with
certain of those things.</text><text start="8616.874" dur="2.162">How long does it take
to do that intake well?</text><text start="8619.036" dur="1.111">(Zubin laughs)</text><text start="8620.147" dur="2.584">Like the doctors who I know
who do a good job of this-</text><text start="8622.731" dur="1.312">- [Zubin] Yeah, it&apos;s hours.</text><text start="8624.043" dur="1.596">- [Daniel] You have a five-hour intake.</text><text start="8625.639" dur="1.324">- [Zubin] Yeah.

do perfect variable isolation,</text><text start="8630.837" dur="1.116">and you really have to sense it,</text><text start="8631.953" dur="1.985">so how does the economics of that system</text><text start="8633.938" dur="1.018">that requires doctors that are</text><text start="8634.956" dur="1.545">way the fuck more trained-
- [Zubin] Yeah.</text><text start="8636.501" dur="1.233">- [Daniel] Than we currently have,</text><text start="8637.734" dur="1.676">and yet, with that much time investment?</text><text start="8639.41" dur="1.207">Well, obviously, you mostly just want</text><text start="8640.617" dur="1.234">to use the doctors a lot less,</text><text start="8641.851" dur="2.301">&apos;cause you have a system
that is promoting health,</text><text start="8644.152" dur="2.623">and then if they&apos;re also more trained,</text><text start="8646.775" dur="2.86">kind of to be able to do the
psychospiritual interface</text><text start="8649.635" dur="1.3">that is happening there,</text><text start="8650.935" dur="1.042">it&apos;s just a totally different vision.</text><text start="8651.977" dur="0.936">- [Zubin] It&apos;s a totally different thing,</text><text start="8652.913" dur="2.626">and the friends that I have
who do this sort of medicine,</text><text start="8655.539" dur="1.738">they&apos;re more in the concierge space.</text><text start="8657.277" dur="2.77">So you know, people pay a lot
of money for unlimited access</text><text start="8660.047" dur="1.162">and they&apos;ll do those five-hour things.</text><text start="8661.209" dur="1.187">They&apos;ll look at every aspect.</text><text start="8662.396" dur="1.62">No stone will be unturned.</text><text start="8664.016" dur="2.11">They&apos;ll come to the
house, that kind of thing,</text><text start="8666.126" dur="2.613">and it&apos;s unfortunately
the realm of the affluent.</text><text start="8668.739" dur="1.001">- [Daniel] Totally.</text><text start="8669.74" dur="2.24">- [Zubin] So how do, you
know, I think it&apos;s doable.</text><text start="8671.98" dur="0.889">In fact, I&apos;ve talked about it,</text><text start="8672.869" dur="1.639">this idea that you can actually do it,</text><text start="8674.508" dur="1.027">and it requires a team.</text><text start="8675.535" dur="1.062">It&apos;s not just a doctor.</text><text start="8676.597" dur="0.925">That&apos;s the other thing.</text><text start="8677.522" dur="2.684">You can&apos;t, you need an in
interdisciplinary group,</text><text start="8680.206" dur="1.942">where everybody&apos;s practicing the best</text><text start="8682.148" dur="1.445">that they&apos;re trained to do,</text><text start="8683.593" dur="2.787">and they&apos;re feeding back
to each other in a huddle,</text><text start="8686.38" dur="1.554">and we did that at our
clinic in last Vegas.</text><text start="8687.934" dur="1.715">I mean, it was this,
you had health coaches,</text><text start="8689.649" dur="1.196">who are drawn from that community,</text><text start="8690.845" dur="1.966">who know that population,
who speak that language,</text><text start="8692.811" dur="1.437">who know the hopes, dreams, and fears,</text><text start="8694.248" dur="2.247">and could get in people&apos;s heads,
and then you have doctors,</text><text start="8696.495" dur="1.306">nurses, nurse practitioner,</text><text start="8697.801" dur="2.284">a licensed clinical social
worker who does the mental health</text><text start="8700.085" dur="2.56">and care coordination and
all those other things,</text><text start="8702.645" dur="2.757">and we would call them nurse innovators.</text><text start="8705.402" dur="3.367">Why do we reduce nurses to pill pushers</text><text start="8708.769" dur="4.286">and data entry clerks when they
are so much more than that?</text><text start="8713.055" dur="2.1">They were self-selected
for being nurturing types.</text><text start="8715.155" dur="1.075">Like what are we doing?</text><text start="8716.23" dur="2.057">So all of that is solvable,</text><text start="8718.287" dur="1.68">but you need new, you need
all the things you said,</text><text start="8719.967" dur="3.547">the changes in incentive
structures, in social structures,</text><text start="8723.514" dur="3.008">in governance, in
regulatory stuff, all that.</text><text start="8726.522" dur="2.195">- [Daniel] Yeah, so I want the
number of nurses per capita</text><text start="8728.717" dur="1.474">to go way up.
- [Zubin] That would be nice.</text><text start="8730.191" dur="1.361">- [Daniel] I want the number
of doctors per capita to go up.</text><text start="8731.552" dur="1.919">I want the number of teachers
per capita to go way up,</text><text start="8733.471" dur="2.824">so that the students have much
more personalized attention,</text><text start="8736.295" dur="1.701">and I want the amount we
can train them to go up,</text><text start="8737.996" dur="1.853">so you can really fuckin&apos;
train those people,</text><text start="8739.849" dur="1.883">and really maximally talented ones,</text><text start="8741.732" dur="1.136">&apos;cause how are you gonna get</text><text start="8742.868" dur="1.832">a maximally talented future generation</text><text start="8744.7" dur="1.876">if the teachers are not the
maximally talented people?</text><text start="8746.576" dur="0.997">- [Zubin] Right.
- [Daniel] And so,</text><text start="8747.573" dur="1.59">how do you make an economic
system that does that?</text><text start="8749.163" dur="0.965">- [Zubin] Yeah, how do you do that?</text><text start="8750.128" dur="1.239">- [Daniel] Well, in the face</text><text start="8751.367" dur="4.082">of the increasing technological
automation of so many jobs,</text><text start="8755.449" dur="2.026">and yet the increasing wealth</text><text start="8757.475" dur="1.334">that is produced by those things,</text><text start="8758.809" dur="2.358">can you start to create new
types of economic systems,</text><text start="8761.167" dur="2.84">and economic rewards to have
a higher percentage of people</text><text start="8764.007" dur="2.354">doing these types of
very, very high-touch,</text><text start="8766.361" dur="2.595">high-complexity things, and
getting more rewarded to do so?</text><text start="8768.956" dur="2.615">- [Zubin] Yeah, intuitive,
creative, holistic things</text><text start="8771.571" dur="2.154">that require a human intelligence.</text><text start="8773.725" dur="2.088">That&apos;s enabled by tech, right?</text><text start="8775.813" dur="2.493">So the tech actually can
help offload, you know,</text><text start="8778.306" dur="1.3">I don&apos;t know if it was
Kasparov who said it,</text><text start="8779.606" dur="1.862">but he said, you know,
that Big Blue, or whatever,</text><text start="8781.468" dur="1.816">it could beat any human alive,</text><text start="8783.284" dur="2.319">but you give me Big Blue as a tool,</text><text start="8785.603" dur="2.185">and I&apos;ll beat any human,
or any computer alive.</text><text start="8787.788" dur="0.833">- [Daniel] Right.
- [Zubin] Yeah,</text><text start="8788.621" dur="1.386">and I think that&apos;s true in medicine, too.</text><text start="8790.007" dur="1.64">We talk about AI replacing
doctors, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s-</text><text start="8791.647" dur="2.52">- [Daniel] Symbiotic intelligence between</text><text start="8794.167" dur="2.991">collective intelligences
of humans designed well</text><text start="8797.158" dur="2.235">with the augmented computational capacity.</text><text start="8799.393" dur="1.736">- [Zubin] Yeah, so the
mechanical intelligence</text><text start="8801.129" dur="0.889">that computers are very good at-</text><text start="8802.018" dur="1.368">- [Daniel] This is the
same as what the future</text><text start="8803.386" dur="2.541">of democratic type systems could be is</text><text start="8805.927" dur="2.612">you make something better
than the Fourth Estate,</text><text start="8808.539" dur="2.056">which is something that is Facebook-like,</text><text start="8810.595" dur="2.055">meaning it can curate all the information.</text><text start="8812.65" dur="2.383">It can do machine learning
kind of parsing on it,</text><text start="8815.033" dur="2.0">and customize newsfeeds,</text><text start="8818.246" dur="1.688">but where it is optimizing for things</text><text start="8819.934" dur="3.227">like the relevant,
comprehensive educatedness</text><text start="8823.161" dur="1.898">of a population for things.</text><text start="8825.059" dur="1.443">- [Zubin] Social cohesion, whatever.</text><text start="8826.502" dur="2.681">- [Daniel] And, but you know,</text><text start="8829.183" dur="3.178">the same types of generative AI,</text><text start="8832.361" dur="2.48">semantic generative AI,
like GPT-3 that can make</text><text start="8834.841" dur="2.081">an infinite amount of
super compelling deep fakes</text><text start="8836.922" dur="1.948">and fuck the epistemic commons more,</text><text start="8838.87" dur="4.164">can also parse, could
be developed to parse</text><text start="8843.034" dur="2.914">massive fields of text to
see what is the distribution</text><text start="8845.948" dur="2.211">of the values that everyone
has about a particular thing</text><text start="8848.159" dur="1.596">to take as design constraints,</text><text start="8849.755" dur="1.618">or try to come up with
a better proposition</text><text start="8851.373" dur="1.113">that would be less polarizing,</text><text start="8852.486" dur="2.107">and more unifying for
the whole population.</text><text start="8854.593" dur="2.318">- [Zubin] The opposite of
what algorithms do now.</text><text start="8856.911" dur="3.292">- [Daniel] And it&apos;s not that
it&apos;s replacing human choice.</text><text start="8860.203" dur="0.833">It&apos;s informing-</text><text start="8861.036" dur="0.913">- [Zubin] Informing human choice, exactly-</text><text start="8861.949" dur="2.017">- [Daniel] One way that you
get over the data singularity</text><text start="8863.966" dur="1.833">of that there&apos;s more data than
anyone can pay attention to</text><text start="8865.799" dur="1.62">is people don&apos;t actually need to make,</text><text start="8867.419" dur="1.702">they don&apos;t need all the
data to make a choice.</text><text start="8869.121" dur="0.833">They need the meaning,</text><text start="8869.954" dur="1.865">which is like a second, or
third derivative on the data,</text><text start="8871.819" dur="3.504">which can I have the AI
process a fuckton of data</text><text start="8875.323" dur="1.939">to be able to parse where
there&apos;s incorrect stuff,</text><text start="8877.262" dur="1.191">where there&apos;s high confidence stuff,</text><text start="8878.453" dur="2.702">and put it into the form
that is decision informing,</text><text start="8881.155" dur="2.403">and then what is relevant

actually keep up with?</text><text start="8885.501" dur="1.879">- [Zubin] And that is
actually the application</text><text start="8887.38" dur="1.504">of big data in medicine, too.</text><text start="8888.884" dur="1.603">We don&apos;t need, the data is too much.</text><text start="8890.487" dur="0.875">There&apos;s tons of data.</text><text start="8891.362" dur="0.833">You could have wearables.</text><text start="8892.195" dur="0.833">You could have all this other garbage.</text><text start="8893.028" dur="0.833">Doctors are terrified of that,</text><text start="8893.861" dur="1.572">because what the hell are
we gonna do with that data?</text><text start="8895.433" dur="2.117">What we need is to parse it down into bits</text><text start="8897.55" dur="3.13">that then we can find meaning,
and use our intuition,</text><text start="8900.68" dur="4.572">which is, that&apos;s why we do
10,000 hours of training, right,</text><text start="8905.252" dur="4.583">is because that becomes an
unconscious intuitive thing.</text><text start="8911.707" dur="3.318">And only humans right now
have the inductive ability</text><text start="8915.025" dur="1.403">really to do that,</text><text start="8916.428" dur="2.119">and I actually had Federico

you could argue with,</text><text start="8935.622" dur="1.814">but it was really, you know,</text><text start="8937.436" dur="2.375">this idea that humans do

of other places we could go.</text><text start="9133.16" dur="2.411">I&apos;m curious to hear what is interesting,</text><text start="9135.571" dur="2.127">what people have questions on,</text><text start="9137.698" dur="2.434">disagree with from this piece.</text><text start="9140.132" dur="0.833">And...</text><text start="9143.437" dur="0.833">And I...</text><text start="9146.402" dur="4.78">Yeah, I love the fact that
you&apos;re publicly educating</text><text start="9151.182" dur="2.577">and learning publicly
simultaneously, right,</text><text start="9153.759" dur="3.889">and a medical expert who
is actually learning,</text><text start="9157.648" dur="3.442">updating their position,
and trying to orient people</text><text start="9161.09" dur="1.573">towards synthesis of something</text><text start="9162.663" dur="2.917">that is otherwise culture-breaking.</text><text start="9167.94" dur="2.336">And (laughs) I really
wanna see you do that thing</text><text start="9170.276" dur="2.608">where you get the experts in the,</text><text start="9172.884" dur="2.828">because it needs to happen.</text><text start="9175.712" dur="1.514">- [Zubin] You&apos;re very kind,
we&apos;re gonna try to do that.</text><text start="9177.226" dur="2.517">I have to say this, Daniel,
you are one of the people</text><text start="9179.743" dur="3.771">that I can consistently look at online</text><text start="9183.514" dur="2.095">in your resources to try to learn from,</text><text start="9185.609" dur="2.131">and you&apos;ve been instrumental
in my own understanding</text><text start="9187.74" dur="1.795">of these sort of
civilization-level threats,</text><text start="9189.535" dur="2.49">and how to even apply them down
to my own field of medicine,</text><text start="9192.025" dur="1.222">but even beyond that.</text><text start="9193.247" dur="2.406">So I&apos;m looking forward to
continuing the dialogue.</text><text start="9195.653" dur="3.893">I&apos;d love to get, you
know, Tristan and Zak-</text><text start="9199.546" dur="0.833">- [Daniel] Yeah.
- [Zubin] On the show,</text><text start="9200.379" dur="1.843">and talk to them about these
things, too, because again-</text><text start="9202.222" dur="0.837">- [Daniel] I&apos;ll send you intros.</text><text start="9203.059" dur="0.833">- [Zubin] Oh, that&apos;d be awesome,</text><text start="9203.892" dur="3.515">and where can we find you online?</text><text start="9207.407" dur="0.833">- [Daniel] There&apos;s a project that</text><text start="9208.24" dur="1.045">we started a little while ago.</text><text start="9209.285" dur="1.341">It&apos;s still in beta phase,</text><text start="9210.626" dur="1.305">and we have some super interesting things</text><text start="9211.931" dur="2.43">we&apos;ll be doing with it in this next year.</text><text start="9214.361" dur="2.85">It&apos;s called The Consilience
Project, consilienceproject.org,</text><text start="9217.211" dur="2.167">and I have a personal blog</text><text start="9220.5" dur="2.156">that mostly just has a list of podcasts up</text><text start="9222.656" dur="2.124">at civilizationemerging.com.</text><text start="9224.78" dur="1.489">- [Zubin] Okay, great, I&apos;ll
put both those links in,</text><text start="9226.269" dur="2.537">and yeah, those interviews
are fantastic, man.</text><text start="9228.806" dur="2.883">I think you did like a four-hour
thing with Lex Fridman.</text><text start="9231.689" dur="1.421">Man, I tell you, next time,</text><text start="9233.11" dur="1.618">we&apos;re gonna do six hours just to beat Lex-</text><text start="9234.728" dur="1.803">- [Daniel] He spent the
first half hour on UFOs,</text><text start="9236.531" dur="1.221">which I didn&apos;t expect
we were gonna go there,</text><text start="9237.752" dur="1.15">but yeah, Lex is cool.</text><text start="9238.902" dur="2.962">- [Zubin] I heard that,
I remember thinking,</text><text start="9241.864" dur="2.295">&quot;You actually know more
about UFOs than you should.&quot;</text><text start="9244.159" dur="3.944">Like where did you even learn about that?</text><text start="9248.103" dur="0.833">- [Daniel] Well, I mean, just think about</text><text start="9248.936" dur="1.477">what a consequential topic it is</text><text start="9250.413" dur="1.93">depending upon what is true.
- [Zubin] The most.</text><text start="9252.343" dur="4.989">- [Daniel] So I think anything
that is hard epistemically</text><text start="9257.332" dur="2.557">to figure out if it&apos;s true or
not, but super consequential,</text><text start="9259.889" dur="1.55">and differentially consequential one way,</text><text start="9261.439" dur="2.303">or the other is just
innately really interesting.</text><text start="9263.742" dur="0.959">- [Zubin] Yeah, there you go.</text><text start="9264.701" dur="2.679">Well, see, that&apos;s what I love
about you is your (laughs),</text><text start="9267.38" dur="2.354">your curiosity drives you
to go from first principles</text><text start="9269.734" dur="2.876">to establish really interesting
thought patterns on stuff,</text><text start="9272.61" dur="1.877">and you&apos;re really a unique guy.</text><text start="9274.487" dur="0.833">Thank you.</text><text start="9275.32" dur="1.112">Guys, you know what to do.</text><text start="9276.432" dur="0.866">Share the show.</text><text start="9277.298" dur="1.18">If you really like what we do,</text><text start="9278.478" dur="1.709">I was talking about Locals earlier.</text><text start="9280.187" dur="2.667">I&apos;m gonna pitch it one more
time, zdoggmd.locals.com,</text><text start="9282.854" dur="1.437">and you can join us there for free,</text><text start="9284.291" dur="1.864">or become a supporter for
like five bucks a month,</text><text start="9286.155" dur="2.332">and then we have this little
internal tribal dialogue</text><text start="9288.487" dur="2.846">that&apos;s looking for consilience, synthesis,</text><text start="9291.333" dur="1.623">alt-middle, integral, all the things,</text><text start="9292.956" dur="2.038">post-cynical thought, so thank you.</text><text start="9294.994" dur="0.833">- [Daniel] I haven&apos;t been there yet.</text><text start="9295.827" dur="1.402">I&apos;ve heard about it, I&apos;ll
come find you on Locals.</text><text start="9297.229" dur="0.871">- [Zubin] Find me and-
- [Daniel] Be a supporter.</text><text start="9298.1" dur="2.555">- [Zubin] And then poke
holes in all the problems</text><text start="9300.655" dur="1.011">with Locals, &apos;cause I know</text><text start="9301.666" dur="1.066">you&apos;ll find &apos;em.
(Zubin laughs)</text><text start="9302.732" dur="1.43">- [Daniel] Cool, thank you, Zubin-</text><text start="9304.162" dur="0.975">- [Zubin] All right, brother, take care.</text></transcript>
