obviously there investing in a</text><text start="137.099" dur="3.921">long-term climate change resilience</text><text start="138.78" dur="5.52">strategy</text><text start="141.02" dur="5.02">oh yeah well that would be a full</text><text start="144.3" dur="5.04">episode on itself</text><text start="146.04" dur="6.12">um the the medium term models show this</text><text start="149.34" dur="6.6">Minnesota Wisconsin area that I&apos;m I live</text><text start="152.16" dur="6.48">in not too bad but you know that that&apos;s</text><text start="155.94" dur="7.079">a huge huge topic</text><text start="158.64" dur="7.56">um so my friend we have arrived at</text><text start="163.019" dur="6.901">um what I expect will be the conclusion</text><text start="166.2" dur="6.3">of our series that we initially titled</text><text start="169.92" dur="6.539">Bend versus break</text><text start="172.5" dur="6.959">based on the logic that we have unpacked</text><text start="176.459" dur="6.42">these last four episodes</text><text start="179.459" dur="6.0">between humans how we use energy</text><text start="182.879" dur="4.14">materials and monetary markers to create</text><text start="185.459" dur="4.801">technology</text><text start="187.019" dur="6.36">and there is an embedded exponential</text><text start="190.26" dur="7.259">growth in our current system combining</text><text start="193.379" dur="6.421">these things that is heading us towards</text><text start="197.519" dur="4.681">an inflection point</text><text start="199.8" dur="5.46">the inflection point is if we are able</text><text start="202.2" dur="5.22">to continue to grow that has a bigger</text><text start="205.26" dur="5.46">environmental impacts more material</text><text start="207.42" dur="6.84">energy use CO2 and other things if we&apos;re</text><text start="210.72" dur="6.72">not able to continue to grow there is a</text><text start="214.26" dur="4.619">Wiley Coyote biophysical moment that we</text><text start="217.44" dur="4.14">have to prepare for</text><text start="218.879" dur="4.741">and your work with consilience project</text><text start="221.58" dur="4.2">and my work with the Great</text><text start="223.62" dur="4.14">simplification and The Institute for the</text><text start="225.78" dur="5.879">study of energy in our future</text><text start="227.76" dur="7.199">are to uh change the initial conditions</text><text start="231.659" dur="6.901">of these future moments uh and kind of</text><text start="234.959" dur="6.36">Meet the future halfway so that we bend</text><text start="238.56" dur="6.06">the civilization trajectory instead of</text><text start="241.319" dur="6.541">break and break would be bad</text><text start="244.62" dur="6.479">um so I think we&apos;ve uh you know done a</text><text start="247.86" dur="6.54">horizontal and vertical treatment of the</text><text start="251.099" dur="6.661">risks and the um the drivers and the</text><text start="254.4" dur="5.28">generator functions of humans for</text><text start="257.76" dur="5.939">thousands of years arriving at this</text><text start="259.68" dur="8.4">point at the end of the last episode uh</text><text start="263.699" dur="7.641">you preferred a three by three grid on</text><text start="268.08" dur="6.72">how uh we could think about</text><text start="271.34" dur="7.12">responses interventions mitigations what</text><text start="274.8" dur="6.2">to do and it was superstructure social</text><text start="278.46" dur="7.44">structure infrastructure</text><text start="281.0" dur="7.06">and triage transition and long term and</text><text start="285.9" dur="5.6">this podcast we&apos;re gonna we&apos;re gonna</text><text start="288.06" dur="5.46">unpack that first of all if I say</text><text start="291.5" dur="3.88">superstructure social structure</text><text start="293.52" dur="5.22">infrastructure we&apos;re going to have the</text><text start="295.38" dur="5.039">word structure in like 270 sentences is</text><text start="298.74" dur="4.32">there shorthand for those three that we</text><text start="300.419" dur="6.72">could use</text><text start="303.06" dur="5.82">yeah so those terms uh come originally</text><text start="307.139" dur="5.521">as far as I know from Marvin Harris&apos;s</text><text start="308.88" dur="6.66">work in uh the what&apos;s called cultural</text><text start="312.66" dur="5.039">materialism and but that draws from</text><text start="315.54" dur="4.2">previous work of uh Marx and other</text><text start="317.699" dur="6.541">people superstructure basically means</text><text start="319.74" dur="7.26">culture means the uh ordinating values</text><text start="324.24" dur="5.04">the identity the</text><text start="327.0" dur="4.08">um Aesthetics ethics axiology that a</text><text start="329.28" dur="4.02">civilization is oriented towards so</text><text start="331.08" dur="4.86">we&apos;ll just say culture it&apos;s simplifying</text><text start="333.3" dur="5.7">but we gotta just social structure</text><text start="335.94" dur="5.88">basically means the codified processes</text><text start="339.0" dur="4.979">by which agreement across the population</text><text start="341.82" dur="3.9">occurs so this is both this is a</text><text start="343.979" dur="3.361">political economy basically gov the</text><text start="345.72" dur="4.199">intersection of Economics governance and</text><text start="347.34" dur="4.919">the institutions that mediated Judicial</text><text start="349.919" dur="4.201">System law the scientific institutions</text><text start="352.259" dur="3.601">that are needed et cetera so we&apos;ll just</text><text start="354.12" dur="5.16">call that political economy</text><text start="355.86" dur="6.14">and then infrastructure means the</text><text start="359.28" dur="5.94">totality of the physical technical stack</text><text start="362.0" dur="4.78">that the civilization uses to support</text><text start="365.22" dur="6.3">itself and meet all of its physical</text><text start="366.78" dur="6.72">needs that&apos;s uh energy transportation</text><text start="371.52" dur="5.64">manufacturing materials Waste Management</text><text start="373.5" dur="5.46">blah blah all those things food water so</text><text start="377.16" dur="3.0">we&apos;ll call that Tech</text><text start="378.96" dur="2.94">um so by Tech here we don&apos;t mean</text><text start="380.16" dur="4.56">software social media we mean the</text><text start="381.9" dur="4.139">totality of the human technology and</text><text start="384.72" dur="2.759">sometimes we use the term infrastructure</text><text start="386.039" dur="4.561">because it&apos;s common but if we just say</text><text start="387.479" dur="6.121">technology political economy and culture</text><text start="390.6" dur="4.98">that roughly maps to this thing now we</text><text start="393.6" dur="3.599">already did this thing in episode two or</text><text start="395.58" dur="5.339">four or whatever it was so people can</text><text start="397.199" dur="7.741">have that reference and yeah I&apos;m very</text><text start="400.919" dur="5.34">happy to have arrived at the uh point in</text><text start="404.94" dur="4.62">the podcast that many people have been</text><text start="406.259" dur="5.821">looking for where they&apos;re asking so what</text><text start="409.56" dur="4.259">are solutions uh and we will get to</text><text start="412.08" dur="3.42">share some things that are hopefully</text><text start="413.819" dur="3.181">inspiring while simultaneously probably</text><text start="415.5" dur="2.759">disappointing people that we&apos;re not</text><text start="417.0" dur="3.18">going to offer something that looks like</text><text start="418.259" dur="3.481">one easily tractable simple thing that</text><text start="420.18" dur="3.48">they can go do something about that</text><text start="421.74" dur="4.019">solves everything</text><text start="423.66" dur="4.08">um but something I wanted to say is just</text><text start="425.759" dur="4.201">in recap</text><text start="427.74" dur="3.36">this episode will really be much more</text><text start="429.96" dur="2.16">useful if people have watched the</text><text start="431.1" dur="2.219">previous four</text><text start="432.12" dur="2.16">um if you&apos;ve got the time to watch this</text><text start="433.319" dur="1.981">one</text><text start="434.28" dur="3.78">and you haven&apos;t watched the previous</text><text start="435.3" dur="6.06">ones I would encourage that number one</text><text start="438.06" dur="4.68">we largely unpack uh a core of Nate&apos;s</text><text start="441.36" dur="3.779">work regarding the relationship between</text><text start="442.74" dur="3.92">energy the environment the materials</text><text start="445.139" dur="5.4">economy and finance</text><text start="446.66" dur="6.34">and uh really a fundamentally critical</text><text start="450.539" dur="5.16">thing to understand what break will mean</text><text start="453.0" dur="5.099">and what bin requires Bend not break is</text><text start="455.699" dur="4.081">of a safe term you have used uh for a</text><text start="458.099" dur="3.6">long time and then we&apos;re kind of going</text><text start="459.78" dur="5.819">back and forth on models here</text><text start="461.699" dur="6.301">number two and number four are unpacking</text><text start="465.599" dur="3.841">additional frames for what we call the</text><text start="468.0" dur="3.539">meta crisis and we had a little break</text><text start="469.44" dur="3.199">with number three where unintentionally</text><text start="471.539" dur="3.901">we ended up talking about</text><text start="472.639" dur="4.9">psychologically how do we hold being</text><text start="475.44" dur="3.659">aware of the intersection of all the</text><text start="477.539" dur="4.56">possible catastrophic risks and having</text><text start="479.099" dur="4.741">any sense of human agency and uh so</text><text start="482.099" dur="3.361">there&apos;s like a psychological interlude</text><text start="483.84" dur="4.62">number three</text><text start="485.46" dur="5.04">and so given that we have framed the</text><text start="488.46" dur="3.9">problem set in a particular way we&apos;ll be</text><text start="490.5" dur="3.66">talking about Solutions in light of that</text><text start="492.36" dur="3.0">where someone doesn&apos;t have that framing</text><text start="494.16" dur="2.34">some of what we&apos;re talking about will</text><text start="495.36" dur="3.239">seem like it doesn&apos;t make that much</text><text start="496.5" dur="4.259">sense I&apos;m just offering that as preface</text><text start="498.599" dur="5.761">for everybody</text><text start="500.759" dur="7.801">excellent uh and those will make</text><text start="504.36" dur="6.48">available and I&apos;d like to have Lizzy uh</text><text start="508.56" dur="5.159">the podcast curator maybe do a summary</text><text start="510.84" dur="6.059">of of all five of these in one place</text><text start="513.719" dur="6.24">so at the risk of delaying the punch</text><text start="516.899" dur="5.341">line even further I do have a couple</text><text start="519.959" dur="4.08">other things to add</text><text start="522.24" dur="4.34">um when we talk about this three by</text><text start="524.039" dur="6.061">three grid uh culture political economy</text><text start="526.58" dur="6.759">Tech stack and then short-term</text><text start="530.1" dur="7.08">intermediate term long term it also is</text><text start="533.339" dur="6.481">relevant uh to other frames number one</text><text start="537.18" dur="5.279">what do people care about there may be</text><text start="539.82" dur="6.3">people listening who just want to</text><text start="542.459" dur="5.701">protect themselves and their family to</text><text start="546.12" dur="4.26">what&apos;s coming there may be other people</text><text start="548.16" dur="5.16">that deeply care about dolphins and</text><text start="550.38" dur="4.74">citations and other species there may be</text><text start="553.32" dur="5.579">people listening that work for</text><text start="555.12" dur="6.56">governments or institutions</text><text start="558.899" dur="7.141">um and I think what someone cares about</text><text start="561.68" dur="7.42">is relevant to what we should do number</text><text start="566.04" dur="4.919">one number two is there&apos;s the the scale</text><text start="569.1" dur="4.62">of</text><text start="570.959" dur="5.161">World Government national government</text><text start="573.72" dur="5.16">local Regional</text><text start="576.12" dur="5.76">Community neighborhood individual family</text><text start="578.88" dur="5.16">and I think the what to do in your three</text><text start="581.88" dur="3.84">by three grid will be different for</text><text start="584.04" dur="3.479">those different scales so I don&apos;t know</text><text start="585.72" dur="3.84">how we want to treat that in this</text><text start="587.519" dur="4.38">conversation</text><text start="589.56" dur="4.62">yeah I mean all there&apos;s a lot of things</text><text start="591.899" dur="4.56">that need done right there&apos;s</text><text start="594.18" dur="3.9">a lot of things that are not in eminent</text><text start="596.459" dur="3.38">catastrophic risk but that are</text><text start="598.08" dur="4.86">maintaining the</text><text start="599.839" dur="6.041">not the quality of life for existing</text><text start="602.94" dur="4.68">life and also maintaining things that</text><text start="605.88" dur="2.88">would become a catastrophic risk to at</text><text start="607.62" dur="4.62">least that local area if they weren&apos;t</text><text start="608.76" dur="4.92">attended we want the nurses and the</text><text start="612.24" dur="2.82">people that work at the animal shelter</text><text start="613.68" dur="4.08">and the police officers and the</text><text start="615.06" dur="4.92">firefighters and the Educators to</text><text start="617.76" dur="4.44">actually become increasingly passionate</text><text start="619.98" dur="3.96">about what they do even though what</text><text start="622.2" dur="3.36">they&apos;re doing isn&apos;t at the scale of how</text><text start="623.94" dur="4.26">does it solve all of climate change or</text><text start="625.56" dur="5.1">AI risk or nuclear risk</text><text start="628.2" dur="3.96">um the idea that people would in the</text><text start="630.66" dur="2.82">face of those things become less</text><text start="632.16" dur="2.76">passionate about the thing they&apos;re doing</text><text start="633.48" dur="4.52">would just start the Cascade of</text><text start="634.92" dur="7.74">everything getting worse faster and so</text><text start="638.0" dur="6.82">if what you have in the scope of agency</text><text start="642.66" dur="4.02">that you can do something about is not</text><text start="644.82" dur="4.079">the totality of the meta crisis but it</text><text start="646.68" dur="3.659">is something real your connection to</text><text start="648.899" dur="2.641">something real and paying attention to</text><text start="650.339" dur="3.901">and focusing on the part you can do</text><text start="651.54" dur="4.739">something about recognizing that the</text><text start="654.24" dur="4.92">meta crisis is caused by the activity of</text><text start="656.279" dur="4.441">all all people cumulatively it also has</text><text start="659.16" dur="2.64">to be addressed by the activity of lots</text><text start="660.72" dur="3.48">of people</text><text start="661.8" dur="4.02">um yeah that&apos;s very important I want to</text><text start="664.2" dur="3.78">make sure that we say and we mentioned</text><text start="665.82" dur="4.019">this in number three that we want</text><text start="667.98" dur="3.66">these conversations to help</text><text start="669.839" dur="4.201">contextualize where you are in the world</text><text start="671.64" dur="4.74">help you think about how to do a more</text><text start="674.04" dur="4.799">effective job even at a local scale or</text><text start="676.38" dur="5.579">even in a narrow vertical</text><text start="678.839" dur="5.161">um but ultimately to enhance your sense</text><text start="681.959" dur="5.281">of the meaningfulness of everybody&apos;s</text><text start="684.0" dur="6.06">actions rather than otherwise</text><text start="687.24" dur="5.64">the brief aside from what you just said</text><text start="690.06" dur="4.86">you mentioned people working at animal</text><text start="692.88" dur="4.139">shelters every week my girlfriend and I</text><text start="694.92" dur="4.859">buy five Powerball tickets and we&apos;ve</text><text start="697.019" dur="5.581">agreed if we win we&apos;re giving all the 10</text><text start="699.779" dur="5.3">percent of the money to animal shelters</text><text start="702.6" dur="5.4">to protect dogs especially</text><text start="705.079" dur="4.661">that are also going to go through the</text><text start="708.0" dur="3.24">great simplification</text><text start="709.74" dur="4.74">um you know there&apos;s</text><text start="711.24" dur="6.0">100 million dogs uh Etc</text><text start="714.48" dur="5.46">um in this country so uh that&apos;s</text><text start="717.24" dur="5.039">something I think about a lot uh but</text><text start="719.94" dur="3.6">that&apos;s just a tiny tiny thing out of</text><text start="722.279" dur="4.441">everything that we&apos;re going to discuss</text><text start="723.54" dur="5.76">so so let&apos;s get into it so we we know</text><text start="726.72" dur="4.739">the problem set roughly uh and the</text><text start="729.3" dur="3.84">problem set is huge and goes beyond what</text><text start="731.459" dur="4.681">we&apos;ve discussed we didn&apos;t talk much</text><text start="733.14" dur="5.22">about climate or insect loss or some of</text><text start="736.14" dur="4.199">these things we know the problem set</text><text start="738.36" dur="4.14">we&apos;ve got the framing the short-term</text><text start="740.339" dur="4.261">long-term uh intermediate term and the</text><text start="742.5" dur="6.24">different uh</text><text start="744.6" dur="6.96">um lenses so before we get into that how</text><text start="748.74" dur="4.74">does one even begin to think about what</text><text start="751.56" dur="4.98">to do like what would be the</text><text start="753.48" dur="5.4">intellectual uh structure for how to</text><text start="756.54" dur="4.56">think about this and what not to think</text><text start="758.88" dur="3.54">about maybe</text><text start="761.1" dur="2.64">um there&apos;s a few things I want to share</text><text start="762.42" dur="3.12">that</text><text start="763.74" dur="4.62">might seem like non-sequiturs but I</text><text start="765.54" dur="5.28">think they&apos;re valuable frames</text><text start="768.36" dur="5.279">one is uh</text><text start="770.82" dur="5.579">I remember a long time ago reading</text><text start="773.639" dur="4.981">books on leadership and psychology and</text><text start="776.399" dur="5.101">business and</text><text start="778.62" dur="4.14">um then looking at the psychology of</text><text start="781.5" dur="2.82">typology whether you&apos;re looking at</text><text start="782.76" dur="5.1">Myers-Briggs or other systems of</text><text start="784.32" dur="5.34">typology and it was clear how someone</text><text start="787.86" dur="3.9">had succeeded in a particular business</text><text start="789.66" dur="3.6">with a particular typology and then said</text><text start="791.76" dur="3.12">these are the principles of success that</text><text start="793.26" dur="2.819">would totally not apply to someone of a</text><text start="794.88" dur="3.42">different type in maybe a different</text><text start="796.079" dur="4.5">sector like Warren Buffett would not do</text><text start="798.3" dur="5.339">a good job at Steve Jobs&apos;s job or vice</text><text start="800.579" dur="4.801">versa and so if Steve read Warren</text><text start="803.639" dur="3.121">Buffett or rockefeller&apos;s principles on</text><text start="805.38" dur="2.94">how to be effective they just you&apos;d just</text><text start="806.76" dur="3.3">be like I have to give up like I have no</text><text start="808.32" dur="6.24">chance I&apos;m not an accountant mindset I&apos;m</text><text start="810.06" dur="7.26">and so what I&apos;m gonna share</text><text start="814.56" dur="4.26">uh the immediate application of that is</text><text start="817.32" dur="3.06">we have tens of thousands of people</text><text start="818.82" dur="3.48">listening to this that are going to have</text><text start="820.38" dur="4.56">wildly different temperaments and value</text><text start="822.3" dur="3.9">systems and and skill sets everything</text><text start="824.94" dur="3.24">else</text><text start="826.2" dur="3.78">so pay attention to of all the things</text><text start="828.18" dur="4.08">you hear anywhere the ones that feel</text><text start="829.98" dur="4.14">like they make sense to you and actually</text><text start="832.26" dur="3.3">Empower you pay more attention to those</text><text start="834.12" dur="2.7">because</text><text start="835.56" dur="3.36">um you know I might share principles</text><text start="836.82" dur="3.3">that have been useful to me that might</text><text start="838.92" dur="2.52">not be that useful to you you have</text><text start="840.12" dur="2.88">different Dharma different passions</text><text start="841.44" dur="4.199">different typology a different mind</text><text start="843.0" dur="5.519">things that Nate finds useful so take</text><text start="845.639" dur="4.621">these as hopeful offerings But</text><text start="848.519" dur="4.5">ultimately if they don&apos;t feel empowering</text><text start="850.26" dur="4.139">then leave them and find other things</text><text start="853.019" dur="3.241">um</text><text start="854.399" dur="3.361">hopefully though we can share some</text><text start="856.26" dur="4.139">things that can be adapted to any</text><text start="857.76" dur="4.579">typology that are general principles</text><text start="860.399" dur="4.62">that&apos;s one thing I wanted to say preface</text><text start="862.339" dur="5.62">the next thing I want to say actually</text><text start="865.019" dur="4.26">goes back to animal shelters</text><text start="867.959" dur="4.201">um</text><text start="869.279" dur="4.62">I I grew up</text><text start="872.16" dur="3.479">spending a lot of time working and</text><text start="873.899" dur="3.541">volunteering in animal shelters and then</text><text start="875.639" dur="4.021">animal rescues where there was animals</text><text start="877.44" dur="5.1">that come from circuses or you know</text><text start="879.66" dur="5.76">various places and</text><text start="882.54" dur="4.739">in homeless shelters and just you know</text><text start="885.42" dur="3.84">the I had parents that were into</text><text start="887.279" dur="3.961">activism and and taking us to be</text><text start="889.26" dur="4.1">socially engaged in</text><text start="891.24" dur="2.12">um</text><text start="893.839" dur="5.62">and so I grew up like just not being</text><text start="897.42" dur="4.02">able to walk by a dog that was in bad</text><text start="899.459" dur="3.601">shape or a cat that was in bad shape or</text><text start="901.44" dur="3.36">a person in the sidewalk it was in bad</text><text start="903.06" dur="3.719">shape and like feel like it was okay to</text><text start="904.8" dur="3.599">walk by and</text><text start="906.779" dur="3.06">it was actually that work that got me</text><text start="908.399" dur="2.701">into the macro systemic work because</text><text start="909.839" dur="2.401">working in the shelter and seeing how</text><text start="911.1" dur="3.239">many of the dogs were being put down</text><text start="912.24" dur="5.159">while people are still buying new bread</text><text start="914.339" dur="5.701">puppies and like then</text><text start="917.399" dur="4.321">feeling the great success of working my</text><text start="920.04" dur="3.299">ass off to get a couple dogs adopted but</text><text start="921.72" dur="2.82">then seeing the scale of it right and</text><text start="923.339" dur="3.12">then seeing that&apos;s just dogs right</text><text start="924.54" dur="4.2">that&apos;s not cows and factory farms I</text><text start="926.459" dur="5.221">started thinking at scale but motivated</text><text start="928.74" dur="3.92">by the high touch this dog right this</text><text start="931.68" dur="2.94">cow</text><text start="932.66" dur="3.94">there&apos;s a lot of people who think about</text><text start="934.62" dur="3.3">existential risk like the EA Community</text><text start="936.6" dur="2.76">or rationalist Community they think</text><text start="937.92" dur="3.659">about existential risk in a very</text><text start="939.36" dur="3.779">abstract way not having actually touched</text><text start="941.579" dur="4.56">this is an existential risk to this</text><text start="943.139" dur="4.681">person living in this refugee camp or in</text><text start="946.139" dur="4.32">this ghetto or this dog or this whatever</text><text start="947.82" dur="5.1">and</text><text start="950.459" dur="4.32">it&apos;s abstract it can be almost an</text><text start="952.92" dur="4.74">intellectual curiosity rather than an</text><text start="954.779" dur="5.401">expression of actually embodied care</text><text start="957.66" dur="4.32">and it can even be worse than that it</text><text start="960.18" dur="3.42">can be like</text><text start="961.98" dur="3.659">a topic that seems like it has power</text><text start="963.6" dur="4.08">associated</text><text start="965.639" dur="4.38">and so</text><text start="967.68" dur="4.68">if someone</text><text start="970.019" dur="5.94">can walk by the people on the street and</text><text start="972.36" dur="5.219">not notice that much and if they aren&apos;t</text><text start="975.959" dur="4.021">actively bothered by the situation</text><text start="977.579" dur="4.2">animals are in I don&apos;t trust those</text><text start="979.98" dur="4.219">people to be thinking about catastrophic</text><text start="981.779" dur="2.42">risk</text><text start="984.54" dur="3.78">um</text><text start="985.279" dur="4.781">I only want like I only really want to</text><text start="988.32" dur="3.18">trust people thinking about meta</text><text start="990.06" dur="3.24">systemic stuff who actually ground it</text><text start="991.5" dur="4.019">because otherwise you can you can say</text><text start="993.3" dur="4.44">well long-termism in the future this</text><text start="995.519" dur="4.38">many trillions of people might die if we</text><text start="997.74" dur="3.839">don&apos;t such and such therefore we should</text><text start="999.899" dur="3.3">do these things now and these things now</text><text start="1001.579" dur="3.781">might cause lots of harm but it&apos;s a good</text><text start="1003.199" dur="4.621">expected value calculus utilitarian</text><text start="1005.36" dur="3.779">calculus long term and it&apos;s like or you</text><text start="1007.82" dur="2.699">know we have to do this war but here&apos;s</text><text start="1009.139" dur="3.361">the benefit and we&apos;ll try to minimize</text><text start="1010.519" dur="4.201">collateral damage it&apos;s like minimize</text><text start="1012.5" dur="4.199">collateral damage means how many moms</text><text start="1014.72" dur="3.78">are watching broken babies and that are</text><text start="1016.699" dur="3.681">civilians and bomb buildings it&apos;s like</text><text start="1018.5" dur="5.279">don&apos;t call it collateral damage don&apos;t</text><text start="1020.38" dur="5.98">sanitize it like so</text><text start="1023.779" dur="4.8">but the people who are high touch and</text><text start="1026.36" dur="3.959">who can&apos;t walk by a person what does</text><text start="1028.579" dur="3.6">high touch mean I haven&apos;t heard that</text><text start="1030.319" dur="4.201">word before</text><text start="1032.179" dur="4.02">rather than high abstraction or thinking</text><text start="1034.52" dur="3.419">about the high-tech that a high</text><text start="1036.199" dur="4.62">orientation to</text><text start="1037.939" dur="5.281">the actual touch right like working with</text><text start="1040.819" dur="5.88">this animal like you know how much time</text><text start="1043.22" dur="6.3">you&apos;ll spend rehabilitating one dog</text><text start="1046.699" dur="4.441">or one animal that&apos;s covered in oil one</text><text start="1049.52" dur="3.72">seagull and you&apos;re like [ __ ] this is a</text><text start="1051.14" dur="3.84">lot of time right but it&apos;s totally worth</text><text start="1053.24" dur="3.24">it when you&apos;re with that one and then</text><text start="1054.98" dur="3.12">you think about scale</text><text start="1056.48" dur="4.26">and</text><text start="1058.1" dur="4.56">if you don&apos;t move to scale obviously you</text><text start="1060.74" dur="3.78">can&apos;t address the issues at scale for</text><text start="1062.66" dur="3.78">most people that&apos;s fine like doing the</text><text start="1064.52" dur="4.38">high touch thing is fine if you feel</text><text start="1066.44" dur="6.599">like you can think systemically you</text><text start="1068.9" dur="5.46">can&apos;t lose the high touchness otherwise</text><text start="1073.039" dur="4.801">um</text><text start="1074.36" dur="4.819">the abstraction can make</text><text start="1077.84" dur="4.32">you</text><text start="1079.179" dur="4.781">disconnected enough to do evil in the</text><text start="1082.16" dur="3.6">name of moral things</text><text start="1083.96" dur="4.02">and</text><text start="1085.76" dur="4.919">that&apos;s a challenge but here&apos;s the other</text><text start="1087.98" dur="4.699">challenge that this uh Harkens back to</text><text start="1090.679" dur="6.841">our video number three</text><text start="1092.679" dur="7.661">is the more High touch you are</text><text start="1097.52" dur="4.92">given world events the more likely</text><text start="1100.34" dur="4.26">you&apos;re going to be overwhelmed in in</text><text start="1102.44" dur="3.54">what&apos;s going on and not be able to do</text><text start="1104.6" dur="3.9">things at scale because it&apos;s too</text><text start="1105.98" dur="4.62">overwhelming so you can be high</text><text start="1108.5" dur="4.679">abstraction and try to do things at</text><text start="1110.6" dur="5.1">scale but then you&apos;re not connected in</text><text start="1113.179" dur="4.441">the way that you&apos;re just describing</text><text start="1115.7" dur="3.3">yeah so</text><text start="1117.62" dur="3.299">if you really</text><text start="1119.0" dur="4.679">if your heart is open and you feel and</text><text start="1120.919" dur="5.461">you see what I&apos;m in New York City right</text><text start="1123.679" dur="4.981">now it&apos;s not where I live and it&apos;s cold</text><text start="1126.38" dur="4.5">this time of year and it&apos;s a [ __ ]</text><text start="1128.66" dur="4.56">terrible place to be homeless and cold</text><text start="1130.88" dur="4.2">and if you let yourself feel that now</text><text start="1133.22" dur="4.199">it&apos;s just in Istanbul and there were</text><text start="1135.08" dur="3.66">four million Syrian refugees there and</text><text start="1137.419" dur="3.781">there were</text><text start="1138.74" dur="3.6">you know they didn&apos;t speak the language</text><text start="1141.2" dur="2.7">and we don&apos;t speak the language</text><text start="1142.34" dur="4.26">necessarily of other places we might</text><text start="1143.9" dur="4.139">have to flee I saw a kid who I was</text><text start="1146.6" dur="2.819">talking to whose parents were both</text><text start="1148.039" dur="2.64">killed in the war he wasn&apos;t asking for</text><text start="1149.419" dur="3.061">anything he was just hiding because he</text><text start="1150.679" dur="3.36">said if he gets anything everybody well</text><text start="1152.48" dur="4.88">is violent towards him to take his stuff</text><text start="1154.039" dur="3.321">and it was like</text><text start="1158.24" dur="6.48">if you let yourself feel that it&apos;s easy</text><text start="1161.0" dur="5.1">to just feel completely broken right and</text><text start="1164.72" dur="4.26">um</text><text start="1166.1" dur="4.14">and and or get completely pulled into I</text><text start="1168.98" dur="4.14">just need to be at this refugee camp</text><text start="1170.24" dur="4.799">working here and not think about can I</text><text start="1173.12" dur="5.16">do something at scale</text><text start="1175.039" dur="5.341">this spiritual psychological work to</text><text start="1178.28" dur="4.68">feel the depth of those feelings and</text><text start="1180.38" dur="4.74">transmute it into more devotion and more</text><text start="1182.96" dur="3.24">agency and more strength to be able to</text><text start="1185.12" dur="3.66">serve</text><text start="1186.2" dur="4.859">and keep that high touch and figure out</text><text start="1188.78" dur="4.56">how to do strategy effectively</text><text start="1191.059" dur="5.521">is the only way forward I know</text><text start="1193.34" dur="7.14">that well it&apos;s liable I hope you don&apos;t</text><text start="1196.58" dur="6.959">mind me sharing this publicly but</text><text start="1200.48" dur="6.12">in our private conversations I have not</text><text start="1203.539" dur="4.981">criticized you but observed that that&apos;s</text><text start="1206.6" dur="5.34">one of the reasons you are not being</text><text start="1208.52" dur="5.76">more effective globally is because you</text><text start="1211.94" dur="3.599">can&apos;t say no to helping people I know so</text><text start="1214.28" dur="3.06">many examples where someone is</text><text start="1215.539" dur="4.201">struggling with something and you&apos;re</text><text start="1217.34" dur="4.02">giving them time and advice and there&apos;s</text><text start="1219.74" dur="6.0">just only a certain number of hours in</text><text start="1221.36" dur="7.14">the day so you&apos;re high touch uh is you</text><text start="1225.74" dur="5.46">know a little bit of a lodestone to</text><text start="1228.5" dur="4.5">really being effective but let&apos;s let&apos;s</text><text start="1231.2" dur="3.18">just go forward with that I think I</text><text start="1233.0" dur="4.94">understand your point</text><text start="1234.38" dur="3.56">the thing there is</text><text start="1238.82" dur="5.28">I struggle with it and there&apos;s so many</text><text start="1241.22" dur="4.38">places where I don&apos;t say yes to helping</text><text start="1244.1" dur="3.78">someone that I really wish I could</text><text start="1245.6" dur="4.079">because it would be saying no to work on</text><text start="1247.88" dur="3.72">projects that I really</text><text start="1249.679" dur="5.221">hope can change things at scale and</text><text start="1251.6" dur="6.3">believe can for a lot of people</text><text start="1254.9" dur="4.2">but it&apos;s never easy for me to say no</text><text start="1257.9" dur="2.7">where I really could make a difference</text><text start="1259.1" dur="3.36">and I don&apos;t want it to be easy for</text><text start="1260.6" dur="3.12">anybody like I struggle with it and I</text><text start="1262.46" dur="3.36">might make wrong choices but I would</text><text start="1263.72" dur="4.14">like anyone to struggle with it</text><text start="1265.82" dur="3.719">right as opposed to just turn something</text><text start="1267.86" dur="4.08">off where then it&apos;s easy</text><text start="1269.539" dur="4.14">I would not like people there&apos;s the</text><text start="1271.94" dur="3.06">dialectic of things to wrestle with I</text><text start="1273.679" dur="2.821">want someone to always be in the</text><text start="1275.0" dur="4.26">wrestling with</text><text start="1276.5" dur="4.679">and it&apos;s interesting because someone can</text><text start="1279.26" dur="5.159">say like hey this thing is not as</text><text start="1281.179" dur="5.101">important because of scale but the</text><text start="1284.419" dur="4.441">person who can Harden themselves to the</text><text start="1286.28" dur="4.68">people around them will think wrongly</text><text start="1288.86" dur="3.66">and then do it wrongly about how to make</text><text start="1290.96" dur="4.92">a good world at scale</text><text start="1292.52" dur="4.98">I trust them less I trust more the</text><text start="1295.88" dur="3.659">person who feels the people around them</text><text start="1297.5" dur="5.28">enough that they have to do something</text><text start="1299.539" dur="5.041">they feel compelled to and so this is</text><text start="1302.78" dur="3.6">where utilitarian

this</text><text start="1346.46" dur="3.42">first on the show is and that&apos;s why I</text><text start="1348.62" dur="3.48">was happy that you brought up the animal</text><text start="1349.88"

feel</text><text start="1356.0" dur="3.6">about it right you have to</text><text start="1358.159" dur="2.781">like when we talk about the meta crisis</text><text start="1359.6" dur="5.22">we&apos;re

come up</text><text start="1452.9" dur="5.46">with some very Innovative strategies to</text><text start="1455.179" dur="6.181">be able to protect life more effectively</text><text start="1458.36"

dur="4.819">very empirical very tangible maximally</text><text start="1470.84" dur="5.76">High consequence type real situation</text><text start="1473.679" dur="4.061">and the thing that they said and

that</text><text start="1512.72" dur="3.66">I already know do I get a fit on this</text><text start="1514.4" dur="4.86">what they were training the guys to do</text><text start="1516.38" dur="4.5">is to be able to not think that their</text><text start="1519.26" dur="3.48">existing solution might be adequate so</text><text start="1520.88" dur="3.72">they could truly innovate to start by</text><text start="1522.74" dur="3.78">saying how do I assess the novelty of</text><text start="1524.6" dur="5.34">what&apos;s going on without letting my</text><text start="1526.52" dur="4.98">existing salience Frameworks limit me</text><text start="1529.94" dur="3.06">and that that was the core of</text><text start="1531.5" dur="4.32">empirically what actually has been</text><text start="1533.0" dur="4.32">making them more effective</text><text start="1535.82" dur="6.359">so uh</text><text start="1537.32" dur="7.8">frequent periodic personal ooh of the</text><text start="1542.179" dur="5.1">ooda loops in an individual&apos;s way of</text><text start="1545.12" dur="4.32">looking at the world</text><text start="1547.279" dur="4.621">observe

dur="3.779">decide and act without</text><text start="1555.58" dur="3.94">understanding the observe Orient well</text><text start="1557.779" dur="3.841">enough and then oftentimes they have</text><text start="1559.52" dur="4.62">Frameworks like the answer is and they</text><text start="1561.62" dur="3.6">know what the answer is so then of</text><text start="1564.14" dur="3.12">course they have a hammer and they&apos;re</text><text start="1565.22" dur="4.439">looking for nails but it means that</text><text start="1567.26" dur="4.26">their observation is actually deadened</text><text start="1569.659" dur="3.421">because they have existing solution</text><text start="1571.52" dur="2.94">Frameworks they&apos;re trying to apply so</text><text start="1573.08" dur="2.94">they&apos;re trying to look for which of my</text><text start="1574.46" dur="3.54">existing solution framework supplies or</text><text start="1576.02" dur="3.659">where can I apply this

was them looking for Solutions</text><text start="1599.539" dur="4.561">too quickly rather than being able to</text><text start="1601.94" dur="4.08">drop that and really actually assess the</text><text start="1604.1" dur="5.9">novelty of this situation</text><text start="1606.02" dur="3.98">so I just want to offer that first</text><text start="1610.279" dur="5.581">um because I do find that the impulse to</text><text start="1614.0" dur="4.14">jump straight to solution is an</text><text start="1615.86" dur="5.52">uncomfort with uncertainty</text><text start="1618.14" dur="5.1">that doesn&apos;t want to actually not know</text><text start="1621.38" dur="3.48">what to do and feel like there&apos;s</text><text start="1623.24" dur="3.419">consequential stuff but that makes it</text><text start="1624.86" dur="5.22">more likely you do the wrong thing</text><text start="1626.659" dur="4.801">and it&apos;s more important to just</text><text start="1630.08" dur="3.719">be able to chill the [ __ ] out enough</text><text start="1631.46" dur="4.199">that you can actually observe the real</text><text start="1633.799" dur="4.081">novel situation and come up

start="1645.98" dur="5.4">I want to share</text><text start="1647.24" dur="6.6">I like it it can be taken too far I&apos;ve</text><text start="1651.38" dur="4.98">been chilling the [ __ ] out and

dur="4.74">that&apos;s kind of my job but I I totally</text><text start="1662.539" dur="3.961">agree with you I think there and this</text><text start="1664.22" dur="5.579">ties into people&apos;s

start="1685.1" dur="3.9">um obviously if someone has a fiscal</text><text start="1687.2" dur="3.24">incentive to externalize the cost they</text><text start="1689.0" dur="2.88">will blah blah but it&apos;s not just a</text><text start="1690.44" dur="3.18">perverse incentive in the traditional</text><text start="1691.88" dur="4.98">economic sense it&apos;s</text><text start="1693.62" dur="5.1">if my job is measured in certain metrics</text><text start="1696.86" dur="4.38">even if it&apos;s not a perverse fiscal</text><text start="1698.72" dur="4.319">incentive for me but I&apos;m whatever I&apos;m</text><text start="1701.24" dur="4.799">some un Department focused on world food</text><text start="1703.039" dur="5.461">program focused on feeding kids or a</text><text

dur="5.28">those are the metrics that I&apos;m tasked</text><text start="1724.82" dur="6.42">with and so there I think of that as a</text><text start="1728.6" dur="4.62">institutional Choice

it&apos;s not just perverse incentive</text><text start="1736.46" dur="5.28">equals greed it&apos;s also that we can</text><text start="1738.32" dur="5.88">divide the world up into this is

dur="2.82">just these few metrics and I can arm</text><text start="1747.44" dur="2.82">other things that are still</text><text start="1748.82" dur="4.14">interconnected</text><text start="1750.26"

dur="4.921">is there a mandate that I have that is</text><text start="1768.62" dur="4.98">too narrow to think well to strategize</text><text start="1771.2" dur="4.14">well is because when you were saying</text><text start="1773.6" dur="3.84">earlier some people care about narrow</text><text start="1775.34" dur="3.24">things well it&apos;s very likely that things</text><text start="1777.44"

dur="5.96">you should have a soil scientist who is</text><text start="1975.26" dur="6.24">continuously</text><text start="1976.84" dur="7.18">learning more about how to effectively</text><text

you relate</text><text start="2013.059" dur="2.521">in network you know with everyone else</text><text start="2014.559" dur="2.941">and there will be some people who are</text><text start="2015.58"

those</text><text start="2067.72" dur="5.159">typologies have to switch into maybe a</text><text start="2071.02" dur="3.54">different objective or parallel</text><text start="2072.879" dur="3.72">objective</text><text start="2074.56" dur="4.859">yeah I mean we talked about this in</text><text start="2076.599" dur="4.82">number two I think is that</text><text start="2079.419" dur="2.0">um</text><text start="2081.879" dur="5.341">money equals optionality to do lots of</text><text start="2084.099" dur="5.04">things so money is a decentralized</text><text start="2087.22" dur="4.02">incentive system to incentivize people</text><text start="2089.139" dur="4.441">to figure out how to get better at</text><text start="2091.24" dur="4.439">making it and which means novelty search</text><text start="2093.58" dur="3.539">and optimization do a better job of</text><text start="2095.679" dur="2.101">whatever you already figured out how to</text><text start="2097.119" dur="2.101">do</text><text start="2097.78" dur="3.96">and</text><text start="2099.22" dur="4.5">obviously you can make money via</text><text start="2101.74" dur="4.56">production but also extraction you can</text><text start="2103.72" dur="5.04">make money via value adding but also</text><text start="2106.3" dur="4.14">externalization of cost and</text><text start="2108.76" dur="4.079">um so when we&apos;re talking about</text><text start="2110.44" dur="4.38">organizing towards these other purposes</text><text start="2112.839" dur="3.661">right towards a fundamentally different</text><text

motivating you still you will</text><text start="2121.3" dur="3.9">need to be in coordination with other</text><text start="2123.4" dur="4.56">people who are similarly motivated to</text><text start="2125.2" dur="5.04">you but have different capacities</text><text start="2127.96" dur="4.379">now can we come back to externalities</text><text start="2130.24" dur="5.64">how to avoid externalities</text><text start="2132.339" dur="5.221">okay this this is</text><text start="2135.88" dur="4.199">um</text><text start="2137.56" dur="3.779">I think there&apos;s a couple topics that I</text><text start="2140.079" dur="6.54">want to mention before we get into the</text><text start="2141.339" dur="7.381">three by three so one is how to avoid</text><text start="2146.619" dur="3.48">externalities causing or causing other</text><text start="2148.72" dur="3.48">problems in the process of trying to</text><text start="2150.099" dur="3.841">solve a problem the other is how to</text><text start="2152.2" dur="3.06">avoid feeling that the thing that you&apos;re</text><text start="2153.94" dur="4.8">doing is important enough that you have</text><text start="2155.26" dur="5.94">enough passion over it that you don&apos;t</text><text start="2158.74" dur="4.08">under emphasize how important many other</text><text start="2161.2" dur="3.659">things are</text><text start="2162.82" dur="4.38">um and both of these speak to a kind of</text><text start="2164.859" dur="3.961">holisticness of consideration so first</text><text start="2167.2" dur="3.419">on externality</text><text start="2168.82" dur="3.96">I&apos;m not going to give the examples of</text><text start="2170.619" dur="3.72">how trying to solve one problem causes</text><text start="2172.78" dur="3.78">others because we did that already in</text><text start="2174.339" dur="4.141">the conversation so go listen to it but</text><text start="2176.56" dur="4.26">it is almost everything</text><text start="2178.48" dur="4.74">um it&apos;s so easy to say we can bring</text><text start="2180.82" dur="4.08">electricity to these people by burning</text><text start="2183.22" dur="3.6">more coal or making a hydroelectric Dam</text><text start="2184.9" dur="4.679">that will extinct all these species in</text><text start="2186.82" dur="4.5">this area on the river or blah blah blah</text><text start="2189.579" dur="3.661">whatever it is now I&apos;m not going to say</text><text start="2191.32" dur="3.48">there is no such thing as trade-offs it</text><text start="2193.24" dur="3.66">is a childish view to pretend there are</text><text start="2194.8" dur="3.96">no trade-offs what I&apos;m saying is if you</text><text start="2196.9" dur="3.24">don&apos;t care about all the things if you</text><text start="2198.76" dur="2.819">haven&apos;t monitored all the things that</text><text start="2200.14" dur="4.02">are involved and care about them all you</text><text start="2201.579" dur="4.801">will make unnecessarily bad trade-offs</text><text start="2204.16" dur="3.48">and then the process you will also</text><text start="2206.38" dur="3.239">polarize the people that care about</text><text start="2207.64" dur="3.66">those things so of course it is mature</text><text start="2209.619" dur="3.361">to realize there will be some trade-offs</text><text start="2211.3" dur="3.12">but at least consciously look at and</text><text start="2212.98" dur="3.3">care about all of them and come up with</text><text start="2214.42" dur="3.72">the best synergistic satisfier as you</text><text start="2216.28" dur="4.5">can the thing that serves all the things</text><text start="2218.14" dur="5.34">that matter as best as possible</text><text start="2220.78" dur="3.6">so on the topic of externalities how do</text><text start="2223.48" dur="2.4">you</text><text start="2224.38" dur="4.5">uh</text><text start="2225.88" dur="4.739">how do you think through</text><text start="2228.88" dur="4.68">actually I just wrote up a list of</text><text start="2230.619" dur="4.261">questions that I think help people think</text><text start="2233.56" dur="3.0">through how to understand the problem</text><text start="2234.88" dur="3.959">space and how to understand a solution</text><text start="2236.56" dur="3.9">space I&apos;ll send it to you as a document</text><text start="2238.839" dur="4.621">so you can include it in the show notes</text><text start="2240.46" dur="4.86">for this before we get the externalities</text><text start="2243.46" dur="4.2">it asks questions like if you&apos;re looking</text><text start="2245.32" dur="4.62">at a problem whether it&apos;s Health Care in</text><text start="2247.66" dur="4.08">my town or you know too many isrogenic</text><text start="2249.94" dur="4.26">deaths at my hospital or why there are</text><text start="2251.74" dur="4.98">so many uh</text><text start="2254.2" dur="3.6">so much soil erosion in this area or so</text><text start="2256.72" dur="2.58">much government corruption or whatever</text><text start="2257.8" dur="3.66">it is</text><text start="2259.3" dur="4.559">um in the assessment there are questions</text><text start="2261.46" dur="3.72">that are universally relevant like where</text><text start="2263.859" dur="3.361">in this system are there perverse</text><text start="2265.18" dur="4.26">incentives just see if we start to map</text><text start="2267.22" dur="5.04">where anyone has a financial incentive</text><text start="2269.44" dur="5.34">or a status incentive or uh cover your</text><text start="2272.26" dur="3.9">ass incentive that is not aligned with</text><text start="2274.78" dur="3.54">doing the maximally good things of the</text><text start="2276.16" dur="3.36">whole and honesty just by starting to</text><text start="2278.32" dur="3.299">notice that</text><text start="2279.52" dur="3.9">and not in a partisan way right in the</text><text start="2281.619" dur="3.72">bipartisan all directions way you&apos;ll</text><text start="2283.42" dur="3.54">start to be like oh well of course this</text><text start="2285.339" dur="3.961">thing isn&apos;t going well because there are</text><text start="2286.96" dur="3.32">these perverse incentives</text><text start="2289.3" dur="5.12">um</text><text start="2290.28" dur="7.48">the biggest perverse incentive of all is</text><text start="2294.42" dur="7.96">profits as our cultural goal which means</text><text start="2297.76" dur="7.859">I can buy this iPhone for 400 500 but if</text><text start="2302.38" dur="5.52">you included the external costs</text><text start="2305.619" dur="3.48">it would be five thousand dollars and a</text><text start="2307.9" dur="3.24">lot more people wouldn&apos;t be able to</text><text start="2309.099" dur="5.48">afford it</text><text start="2311.14" dur="3.439">so the fact that</text><text start="2315.339" dur="6.361">the externalization of cost to the</text><text start="2319.18" dur="4.38">environment and poor people is what</text><text start="2321.7" dur="3.48">allows the market to exist and that if</text><text start="2323.56" dur="3.299">we actually had to do the accounting and</text><text start="2325.18" dur="3.36">pay all of the costs so that we weren&apos;t</text><text start="2326.859" dur="3.48">stealing from anyone&apos;s balance sheet</text><text start="2328.54" dur="3.9">that the market wouldn&apos;t exist</text><text start="2330.339" dur="3.621">and that</text><text start="2332.44" dur="3.899">um</text><text start="2333.96" dur="4.48">would look radically different I&apos;m not</text><text start="2336.339" dur="3.961">sure it wouldn&apos;t exist but go on</text><text start="2338.44" dur="4.38">it wouldn&apos;t exist as it does right like</text><text start="2340.3" dur="3.6">it not any area as they exist currently</text><text start="2342.82" dur="2.46">would be profitable everything would</text><text start="2343.9" dur="3.3">have to get restructured in some very</text><text start="2345.28" dur="2.76">deep ways</text><text start="2347.2" dur="3.12">um</text><text start="2348.04" dur="4.74">I think any anyone who&apos;s ever become a</text><text start="2350.32" dur="4.5">like Artisan craft person and made stuff</text><text start="2352.78" dur="4.559">and then thinks about how cheap Factory</text><text start="2354.82" dur="4.14">stuff is like God damn how like shut</text><text start="2357.339" dur="3.181">stuff should not be that cheap like it</text><text start="2358.96" dur="3.119">should we should have much less things</text><text start="2360.52" dur="3.3">that are much more expensive and much</text><text start="2362.079" dur="3.421">more oriented to reuse and durability</text><text start="2363.82" dur="4.5">and</text><text start="2365.5" dur="4.32">um so yes that is one of the very deep</text><text start="2368.32" dur="3.24">perverse incentives but that means for</text><text start="2369.82" dur="4.32">any particular problem you&apos;re looking at</text><text start="2371.56" dur="4.019">look at within your area where there are</text><text start="2374.14" dur="3.42">fiscal perverse incentives that</text><text start="2375.579" dur="3.78">particularly go against the problem</text><text start="2377.56" dur="3.299">you&apos;re trying to solve because those are</text><text start="2379.359" dur="4.081">that&apos;s where the opposition is going to</text><text start="2380.859" dur="3.661">come and then you can start to think</text><text start="2383.44" dur="3.36">through</text><text start="2384.52" dur="5.04">can we use law to bind this can we use</text><text start="2386.8" dur="4.559">Collective value system in a cultural</text><text start="2389.56" dur="3.6">forcing function to bind this can we use</text><text start="2391.359" dur="3.961">a different profit motive and make them</text><text start="2393.16" dur="3.84">a healthier profit motive where people</text><text start="2395.32" dur="4.019">are willing to pay for a more expensive</text><text start="2397.0" dur="4.56">thing because it&apos;s better you know</text><text start="2399.339" dur="4.5">um so being able to say the humans that</text><text start="2401.56" dur="4.019">are doing the thing have some</text><text start="2403.839" dur="3.661">motivators can we look at the human</text><text start="2405.579" dur="3.121">motivators across the system and align</text><text start="2407.5" dur="2.82">them with the thing we&apos;re trying to do</text><text start="2408.7" dur="3.12">better that&apos;s just a question that it&apos;s</text><text start="2410.32" dur="3.48">very good for people to get good at</text><text start="2411.82" dur="4.5">thinking through</text><text start="2413.8" dur="3.72">another one is someone is thinking about</text><text start="2416.32" dur="2.759">a problem</text><text start="2417.52" dur="4.62">and you think through what are all the</text><text start="2419.079" dur="5.28">problems Upstream from this problem</text><text start="2422.14" dur="3.66">so they contribute to it let&apos;s say we&apos;re</text><text start="2424.359" dur="3.781">dealing with a</text><text start="2425.8" dur="4.68">factory farm issue well people&apos;s value</text><text start="2428.14" dur="4.56">systems and not caring about animals</text><text start="2430.48" dur="3.54">enough is one language and sanitizing</text><text start="2432.7" dur="5.04">and calling it</text><text start="2434.02" dur="5.579">beef or pork rather than cows or animals</text><text start="2437.74" dur="3.54">the invisibility is part of the problem</text><text start="2439.599" dur="2.341">putting it far away where nobody can see</text><text start="2441.28" dur="2.46">it</text><text start="2441.94" dur="2.94">as opposed to having taxi interact with</text><text start="2443.74" dur="2.82">it&apos;s part of the problem the financial</text><text start="2444.88" dur="5.219">incentives are part of the problem that</text><text start="2446.56" dur="4.98">and so if your solution whatever the</text><text start="2450.099" dur="2.821">solution is there&apos;s one thing but it</text><text start="2451.54" dur="2.88">doesn&apos;t

right</text><text start="3291.72" dur="4.32">um</text><text start="3292.74" dur="5.76">and then there is also an incentive to</text><text start="3296.04" dur="5.039">care about these things which is</text><text start="3298.5" dur="4.98">non-extinction is a good incentive</text><text start="3301.079" dur="5.641">like just even from a personal extrinsic</text><text start="3303.48"

dur="2.54">you pay attention</text><text start="3329.88" dur="3.0">okay</text><text start="3334.619" dur="4.081">okay so we were saying Upstream</text><text start="3336.54" dur="3.42">Downstream

dur="4.161">completely well knowing they never can</text><text start="3363.24" dur="4.079">your best externality analysis will</text><text start="3365.76" dur="2.94">still miss [ __ ] that

of broad listening and</text><text start="3375.059" dur="2.581">watching after you do it to see what</text><text start="3376.559" dur="3.421">might be being affected that you</text><text start="3377.64" dur="4.74">wouldn&apos;t have even expected</text><text start="3379.98" dur="3.119">and</text><text start="3382.38" dur="3.5">um</text><text start="3383.099" dur="5.581">did we expect when smartphones came out</text><text start="3385.88" dur="4.959">that they would have the effect on</text><text start="3388.68" dur="4.919">dinner tables or human attention in</text><text

those things so and we might have</text><text start="3398.579" dur="3.061">anticipated some to anticipate all the</text><text start="3400.319" dur="4.201">things you can</text><text start="3401.64" dur="5.1">but also maybe even in the visual human</text><text start="3404.52" dur="3.96">focal length of focusing on 2D things at</text><text start="3406.74" dur="4.74">a fixed focal length so much of

dur="3.9">that does</text><text start="3414.26" dur="6.04">neuropsychologically so what I would say</text><text start="3416.94" dur="6.419">is you have to do the best job</text><text start="3420.3" dur="5.16">of anticipating externalities you can</text><text start="3423.359" dur="3.96">while recognizing there will be ones you</text><text start="3425.46" dur="4.2">didn&apos;t anticipate so you want some very</text><text start="3427.319" dur="4.621">broad diffuse listening to say after we</text><text start="3429.66" dur="3.959">started this thing what&apos;s what new</text><text start="3431.94" dur="2.94">things started to occur that might have</text><text start="3433.619" dur="2.7">been connected</text><text start="3434.88" dur="3.9">are you kind of talking about

specifically</text><text start="3441.9" dur="4.38">how to think about applying it right</text><text start="3444.42" dur="3.54">and</text><text start="3446.28" dur="3.839">so we&apos;re talking about a holistic</text><text start="3447.96" dur="4.74">principle and a precautionary principle</text><text start="3450.119" dur="3.841">but we&apos;re trying to formalize it as like</text><text start="3452.7" dur="4.44">a way that people can think about</text><text start="3453.96" dur="4.8">applying this thing so first how do you</text><text start="3457.14" dur="4.62">think through the externalities on</text><text start="3458.76" dur="5.22">second third fourth order effects</text><text start="3461.76" dur="5.04">by talking to more people with different</text><text start="3463.98" dur="5.579">perspectives about the thing</text><text start="3466.8" dur="4.2">as the first really key part this is</text><text start="3469.559" dur="3.601">where diversity of perspective and</text><text start="3471.0" dur="5.099">pluralism is really a real thing</text><text start="3473.16" dur="4.98">if I&apos;m thinking okay I&apos;m going to solve</text><text start="3476.099"

sounds good</text><text start="3488.94" dur="4.44">go talk to the indigenous people about</text><text start="3491.4" dur="3.659">the solution and they&apos;ll be like</text><text start="3493.38" dur="2.939">no no there are some other groups that</text><text start="3495.059" dur="3.78">did things like that and here&apos;s what</text><text start="3496.319" dur="4.441">happens the the they just hire</text><text start="3498.839" dur="3.541">mercenaries to do this thing or it gets</text><text start="3500.76" dur="3.299">worse for this reason or whatever and</text><text start="3502.38" dur="3.84">you&apos;re like oh [ __ ] I didn&apos;t know that</text><text start="3504.059" dur="3.06">and go talk to the legal Scholars and</text><text start="3506.22" dur="2.339">they&apos;re like oh there&apos;s no way to</text><text start="3507.119" dur="3.061">implement this in law because of such</text><text start="3508.559" dur="3.841">and such and go talk to the economists</text><text start="3510.18" dur="3.54">who are like law is written by lobbyists</text><text start="3512.4" dur="2.28">and they have more money to keep writing</text><text start="3513.72" dur="2.639">law than you do you&apos;re going to lose</text><text start="3514.68" dur="3.78">this one and go</text><text start="3516.359" dur="3.061">um you go talk to the environmental</text><text start="3518.46" dur="2.399">scientist and they&apos;ll be like actually</text><text start="3519.42" dur="2.939">you&apos;re protecting the wrong part of the</text><text start="3520.859" dur="4.74">forest it&apos;s not even high biodiversity</text><text start="3522.359" dur="6.841">here relative to this area and</text><text start="3525.599" dur="5.46">so there&apos;s a lot of people who will know</text><text start="3529.2" dur="4.5">stuff that you don&apos;t know</text><text start="3531.059" dur="5.04">and they won&apos;t be able to see where some</text><text start="3533.7" dur="4.2">of the externalities will occur</text><text start="3536.099" dur="3.661">including people that are on the</text><text start="3537.9" dur="3.6">opposite political side of the thing</text><text start="3539.76" dur="2.94">right whoever would fight against it</text><text start="3541.5" dur="2.579">there&apos;s something that they care about</text><text start="3542.7" dur="2.76">that is real even if they&apos;re wrong about</text><text start="3544.079" dur="4.141">some stuff they&apos;re not wrong about 100</text><text start="3545.46" dur="4.32">of everything so finding out why do they</text><text start="3548.22" dur="3.78">not like it and say how can I factor</text><text start="3549.78" dur="3.779">that in so one I can not cause the</text><text start="3552.0" dur="3.42">problems for them and as a result</text><text start="3553.559" dur="3.361">decrease their enmity and maybe get them</text><text start="3555.42" dur="3.6">as allies rather than fighting the thing</text><text start="3556.92" dur="3.78">right you&apos;ll become more successful and</text><text start="3559.02" dur="3.059">it&apos;ll be a better solution</text><text start="3560.7" dur="3.0">so the way to Think Through</text><text start="3562.079" dur="3.601">externalities better is when you come up</text><text start="3563.7" dur="3.419">with a possible solution talk to lots of</text><text start="3565.68" dur="3.119">people about what might be wrong with it</text><text start="3567.119" dur="4.021">so red team it</text><text start="3568.799" dur="4.141">but then don&apos;t give up say ask them okay</text><text start="3571.14" dur="3.419">how would you make it better to still</text><text start="3572.94" dur="3.54">serve the thing I&apos;m wanting to serve but</text><text start="3574.559" dur="5.101">to improve the thing that you&apos;re seeing</text><text start="3576.48" dur="6.599">and so you use it as a proposition or</text><text start="3579.66" dur="5.82">design refinement process</text><text start="3583.079" dur="4.74">and so that&apos;s the first part and then</text><text start="3585.48" dur="4.68">the second part is once you implement it</text><text start="3587.819" dur="4.321">try to implement it in experimental ways</text><text start="3590.16" dur="3.3">right you have some safe to fail probes</text><text start="3592.14" dur="2.699">you don&apos;t implement the largest thing</text><text start="3593.46" dur="2.52">possible okay I think we figured out</text><text start="3594.839" dur="3.72">that this</text><text start="3595.98" dur="4.2">this version of AI or this genetically</text><text start="3598.559" dur="3.481">modified organism is safe let&apos;s just</text><text start="3600.18" dur="4.32">[ __ ] take it

that now I</text><text start="3818.28" dur="4.62">think everybody is at least somewhat</text><text start="3819.54" dur="5.22">aware but that the supply chains that</text><text start="3822.9" dur="4.38">make anything happen</text><text start="3824.76" dur="4.079">have lots of effects that&apos;s physical</text><text start="3827.28" dur="6.12">externalities</text><text start="3828.839" dur="7.081">just like a a point on that is the</text><text start="3833.4" dur="5.34">physical benefits we get in terms of</text><text start="3835.92" dur="5.76">profits or services</text><text start="3838.74" dur="4.619">um aren&apos;t on equal footing with the</text><text start="3841.68" dur="4.139">negative externalities that Rachel</text><text start="3843.359" dur="4.561">Carson warned about and and others</text><text start="3845.819" dur="4.5">because those things happen in the</text><text start="3847.92" dur="4.56">future and we&apos;re a biological species so</text><text start="3850.319" dur="4.02">emotionally they have and culturally</text><text start="3852.48" dur="2.819">they have very little weight in our</text><text start="3854.339" dur="3.181">brains</text><text start="3855.299" dur="4.621">so that&apos;s why this stuff has happened</text><text start="3857.52" dur="4.92">because our capitalist exponential</text><text start="3859.92" dur="4.74">system has backloaded some of those</text><text start="3862.44" dur="4.2">costs that are second third order</text><text start="3864.66" dur="3.78">effects from our decisions and our</text><text start="3866.64" dur="3.78">products</text><text start="3868.44" dur="4.44">right I&apos;d actually like to explain a few</text><text start="3870.42" dur="3.84">reasons why it happened so one is a lot</text><text start="3872.88" dur="3.3">of the harms will occur in the future</text><text start="3874.26" dur="5.819">but the benefits occur now and so there</text><text start="3876.18" dur="5.879">is a a perverse

start="3883.5" dur="3.78">probably wins</text><text start="3885.78" dur="3.18">having more power to influence the</text><text start="3887.28" dur="2.7">overall system and those who don&apos;t do</text><text start="3888.96" dur="2.52">the thing that will cause the future</text><text start="3889.98" dur="3.0">harm also don&apos;t get the power and then</text><text start="3891.48" dur="3.96">don&apos;t influence the whole system so</text><text start="3892.98" dur="4.079">there&apos;s a perverse incentive not just a</text><text start="3895.44" dur="3.72">psychological bias there&apos;s also a game</text><text start="3897.059" dur="3.661">theoretic perverse incentive to do that</text><text start="3899.16" dur="3.659">thing</text><text start="3900.72" dur="4.76">um it&apos;s also true that as we were</text><text start="3902.819" dur="2.661">mentioning earlier</text><text start="3906.059" dur="3.5">making a tech that produces a certain</text><text start="3907.92"

start="3916.319" dur="4.561">creating a first order effect on a small</text><text start="3918.599" dur="5.22">number of metrics is just epistemically</text><text start="3920.88" dur="4.8">easier than

that</text><text start="4348.14" dur="3.48">intended audience and we don&apos;t Focus</text><text start="4349.76" dur="4.38">that much on how the people that will</text><text start="4351.62" dur="5.16">not agree with this respond</text><text start="4354.14" dur="4.98">and there are many reasons for this in</text><text start="4356.78" dur="4.14">the U.S which has such an outsized

dur="6.179">the nature of a bipartisan political</text><text start="4367.4" dur="5.64">situation and not having something like</text><text start="4369.679" dur="6.48">ranked Choice voting

understand</text><text start="4424.4" dur="4.92">and maybe do but who is not my intended</text><text start="4427.76" dur="3.0">audience and who&apos;s going to not like</text><text start="4429.32" dur="3.24">this message and what are they going to</text><text start="4430.76" dur="3.66">do and am I radicalizing them am I</text><text start="4432.56" dur="4.26">polarizing them am I making them feel</text><text start="4434.42" dur="3.6">like what they care about is going to be</text><text start="4436.82" dur="3.12">attacked where they&apos;re more likely to</text><text start="4438.02" dur="3.42">become terrorists and you know are more</text><text start="4439.94" dur="3.66">likely to whatever</text><text start="4441.44" dur="4.2">that&apos;s an effect that&apos;s an externality</text><text start="4443.6" dur="4.38">of my choice I might have made a choice</text><text start="4445.64" dur="4.2">that seemed like coalescing these people</text><text start="4447.98" dur="4.739">to do this thing was good but I actually</text><text start="4449.84" dur="5.7">just upregulated extremism or terrorism</text><text start="4452.719" dur="5.341">or total polarization in a critical</text><text start="4455.54" dur="5.1">audience and so</text><text start="4458.06" dur="5.46">um one very simple but this gets back to</text><text start="4460.64" dur="5.76">your example though that if you can get</text><text start="4463.52" dur="5.82">rich or elected from doing that and you</text><text start="4466.4" dur="4.799">have made extremes of your enemies who</text><text start="4469.34" dur="4.14">cares as long as you win is the current</text><text start="4471.199" dur="4.261">logic</text><text start="4473.48" dur="4.32">and so what I&apos;m saying is if your</text><text start="4475.46" dur="4.259">politician is doing that and you</text><text start="4477.8" dur="4.379">actually care about the world more</text><text start="4479.719" dur="4.081">largely they are the wrong they have the</text><text start="4482.179" dur="5.401">wrong logic that&apos;s not the thing to</text><text start="4483.8" dur="5.28">support and if you are working to do a</text><text start="4487.58" dur="3.599">non-profit thing or whatever and there&apos;s</text><text start="4489.08" dur="4.8">a media campaign involved don&apos;t do that</text><text start="4491.179" dur="4.321">thing so of course the world is where it</text><text start="4493.88" dur="3.359">is because</text><text start="4495.5" dur="3.12">the things we&apos;re talking about are not</text><text start="4497.239" dur="3.181">widely practiced understood or</text><text start="4498.62" dur="3.9">implemented there is a huge amount of</text><text start="4500.42" dur="3.42">political side</text><text start="4502.52" dur="3.42">correct</text><text start="4503.84" dur="5.28">and</text><text start="4505.94" dur="5.04">um but since you cannot actually kick</text><text start="4509.12" dur="5.52">the other half of the world off the</text><text start="4510.98" dur="6.06">planet and since they aren&apos;t just</text><text start="4514.64" dur="4.019">inert pieces of wood they do they are</text><text start="4517.04" dur="3.54">smart people with goals and values</text><text start="4518.659" dur="4.341">they&apos;re political actors and</text><text start="4520.58" dur="4.86">um if if they if what you say</text><text start="4523.0" dur="4.719">anti-resonates with them and they get up</text><text start="4525.44" dur="3.96">regulated to do a bunch of action so</text><text start="4527.719" dur="4.321">it&apos;s true that when you villainize</text><text start="4529.4" dur="3.96">somebody else you can coalesce a bunch</text><text start="4532.04" dur="3.48">of people against them and you can</text><text start="4533.36" dur="4.44">actually have moral people be willing to</text><text start="4535.52" dur="4.32">celebrate causing harm to others</text><text start="4537.8" dur="4.5">that&apos;s very effective politically it&apos;s</text><text start="4539.84" dur="4.5">it also happens to be evil</text><text start="4542.3" dur="4.379">um calling women witches allowed</text><text start="4544.34" dur="3.92">seemingly moral people to burn them to</text><text start="4546.679" dur="3.601">death right and calling somebody</text><text start="4548.26"

the burning witches era I</text><text start="4555.739" dur="5.101">I wish people understood like the the</text><text start="4558.86" dur="4.44">lynching was not long ago</text><text start="4560.84" dur="4.8">right the lynching as like a</text><text start="4563.3" dur="4.439">of entertainment was not long ago the</text><text start="4565.64" dur="3.36">burning Witch is the</text><text

that</text><text start="4572.54" dur="5.82">happening today so how quickly you know</text><text start="4575.239" dur="7.261">when you when you look at</text><text start="4578.36" dur="7.44">the pictures of women wearing mini</text><text start="4582.5" dur="5.699">skirts in 1968 neuron and you know then</text><text start="4585.8" dur="4.14">the the thing that happened in the</text><text start="4588.199" dur="4.381">Ayatollah and then the burkas when you</text><text start="4589.94" dur="5.279">look at how it well relatively Advanced</text><text start="4592.58" dur="4.26">Liberia was and then the internal war</text><text start="4595.219" dur="3.661">and then child soldiers were placing</text><text start="4596.84" dur="3.72">what had been a economically prosperous</text><text start="4598.88" dur="5.22">area when you look at Syria recently</text><text start="4600.56" dur="5.28">like if you when you look at Ukraine you</text><text start="4604.1" dur="3.54">can have an area that seems peaceful and</text><text start="4605.84" dur="4.74">economically prosperous Progressive and</text><text start="4607.64" dur="6.24">liberal and it collapses and turns into</text><text start="4610.58" dur="4.8">war violence extremism you know Etc it</text><text start="4613.88" dur="3.299">goes from any skirts to burcas to</text><text start="4615.38" dur="3.9">whatever and so</text><text start="4617.179" dur="3.48">those are canaries in a coal mine of</text><text start="4619.28" dur="2.939">something that is possible for anywhere</text><text start="4620.659"

start="4650.719" dur="4.921">they&apos;re sheeple or their libtards or</text><text start="4654.08" dur="5.159">whatever it is like both sides have</text><text start="4655.64" dur="6.84">their terms to

dur="5.94">of increasing enmity polarization Etc so</text><text start="4677.179" dur="4.98">this is a place where the externality is</text><text start="4680.54" dur="4.38">psychosocial so one thing I want to</text><text start="4682.159" dur="4.801">think about is who cares about this</text><text start="4684.92" dur="3.779">issue and then who cares about another</text><text start="4686.96" dur="3.239">issue that feels threatened by this</text><text start="4688.699" dur="3.241">that&apos;s in this area of trade-offs what</text><text start="4690.199" dur="4.681">do they care about how do I come up with</text><text start="4691.94" dur="5.219">a solution that could get more broad</text><text start="4694.88" dur="4.62">support and less enmity it&apos;s just a more</text><text start="4697.159" dur="3.781">effective strategy also unless I don&apos;t</text><text start="4699.5" dur="3.719">care that the thing I work real hard for</text><text start="4700.94" dur="3.779">gets undone in four years</text><text start="4703.219" dur="3.781">um but there are no groups of people</text><text start="4704.719" dur="5.46">that feel really good about being</text><text start="4707.0" dur="5.04">villainized and that will just sit</text><text start="4710.179" dur="4.321">comfortably and let the thing that</text><text start="4712.04" dur="4.02">villainize them continue to succeed</text><text start="4714.5" dur="3.36">so</text><text start="4716.06" dur="4.679">um that&apos;s one example of a psychosocial</text><text start="4717.86" dur="5.1">externality which is where

so</text><text start="4993.8" dur="5.58">one is how do you understand</text><text start="4996.739" dur="3.901">how to think about a solution in a way</text><text start="4999.38" dur="4.98">that will</text><text start="5000.64" dur="5.579">prevent unintended consequences</text><text start="5004.36" dur="3.96">um and that will be better set to to</text><text start="5006.219" dur="3.541">deal

get</text><text start="5013.06" dur="2.659">uh</text><text start="5015.88" dur="4.26">fundamentalist about their particular</text><text start="5017.679" dur="3.601">solution because if you&apos;re

dur="5.26">become overly narrowly focused so when I</text><text start="5027.52" dur="4.08">was first starting to try to wrap my</text><text start="5029.56" dur="4.679">head around like</text><text start="5031.6" dur="4.32">what is Upstream from all of these</text><text start="5034.239" dur="3.741">various problems or what are the</text><text start="5035.92" dur="4.38">underlying causes that

solution for civilization doing</text><text start="5047.8" dur="3.54">better look like</text><text start="5049.179" dur="3.781">I of course read the work of people and</text><text start="5051.34" dur="2.58">also had the fortune to talk to a lot of</text><text start="5052.96" dur="2.52">people that had spent their life</text><text start="5053.92" dur="2.819">thinking about these things and work on</text><text start="5055.48" dur="5.1">them</text><text start="5056.739" dur="6.181">and would ask their analysis and</text><text start="5060.58" dur="4.2">I got so many answers that sounded like</text><text start="5062.92" dur="4.68">this</text><text start="5064.78" dur="4.68">you know at</text><text start="5067.6" dur="3.78">the end of the day</text><text start="5069.46" dur="3.6">whenever somebody uses a phrase like</text><text start="5071.38" dur="4.38">that at the end of the day or the key is</text><text start="5073.06" dur="4.56">you can usually expect a reductionist</text><text start="5075.76" dur="3.66">thing to come next</text><text start="5077.62" dur="3.36">um not always but you like you know</text><text start="5079.42" dur="4.56">sometimes you want to pay attention to</text><text start="5080.98" dur="4.739">that at the end of the day</text><text start="5083.98" dur="3.36">uh</text><text start="5085.719" dur="3.721">uh really the thing we have to shift is</text><text start="5087.34" dur="3.3">the economy because perverse economic</text><text start="5089.44" dur="2.94">incentive is under the whole thing</text><text start="5090.64" dur="4.44">there&apos;s no way that as long as you have</text><text start="5092.38" dur="4.44">a for-profit military-industrial complex</text><text start="5095.08" dur="4.02">is the largest block of a

dur="3.601">there&apos;s so much money to be made with</text><text start="5102.4" dur="3.96">mining Etc like we have to fix the</text><text start="5104.32" dur="3.0">nature of economic incentives I&apos;d be</text><text start="5106.36" dur="2.339">nodding I&apos;m like this makes perfect</text><text start="5107.32" dur="2.58">sense right and somebody else would be</text><text start="5108.699" dur="3.661">like</text><text start="5109.9" dur="4.38">you know the core of the thing that we</text><text start="5112.36" dur="4.62">have to address is</text><text start="5114.28" dur="5.82">education because</text><text start="5116.98" dur="4.8">you can have so much change occur in a</text><text start="5120.1" dur="4.559">generation if those children are growing</text><text start="5121.78"

start="5130.719" dur="6.301">of screwed if you get education right</text><text start="5133.84" dur="5.28">we want adults who care about the</text><text start="5137.02" dur="3.42">animals and the oceans and the contend</text><text start="5139.12" dur="2.94">to all of these things and can think</text><text start="5140.44" dur="2.759">complexly if we really get education</text><text start="5142.06" dur="3.06">right we&apos;ll be able to solve everything</text><text start="5143.199" dur="3.781">it&apos;s Upstream from all that and like I&apos;m</text><text start="5145.12" dur="2.94">nodding I&apos;m like oh yeah this is it and</text><text start="5146.98" dur="2.759">then somebody else would be like oh</text><text start="5148.06" dur="4.38">really the thing is it&apos;s about media</text><text start="5149.739" dur="4.081">because we&apos;re continuously being</text><text start="5152.44" dur="2.88">bombarded and that was before social</text><text start="5153.82" dur="3.18">media then it was social media we&apos;re</text><text start="5155.32" dur="4.08">being continuously bombarded and we were</text><text start="5157.0" dur="4.26">ready to go do a capital Riot or a</text><text start="5159.4" dur="3.6">George Floyd protester Riot or whatever</text><text start="5161.26" dur="3.72">it is based on the stuff that&apos;s coming</text><text start="5163.0" dur="3.36">in if we could change the media</text><text start="5164.98" dur="3.719">environment of what people were in</text><text start="5166.36" dur="3.54">taking it would change all of these</text><text start="5168.699" dur="2.46">things and then someone else like no no</text><text start="5169.9" dur="4.319">the thing is really at the end of the</text><text start="5171.159" dur="4.381">day it&apos;s about government and law and</text><text start="5174.219" dur="3.661">how do we get that right because the</text><text start="5175.54" dur="4.199">economic incentive wouldn&apos;t be that same</text><text start="5177.88" dur="3.72">issue if we could govern it properly if</text><text start="5179.739" dur="4.081">we could force the internalization of</text><text start="5181.6" dur="4.38">the price of carbon and get carbon</text><text start="5183.82" dur="3.839">pricing properly and get cost of</text><text start="5185.98" dur="2.82">everything proper all that would be</text><text start="5187.659" dur="3.301">fixed but we have to do that through law</text><text start="5188.8" dur="3.899">so how do we fix governance and law and</text><text start="5190.96" dur="4.38">then somebody else will be like</text><text start="5192.699" dur="4.141">you can&apos;t because laws written by</text><text start="5195.34" dur="3.12">lobbyists that get paid for by somebody</text><text start="5196.84" dur="2.76">and wherever the economic motive is is</text><text start="5198.46" dur="2.96">what&apos;s going to pay for that which is</text><text start="5199.6" dur="3.72">why you you have to think about</text><text start="5201.42" dur="3.34">economics and a lot of the other so the</text><text start="5203.32" dur="4.14">key is political economy and how do you</text><text start="5204.76" dur="4.68">get that so and on and on people would</text><text start="5207.46" dur="3.48">say no really the key is actually</text><text start="5209.44" dur="2.94">parenting what we&apos;ve really got to do is</text><text start="5210.94" dur="3.36">restore the family because before</text><text start="5212.38" dur="3.839">education by the time that kid goes to</text><text start="5214.3" dur="3.359">school at five or six that so much of</text><text start="5216.219" dur="3.121">their identity and psyche and value</text><text start="5217.659" dur="3.781">system has already said it happens early</text><text start="5219.34" dur="3.78">on we have to actually change the entire</text><text start="5221.44" dur="3.779">culture to have parenting emphasize</text><text start="5223.12" dur="3.66">raising better kids from the beginning</text><text start="5225.219" dur="3.841">and what I came to learn is they were</text><text start="5226.78" dur="3.3">all right right somebody else would be</text><text start="5229.06" dur="2.7">everything you&apos;re saying is so</text><text start="5230.08" dur="3.3">anthropocentric the key is the [ __ ]</text><text start="5231.76" dur="2.879">environment because we&apos;re none of us are</text><text start="5233.38" dur="2.7">anything without the environment like</text><text start="5234.639" dur="3.241">you have to prioritize that everything</text><text start="5236.08" dur="4.32">else doesn&apos;t matter that much and like</text><text start="5237.88" dur="4.02">what is an economy like we can breathe</text><text start="5240.4" dur="2.4">without money we can&apos;t breathe without</text><text start="5241.9" dur="3.779">air</text><text start="5242.8" dur="4.02">and so be less anthropocentric and focus</text><text start="5245.679" dur="2.161">on the Integrity of the environment</text><text start="5246.82" dur="6.2">because that&apos;s Upstream from everything</text><text start="5247.84" dur="8.22">and so what I what I learned was</text><text start="5253.02" dur="5.38">the answer to all of the problems is all</text><text start="5256.06" dur="4.02">of the solutions</text><text start="5258.4" dur="3.299">um there is not a theory of chains</text><text start="5260.08" dur="3.3">there&apos;s an Ecology of theories of change</text><text start="5261.699" dur="2.881">it&apos;s so often when someone says what is</text><text start="5263.38" dur="4.98">the solution it sounds like someone&apos;s</text><text start="5264.58" dur="5.28">saying like what species is the forest</text><text start="5268.36" dur="4.26">like I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re even</text><text start="5269.86" dur="4.56">asking like a forest is lots of species</text><text start="5272.62" dur="3.3">lots and lots and if it&apos;s an old growth</text><text start="5274.42" dur="3.66">forest it&apos;s even more complexly</text><text start="5275.92" dur="3.84">interacting so what is the solution</text><text start="5278.08" dur="3.54">there&apos;s not a solution there&apos;s lots of</text><text start="5279.76" dur="4.14">things that need to happen so if</text><text start="5281.62" dur="4.14">anything I want patterns of how to think</text><text start="5283.9" dur="3.0">about it and I want Frameworks for how</text><text start="5285.76" dur="2.82">to think about it and I don&apos;t want</text><text start="5286.9" dur="2.819">people to attached to those Frameworks</text><text start="5288.58" dur="2.099">because they&apos;ll be useful but also</text><text start="5289.719" dur="4.801">limiting</text><text start="5290.679" dur="6.0">and to realize the cultural aspects do</text><text start="5294.52" dur="4.32">involve education and media and</text><text start="5296.679" dur="4.621">parenting</text><text start="5298.84" dur="5.399">religion and lots of other things and</text><text start="5301.3" dur="4.439">the structure of cities yeah you know in</text><text start="5304.239" dur="3.601">the political economy aspects involve</text><text start="5305.739" dur="3.061">lots of things and so and</text><text start="5307.84" dur="5.04">um</text><text start="5308.8" dur="6.18">the getting past the zealotists and</text><text start="5312.88" dur="4.98">reductionist focus and being able to get</text><text start="5314.98" dur="4.32">how do all these things come together</text><text start="5317.86" dur="5.299">is</text><text start="5319.3" dur="3.859">key to understanding properly</text><text start="5324.4" dur="4.98">I love that I got the systems ecology</text><text start="5327.4" dur="3.299">equivalent of Goosebumps as you were</text><text start="5329.38" dur="2.759">unpacking that</text><text start="5330.699" dur="4.321">um</text><text start="5332.139" dur="5.341">and that that&apos;s exactly right and but</text><text start="5335.02" dur="4.74">that&apos;s a lot for the</text><text start="5337.48" dur="5.46">that&apos;s a lot of complexity for most</text><text start="5339.76" dur="5.7">people to hold in their mind because</text><text start="5342.94" dur="5.94">they&apos;re they&apos;ve worked their whole life</text><text start="5345.46" dur="6.42">on climate and they think climate is the</text><text start="5348.88" dur="4.859">single uh problem and their identity is</text><text start="5351.88" dur="4.2">attached to it their job is attached to</text><text start="5353.739" dur="7.561">it so to say it&apos;s all these things</text><text start="5356.08" dur="8.24">governance and love and law and pricing</text><text start="5361.3" dur="6.0">and everything that you just mentioned</text><text start="5364.32" dur="7.72">how does someone shift from where they</text><text

dur="4.44">yeah the embedded growth obligation goes</text><text start="6016.739" dur="6.121">macro and micro right</text><text start="6019.02" dur="6.84">um but if you want to</text><text start="6022.86" dur="5.279">grow your own self and your own capacity</text><text start="6025.86" dur="4.859">to be in service of the world then you</text><text start="6028.139" dur="4.381">can&apos;t

to be actually</text><text start="6039.96" dur="4.02">doing good work you don&apos;t just want to</text><text start="6041.699" dur="4.741">be doing meditation and Psychotherapy</text><text

dur="4.08">the thing that will help the most is</text><text start="6082.199" dur="4.081">find mentors that are doing work that is</text><text start="6084.239" dur="3.661">most like the work you want to do and</text><text start="6086.28" dur="3.66">figure out what they need that you can</text><text start="6087.9" dur="4.68">become useful for</text><text start="6089.94" dur="4.98">this was the thing I&apos;m most grateful for</text><text start="6092.58" dur="3.84">in my own education was I had amazing</text><text start="6094.92" dur="4.319">mentors</text><text start="6096.42" dur="4.44">and I just figured out that they needed</text><text start="6099.239" dur="3.181">diapers changed or they needed</text><text start="6100.86" dur="3.359">construction or they needed whatever the</text><text start="6102.42" dur="3.0">hell it was and I just figured out how</text><text start="6104.219" dur="2.881">to learn how to do the things they</text><text start="6105.42" dur="4.38">needed so I could be around</text><text start="6107.1" dur="5.099">because you learned so much like you</text><text start="6109.8" dur="4.62">know if you get to go work with Nate</text><text start="6112.199" dur="5.281">and when he goes to DC and is talking</text><text start="6114.42" dur="5.219">with people about financial strategies</text><text start="6117.48" dur="4.02">for the energy Grid or things like that</text><text start="6119.639" dur="3.54">you&apos;ll learn a lot about what actually</text><text start="6121.5" dur="2.88">happens in those rooms and how to think</text><text start="6123.179" dur="4.321">about it whatever that you just can&apos;t</text><text start="6124.38" dur="6.06">learn in college or online so</text><text start="6127.5" dur="4.92">um but if someone knows how to do the</text><text start="6130.44" dur="4.739">things you&apos;re interested in they&apos;re too</text><text start="6132.42" dur="4.38">busy so figure out what you can offer</text><text start="6135.179" dur="3.241">that they need</text><text start="6136.8" dur="3.96">because then you&apos;ll be gaining the</text><text start="6138.42" dur="4.38">capacity to become more of what you want</text><text start="6140.76" dur="4.979">to be these are a few pieces of advice</text><text start="6142.8" dur="5.04">for younger people out at offer</text><text start="6145.739" dur="5.281">yeah the two bottlenecks there one you</text><text start="6147.84" dur="7.319">mentioned well they&apos;re we&apos;re in the</text><text start="6151.02" dur="7.26">liminal space between in my opinion a um</text><text start="6155.159" dur="5.52">growth on fumes world and a post-growth</text><text start="6158.28" dur="4.98">world there&apos;s a lot of people big</text><text start="6160.679" dur="4.621">degrowth movement advocating for a</text><text start="6163.26" dur="4.2">smaller economy I think d-growth is what</text><text start="6165.3" dur="3.72">we should do but post growth is what</text><text start="6167.46" dur="4.32">we&apos;re going to have to do and I just</text><text start="6169.02" dur="5.639">don&apos;t think there&apos;s a lot of Mentor like</text><text start="6171.78" dur="5.52">people out there in the post-growth</text><text start="6174.659" dur="5.401">space because our current Master</text><text start="6177.3" dur="5.76">especially as things get more monetarily</text><text start="6180.06" dur="5.099">and civically stressful is we got to pay</text><text start="6183.06" dur="4.5">the bills so I I know you&apos;re not trying</text><text start="6185.159" dur="5.341">to speak to everyone</text><text start="6187.56" dur="5.119">um and I think it&apos;s excellent excellent</text><text start="6190.5" dur="4.98">advice but there aren&apos;t a lot of people</text><text start="6192.679" dur="4.54">living and focusing on the projects that</text><text start="6195.48" dur="5.1">we&apos;re going to need in the next 10 or 20</text><text start="6197.219" dur="5.641">years as potential mentors out there</text><text start="6200.58" dur="5.099">there are some for sure</text><text start="6202.86" dur="5.759">this is why the podcast is so cool as a</text><text start="6205.679" dur="5.281">format is it it allows people that you</text><text start="6208.619" dur="3.781">might not be able to access as a mentor</text><text start="6210.96" dur="3.6">one-on-one for you to be able to get</text><text start="6212.4" dur="5.52">some meaningful chunk of what they have</text><text start="6214.56" dur="5.94">to share which is amazing but</text><text start="6217.92" dur="5.94">no there are people who are</text><text start="6220.5" dur="5.04">like it may be the the capacities you</text><text start="6223.86" dur="4.14">want don&apos;t live in any one person right</text><text start="6225.54" dur="4.74">maybe that you really want to</text><text start="6228.0" dur="3.739">protect the Congo and that&apos;s going to</text><text start="6230.28" dur="4.02">require some</text><text start="6231.739" dur="4.721">amazing political strategy capability</text><text start="6234.3" dur="4.5">but also some environmental knowledge</text><text start="6236.46" dur="4.679">and some cultural knowledge so it may be</text><text start="6238.8" dur="5.1">that there are some environmentalists</text><text start="6241.139" dur="4.08">that understand the biodiversity risks</text><text start="6243.9" dur="2.46">associated with the Congo whatever well</text><text start="6245.219" dur="3.361">you need to study with them for a while</text><text start="6246.36" dur="4.02">to know that but there&apos;s also some just</text><text start="6248.58" dur="3.36">really effective political operators</text><text start="6250.38" dur="2.819">that are not working on that at all but</text><text start="6251.94" dur="3.719">where you get to learn how to</text><text start="6253.199" dur="3.841">effectively get [ __ ] done</text><text start="6255.659" dur="3.0">um in the political systems and you go</text><text start="6257.04" dur="3.659">study with them</text><text start="6258.659" dur="4.441">figuring out</text><text start="6260.699" dur="3.54">how to</text><text start="6263.1" dur="3.48">um</text><text start="6264.239" dur="4.92">be in proximity of the people that have</text><text start="6266.58" dur="4.2">capabilities you&apos;re wanting to develop</text><text start="6269.159" dur="3.54">is the fastest way to develop those</text><text start="6270.78" dur="6.0">capabilities</text><text start="6272.699" dur="6.381">okay getting to our three by three grid</text><text start="6276.78" dur="5.54">I think some of the things you&apos;ve been</text><text start="6279.08" dur="6.7">speaking to the last 30 minutes or so</text><text start="6282.32" dur="5.08">populate many of the boxes in this grid</text><text start="6285.78" dur="3.06">um how how would you like to approach</text><text start="6287.4" dur="3.06">this</text><text start="6288.84" dur="3.06">so when I talk about triage</text><text start="6290.46" dur="3.239">transitioning</text><text start="6291.9" dur="5.58">in long-term</text><text start="6293.699" dur="4.561">adequate Solutions sufficient Solutions</text><text start="6297.48" dur="4.699">um</text><text start="6298.26" dur="3.919">these are Horizons of focus</text><text start="6302.9" dur="3.94">there&apos;s lots of management theories that</text><text start="6305.219" dur="3.42">talk about something like this but I&apos;ll</text><text start="6306.84" dur="5.22">tell you how I think about it</text><text start="6308.639" dur="4.98">the triage basically means that there is</text><text start="6312.06" dur="3.54">some</text><text start="6313.619" dur="6.361">problem and particularly some</text><text start="6315.6" dur="5.519">catastrophic risk that has a non-nell</text><text start="6319.98" dur="3.78">likelihood</text><text start="6321.119" dur="4.62">over you know in the near term I&apos;m</text><text start="6323.76" dur="3.78">mostly not focused on things like the</text><text start="6325.739" dur="5.581">sun blowing out someday I&apos;m focused on</text><text start="6327.54" dur="7.38">pretty you know things within a</text><text start="6331.32" dur="7.2">within the years to decades time frame</text><text start="6334.92" dur="6.36">um and there&apos;s some</text><text start="6338.52" dur="4.86">problem like that that it does not seem</text><text start="6341.28" dur="3.66">the world has an adequate set of</text><text start="6343.38" dur="3.6">solutions already in place for so more</text><text start="6344.94" dur="4.08">needs done and probably needs done</text><text start="6346.98" dur="4.5">fairly quickly through whatever means</text><text start="6349.02" dur="4.02">necessary to avoid that</text><text start="6351.48" dur="4.139">when I say whatever means necessary I</text><text start="6353.04" dur="4.38">mean not necessarily total systemic</text><text start="6355.619" dur="5.04">Solutions but more just like direct</text><text start="6357.42" dur="4.86">implementation so if we are looking at</text><text start="6360.659" dur="4.261">something like</text><text start="6362.28" dur="5.1">the risks associated with the speed of</text><text start="6364.92" dur="4.38">growth of synthetic biology</text><text start="6367.38" dur="3.66">and</text><text start="6369.3" dur="4.56">and</text><text start="6371.04" dur="5.34">you know a direction of lots of viral</text><text start="6373.86" dur="5.52">hunting and gain of function research in</text><text start="6376.38" dur="5.46">League Laboratories with publishing of</text><text start="6379.38" dur="4.08">those Gene sequences that&apos;s just super</text><text start="6381.84" dur="4.14">super risky</text><text start="6383.46" dur="4.62">so things should be done to stop that</text><text start="6385.98" dur="4.38">that involved mostly</text><text start="6388.08" dur="4.38">uh some scientific work that says okay</text><text start="6390.36" dur="5.46">let&apos;s not do these things the benefit is</text><text start="6392.46" dur="7.04">not worth the risk and</text><text start="6395.82" dur="5.879">uh instead let&apos;s do these things for</text><text start="6399.5" dur="4.78">zoonotic pandemic</text><text start="6401.699" dur="5.341">you know spillover prevention and these</text><text start="6404.28" dur="4.5">things regarding information sharing and</text><text start="6407.04" dur="3.0">lab security and whatever and then</text><text start="6408.78" dur="3.72">there&apos;s like</text><text start="6410.04" dur="4.32">legal work to do right like legal work</text><text start="6412.5" dur="4.199">to get a couple of the main countries to</text><text start="6414.36" dur="5.22">do and then maybe you know</text><text start="6416.699" dur="5.221">the who to do something the G20 to do</text><text start="6419.58" dur="3.72">something that is adequate that&apos;s a</text><text start="6421.92" dur="3.12">triage type thing that&apos;s saying okay</text><text start="6423.3" dur="3.48">here&apos;s a risk</text><text start="6425.04" dur="3.78">and we don&apos;t need to get everybody to</text><text start="6426.78" dur="4.8">buy into something we basically need to</text><text start="6428.82" dur="3.72">show that the</text><text start="6431.58" dur="4.02">um</text><text start="6432.54" dur="5.04">the risk opportunity space needs</text><text start="6435.6" dur="3.84">something different done so there&apos;s some</text><text start="6437.58" dur="3.24">scientific work but it&apos;s this is a</text><text start="6439.44" dur="2.299">convening of a not large number of</text><text start="6440.82" dur="3.6">people</text><text start="6441.739" dur="4.9">and obviously you know this is a topic</text><text start="6444.42" dur="3.9">we have both actively worked on along</text><text start="6446.639" dur="3.06">with a number of other people but it&apos;s</text><text start="6448.32" dur="3.48">this is just one that kind of makes</text><text start="6449.699" dur="4.201">sense</text><text start="6451.8" dur="4.399">um and then there&apos;s legislation</text><text start="6453.9" dur="5.04">legislative work within existing</text><text start="6456.199" dur="3.881">legislative apparatus to be able to get</text><text start="6458.94" dur="2.759">that stuff done</text><text start="6460.08" dur="3.599">we could say a very similar thing of</text><text start="6461.699" dur="3.661">like</text><text start="6463.679" dur="3.121">uh</text><text start="6465.36" dur="5.4">protecting</text><text start="6466.8" dur="6.18">the ensuring that the Amazon doesn&apos;t uh</text><text start="6470.76" dur="4.5">get to the point of the hydrological</text><text start="6472.98" dur="4.5">pump breaking right a planetary boundary</text><text start="6475.26" dur="4.8">thing like that</text><text start="6477.48" dur="4.139">um okay well</text><text start="6480.06" dur="3.48">how would we think about how to do</text><text start="6481.619" dur="4.681">triage there effectively</text><text start="6483.54" dur="4.139">I&apos;m just going to talk through some</text><text start="6486.3" dur="3.0">principles of how to think about it</text><text start="6487.679" dur="3.241">because whether you&apos;re working in</text><text start="6489.3" dur="3.359">Ecuador to begin with it the headwaters</text><text start="6490.92" dur="3.719">of the Amazon or Brazil because it&apos;s the</text><text start="6492.659" dur="3.96">largest total amount of the Amazon or</text><text start="6494.639" dur="3.54">any of the other five you know five</text><text start="6496.619" dur="2.821">countries touching it or nine countries</text><text start="6498.179" dur="3.181">that have some involvement in the</text><text start="6499.44" dur="3.66">watersheds like you&apos;re going to do</text><text start="6501.36" dur="3.24">different things but</text><text start="6503.1" dur="4.2">principles</text><text start="6504.6" dur="3.96">the economic incentive whether it&apos;s from</text><text start="6507.3" dur="6.3">mining</text><text start="6508.56" dur="6.48">oil extraction or agriculture</text><text start="6513.6" dur="4.38">is going to be an ongoing pressure</text><text start="6515.04" dur="4.74">because those things that are going to</text><text start="6517.98" dur="3.739">not only keep being worth money many of</text><text start="6519.78" dur="5.939">them will keep being worth more money as</text><text start="6521.719" dur="7.781">population demands and Etc needs that</text><text start="6525.719" dur="5.52">and those forces can derive governments</text><text start="6529.5" dur="5.159">and they can</text><text start="6531.239" dur="5.101">put out commercials and um you know</text><text start="6534.659" dur="4.621">campaigns that affect the minds and</text><text start="6536.34" dur="6.359">hearts of people and they can do</text><text start="6539.28" dur="7.26">campaign budgets and uh they can pay</text><text start="6542.699" dur="7.321">lobbyists so the if the ngos that are</text><text start="6546.54" dur="5.82">fighting it are just fundamentally less</text><text start="6550.02" dur="4.199">capacitated in all those ways it&apos;s just</text><text start="6552.36" dur="3.359">not going to work so you&apos;ve got to think</text><text start="6554.219" dur="3.301">about all right</text><text start="6555.719" dur="3.121">factoring the forces that want to harm</text><text start="6557.52" dur="3.3">the thing we&apos;re wanting to protect it</text><text start="6558.84" dur="3.96">what forces are large enough to protect</text><text start="6560.82" dur="3.6">it right just even basic kind of</text><text start="6562.8" dur="4.2">strategic thinking</text><text start="6564.42" dur="4.38">and how could we get the forces that are</text><text start="6567.0" dur="3.659">large enough to care</text><text start="6568.8" dur="3.66">and it might not be by appealing to them</text><text start="6570.659" dur="3.06">with some kind of moral or environmental</text><text start="6572.46" dur="3.42">thing it might be some other things so</text><text start="6573.719" dur="4.081">in this case this is an example you and</text><text start="6575.88" dur="3.54">I&apos;ve talked about</text><text start="6577.8" dur="4.02">if the hydrological pump of the Amazon</text><text start="6579.42" dur="5.759">breaks</text><text start="6581.82" dur="5.46">meaning the water that transpires</text><text start="6585.179" dur="3.841">from all the trees it then rains down</text><text start="6587.28" dur="3.78">and keeps it as a rainforest but also</text><text start="6589.02" dur="3.54">pumps some of the groundwater into the</text><text start="6591.06" dur="4.02">air that becomes rain in North

dur="3.96">every year</text><text start="6598.32" dur="4.379">if the hydrological pump breaks because</text><text start="6600.48" dur="4.5">you&apos;ve got enough destruction that you</text><text

thing right you get this</text><text start="6608.4" dur="3.48">like the climate change Albedo effect</text><text start="6610.26" dur="3.959">there&apos;s a positive runaway thing that</text><text

dur="6.12">to ensure that it ameliorates this is</text><text start="6700.199" dur="5.281">just an example of triage strategic</text><text start="6703.56" dur="3.72">thinking we&apos;re not trying to

dur="4.02">of those countries better we&apos;re simply</text><text start="6710.46" dur="3.719">trying to think strategically more</text><text start="6712.679" dur="4.261">effectively about how to do a thing</text><text start="6714.179" dur="5.161">right that needs to be done a thousand</text><text start="6716.94" dur="4.5">things or ten thousand things</text><text start="6719.34" dur="4.08">this is what I would call the triage</text><text start="6721.44" dur="3.12">category and there are a lot of</text><text start="6723.42" dur="3.66">principles</text><text start="6724.56" dur="4.98">so I just gave a principle of whatever</text><text start="6727.08" dur="4.98">the forces arrayed against the thing</text><text start="6729.54" dur="4.44">make sure that you have competent forces</text><text start="6732.06" dur="3.24">similarly arrayed but they don&apos;t have to</text><text start="6733.98" dur="2.88">care about it for the same reason they</text><text start="6735.3" dur="3.18">have to care about it for a rationalized</text><text start="6736.86" dur="3.42">reason that speaks in the language they</text><text start="6738.48" dur="4.259">understand so who can help translate</text><text start="6740.28" dur="4.859">that that&apos;s one principle we could do a</text><text start="6742.739" dur="5.041">whole thing on how to do strategic</text><text start="6745.139" dur="4.381">thinking effectively but triage is</text><text start="6747.78" dur="4.439">largely</text><text start="6749.52" dur="4.56">that it&apos;s largely how do we get</text><text start="6752.219" dur="4.141">different players how do we get the</text><text start="6754.08" dur="4.86">economic incentives Etc to be able to do</text><text start="6756.36" dur="4.68">things that are needed and of course we</text><text start="6758.94" dur="3.42">still have to think through the</text><text start="6761.04" dur="2.579">externalities because there might be</text><text start="6762.36" dur="3.24">issues of having the state department to</text><text start="6763.619" dur="3.54">focus on the Amazon or so we have to</text><text start="6765.6" dur="3.3">think through that but that&apos;s what I</text><text start="6767.159" dur="3.901">would call the triage category and there</text><text start="6768.9" dur="3.66">is a lot in there and of course there&apos;s</text><text start="6771.06" dur="3.179">a lot of people already working on</text><text start="6772.56" dur="3.78">Frontline approaches for the Amazon</text><text start="6774.239" dur="4.081">they&apos;re just not thinking about</text><text start="6776.34" dur="3.6">what is the total threat landscape to</text><text start="6778.32" dur="3.72">the Amazon what are the Tipping points</text><text start="6779.94" dur="3.9">to not hit and what is a strategically</text><text start="6782.04" dur="4.619">adequate Focus</text><text start="6783.84" dur="5.46">and so</text><text start="6786.659" dur="4.98">that&apos;s one triage we could we could give</text><text start="6789.3" dur="5.879">a hundred other examples but I think</text><text start="6791.639" dur="5.701">that existing example category</text><text start="6795.179" dur="4.141">do we want to go horizontal or vertical</text><text start="6797.34" dur="4.02">here maybe you could stick with that</text><text start="6799.32" dur="4.74">example and look at transition and long</text><text start="6801.36" dur="5.339">term briefly</text><text start="6804.06" dur="5.04">or do you want to break the triage down</text><text start="6806.699" dur="5.52">between culture political economy and</text><text start="6809.1" dur="5.88">Tech stack yeah yeah so I&apos;ll give a</text><text start="6812.219" dur="4.5">transition example</text><text start="6814.98" dur="4.139">so</text><text start="6816.719" dur="4.561">having something like</text><text start="6819.119" dur="4.02">a state department</text><text start="6821.28" dur="3.06">or and I&apos;m giving one example there&apos;s</text><text start="6823.139" dur="4.02">obviously groups other than the state</text><text start="6824.34" dur="4.92">department that would also care but in</text><text start="6827.159" dur="4.921">the same way that I said earlier about</text><text start="6829.26" dur="4.68">who who are you politically polarizing</text><text start="6832.08" dur="3.72">against you and how could you get them</text><text start="6833.94" dur="3.179">on your side rather than not how do you</text><text start="6835.8" dur="4.08">get</text><text start="6837.119" dur="4.56">groups that don&apos;t currently care to care</text><text start="6839.88" dur="3.6">either that are larger or with a</text><text start="6841.679" dur="3.54">cumulative effect of how they care</text><text start="6843.48" dur="2.82">Stacks functions enough right that&apos;s</text><text start="6845.219" dur="3.0">just</text><text start="6846.3" dur="4.339">straightforward principle of kind of</text><text start="6848.219" dur="4.861">political thinking</text><text start="6850.639" dur="4.6">this is not changing the overall</text><text start="6853.08" dur="3.659">economic incentives in those countries</text><text start="6855.239" dur="4.321">or the mindsets of the people or</text><text start="6856.739" dur="4.801">anything so it&apos;s not a systemic effect</text><text start="6859.56" dur="5.4">this way called triage so transitional</text><text start="6861.54" dur="5.22">would be working with those in the</text><text start="6864.96" dur="3.06">institutions of those countries right</text><text start="6866.76" dur="3.3">they&apos;re</text><text start="6868.02" dur="5.699">Department of the Interior or its</text><text start="6870.06" dur="4.98">equivalent their Academy their academies</text><text start="6873.719" dur="3.541">and universities that are focused on</text><text start="6875.04" dur="4.92">these things their government security</text><text start="6877.26" dur="4.8">bodies their financial bodies how could</text><text start="6879.96" dur="3.6">we make those smarter how to make the</text><text start="6882.06" dur="3.78">Logics of them better so they do a</text><text start="6883.56" dur="6.5">better job with these types of things so</text><text start="6885.84" dur="4.22">an example there could be something like</text><text start="6890.94" dur="5.4">uh I learned this kind of thinking from</text><text start="6893.94" dur="5.34">a guy named Nelson Del Rio prosperity of</text><text start="6896.34" dur="4.44">the commons really smart lawyer who uh</text><text start="6899.28" dur="3.24">did a lot of the work on making the</text><text start="6900.78" dur="3.0">public-private partnership</text><text start="6902.52" dur="2.88">and then</text><text start="6903.78" dur="3.3">just legal structure and then saw how</text><text start="6905.4" dur="3.48">that got weaponized in a different</text><text start="6907.08" dur="4.44">structure</text><text start="6908.88" dur="4.56">but let&apos;s say let&apos;s say that we focused</text><text start="6911.52" dur="3.48">on Ecuador be because it&apos;s the</text><text start="6913.44" dur="3.66">headwaters of the Amazon so even though</text><text start="6915.0" dur="4.679">it&apos;s not the most total square meters</text><text start="6917.1" dur="4.38">it&apos;s the most critical square meters uh</text><text start="6919.679" dur="3.361">because you messed the headwaters up</text><text start="6921.48" dur="2.159">obviously the entire Basin gets messed</text><text start="6923.04" dur="2.28">up</text><text start="6923.639" dur="3.721">and</text><text start="6925.32" dur="3.72">we see that</text><text start="6927.36" dur="3.359">and I might have some of my stats wrong</text><text start="6929.04" dur="3.78">because I looked at this a couple years</text><text start="6930.719" dur="4.98">ago but so I&apos;m just using this as a</text><text start="6932.82" dur="6.6">random example but Ecuador owed a lot of</text><text start="6935.699" dur="6.901">money to both the World Bank and uh</text><text start="6939.42" dur="7.62">Chinese bank and some of that debt is</text><text start="6942.6" dur="6.72">collateralized with resource access</text><text start="6947.04" dur="4.86">and was not in a position to be able to</text><text start="6949.32" dur="5.58">pay that debt off well so what happens</text><text start="6951.9" dur="4.38">right does that threaten uh resource</text><text start="6954.9" dur="2.58">acquisition near the headquarter the</text><text start="6956.28" dur="2.7">Amazon that could mess up the Amazon</text><text start="6957.48" dur="3.78">basin</text><text start="6958.98" dur="3.84">if you start thinking about</text><text start="6961.26" dur="3.12">the relationship between the state</text><text start="6962.82" dur="3.06">department that might want to prevent</text><text start="6964.38" dur="3.48">the</text><text start="6965.88" dur="4.98">hydrological pump breaking for food</text><text start="6967.86" dur="5.279">security and the World Bank obviously</text><text start="6970.86" dur="4.68">uh the U.S and the World Bank are very</text><text start="6973.139" dur="4.621">related institutions right</text><text start="6975.54" dur="4.199">and so could the state department get</text><text start="6977.76" dur="4.26">the World Bank to</text><text start="6979.739" dur="3.96">change its debt structure debt</text><text start="6982.02" dur="3.0">forgiveness or things like that yeah</text><text start="6983.699" dur="3.061">totally could</text><text start="6985.02" dur="3.42">could the World Bank work with the</text><text start="6986.76" dur="3.66">Chinese bank to get it to do it as well</text><text start="6988.44" dur="4.38">based on if it was motivated enough</text><text start="6990.42" dur="4.38">International Financial agreements yeah</text><text start="6992.82" dur="4.62">I probably could do that as well</text><text start="6994.8" dur="4.5">if somebody could negotiate</text><text start="6997.44" dur="3.719">how to set that whole thing up of the</text><text start="6999.3" dur="3.6">state department support with</text><text start="7001.159" dur="4.56">the Forgiveness of the debt which is</text><text start="7002.9" dur="5.4">like 32 billion dollars like a lot of</text><text start="7005.719" dur="4.92">debt and then that would mean a lot to</text><text start="7008.3" dur="5.399">the government of Ecuador and it might</text><text start="7010.639" dur="5.58">not be know how to do that on their own</text><text start="7013.699" dur="4.201">now the country needs an economic</text><text start="7016.219" dur="3.96">development plan that doesn&apos;t involve</text><text start="7017.9" dur="4.56">running its rainforest assets so they</text><text start="7020.179" dur="4.56">probably need to in education process to</text><text start="7022.46" dur="4.14">do a lot more skilled labor</text><text start="7024.739" dur="4.681">and they probably need tech</text><text start="7026.6" dur="4.559">so let&apos;s say we somebody put together an</text><text start="7029.42" dur="3.48">economic development plan that involved</text><text start="7031.159" dur="4.201">bringing more Tech</text><text start="7032.9" dur="4.44">jobs and Tech capacity to the area and</text><text start="7035.36" dur="3.18">more education for more skilled labor so</text><text start="7037.34" dur="2.399">that you could still have Economic</text><text start="7038.54" dur="3.0">Development without as much</text><text start="7039.739" dur="3.721">environmental exploitation</text><text start="7041.54" dur="4.98">and let&apos;s say that to the degree there</text><text start="7043.46" dur="5.699">were some resources that needed to be</text><text start="7046.52" dur="4.44">extracted or exploited we helped make</text><text start="7049.159" dur="4.321">have that country develop its own</text><text start="7050.96" dur="4.44">National capability to do its minor</text><text start="7053.48" dur="3.719">extraction that employed people there as</text><text start="7055.4" dur="4.04">opposed to say a Chinese contractor that</text><text start="7057.199" dur="4.741">was employing Chinese people to do it or</text><text start="7059.44" dur="4.239">and that because of that had much</text><text start="7061.94" dur="3.96">stricter environmental regulation did a</text><text start="7063.679" dur="3.721">better version of it and private and</text><text start="7065.9" dur="3.0">held more of the wealth for Ecuador</text><text start="7067.4" dur="3.66">rather than more of it going to a</text><text start="7068.9" dur="3.779">multinational</text><text start="7071.06" dur="3.0">but they can&apos;t do that because they</text><text start="7072.679" dur="2.701">don&apos;t have that capacity on their own</text><text start="7074.06" dur="3.119">economically or whatever but they could</text><text start="7075.38" dur="2.88">be supported to so again I&apos;m saying if</text><text start="7077.179" dur="2.46">there is some group that is really</text><text start="7078.26" dur="3.18">caring about the Amazon they want to do</text><text start="7079.639" dur="3.361">a transitional thing could someone say</text><text start="7081.44" dur="3.96">all right here&apos;s a</text><text start="7083.0" dur="4.98">10 20 30 year economic development plan</text><text start="7085.4" dur="4.68">that involves some of those resources</text><text start="7087.98" dur="4.5">being extracted in a viable way that</text><text start="7090.08" dur="4.38">doesn&apos;t ruin the environment and provide</text><text start="7092.48" dur="3.719">jobs whatever but also provides a lot of</text><text start="7094.46" dur="5.159">Economic Development not on the resource</text><text start="7096.199" dur="4.621">extraction category and get you both a</text><text start="7099.619" dur="2.821">lot less environmental harm per</text><text start="7100.82" dur="5.399">extraction and more of the money from</text><text start="7102.44" dur="6.179">that extraction and we will help set</text><text start="7106.219" dur="4.201">that up and open the capital markets</text><text start="7108.619" dur="3.901">help negotiate the capital markets being</text><text start="7110.42" dur="3.66">able to fund this thing and you&apos;ll Bond</text><text start="7112.52" dur="3.06">back it so we can make sure that the</text><text start="7114.08" dur="3.18">capital markets can come into it will</text><text start="7115.58" dur="2.579">also help negotiate the release of your</text><text start="7117.26" dur="3.419">debt</text><text start="7118.159" dur="4.98">but here&apos;s the deal we&apos;re going to offer</text><text start="7120.679" dur="5.101">this deal to you as a package that</text><text start="7123.139" dur="4.201">includes excluding The Mining rights of</text><text start="7125.78" dur="3.72">all these other companies and the</text><text start="7127.34" dur="4.08">logging and the in the ranching and like</text><text start="7129.5" dur="4.199">that so you either get this deal in</text><text start="7131.42" dur="4.44">whole or not but you can&apos;t take this</text><text start="7133.699" dur="3.9">other thing that&apos;s happening on this why</text><text start="7135.86" dur="4.759">this is unique is because most people</text><text start="7137.599" dur="3.02">who focus on</text><text start="7140.9" dur="4.68">for benefit capitalism</text><text start="7144.08" dur="3.0">they&apos;re like okay well I can make money</text><text start="7145.58" dur="3.0">doing this good thing but it doesn&apos;t</text><text start="7147.08" dur="3.119">bind other people from doing the bad</text><text start="7148.58" dur="2.94">thing if I want to bind other people</text><text start="7150.199" dur="4.321">from doing the bad thing either have to</text><text start="7151.52" dur="5.639">create law that doesn&apos;t do it like</text><text start="7154.52" dur="5.28">you know make it illegal or contract law</text><text start="7157.159" dur="5.101">where those who would say allow the</text><text start="7159.8" dur="4.859">person allow the other kind uh you know</text><text start="7162.26" dur="4.14">multinational to come in and do the</text><text start="7164.659" dur="3.48">thing are not going to because there&apos;s</text><text start="7166.4" dur="5.16">an exclusive

dur="4.5">want to incentivize some positive thing</text><text start="7176.36" dur="4.92">I also want to bind the negative thing</text><text start="7178.28" dur="5.879">from not happening right so we

do need to be</text><text start="7374.36" dur="5.94">in dialogue</text><text start="7375.619" dur="8.641">okay and then vertically how do we think</text><text start="7380.3" dur="6.899">about culture political economy and Tech</text><text start="7384.26" dur="5.16">stack infrastructure on the bottom with</text><text start="7387.199" dur="4.5">respect to what you were just saying</text><text start="7389.42" dur="3.84">when you think about triage it&apos;s hard to</text><text start="7391.699" dur="3.54">separate them because you&apos;re looking at</text><text start="7393.26" dur="3.839">an eminent issue happening in which</text><text start="7395.239" dur="5.101">they&apos;re all kind of happening together</text><text start="7397.099" dur="5.58">right and so your triage solution might</text><text start="7400.34" dur="4.08">have to might have to affect cultural</text><text start="7402.679" dur="3.241">things because the mindsets of the</text><text start="7404.42"

dur="3.54">does not need everybody to agree it</text><text start="7413.36" dur="3.42">probably needs a very small number of</text><text start="7414.679" dur="4.621">people to agree</text><text start="7416.78" dur="4.8">um so how important culture is or not</text><text start="7419.3" dur="4.74">depends most people don&apos;t really have a</text><text start="7421.58" dur="4.079">say and do we go to nuclear war or not</text><text start="7424.04" dur="4.559">over a certain thing what is the point</text><text start="7425.659" dur="5.101">of nuclear escalation is so</text><text start="7428.599" dur="3.6">um and yet those who would do it still</text><text start="7430.76" dur="3.12">have to pay attention to political will</text><text start="7432.199" dur="4.561">to some degree</text><text start="7433.88" dur="6.359">um so</text><text start="7436.76" dur="6.479">I would say that you want to use</text><text start="7440.239" dur="4.86">Frameworks like this to think

start="7446.659" dur="5.04">the tech elements are but your triage</text><text start="7448.82" dur="5.899">Solutions are going to in are going to</text><text start="7451.699" dur="7.321">be focused on just immediate efficacy</text><text start="7454.719" dur="5.92">and they&apos;ll all three be very connected</text><text start="7459.02" dur="3.42">when you&apos;re thinking longer term</text><text start="7460.639" dur="3.96">transition I can think about culture in</text><text start="7462.44" dur="4.259">terms of like</text><text start="7464.599" dur="4.801">there are versions of all the

there are there are versions that</text><text start="7473.719" dur="3.721">are more kind of</text><text start="7475.52" dur="3.659">um non-violent forgiveness oriented</text><text start="7477.44" dur="4.62">universalists and other ones that are</text><text start="7479.179" dur="5.601">more fundamentalist religious oriented</text><text start="7482.06" dur="5.4">being able to support</text><text start="7484.78" dur="3.939">the more compatible versions of the</text><text start="7487.46" dur="3.36">religions flourishing more than the</text><text start="7488.719" dur="4.38">other ones is kind of a culture play</text><text start="7490.82" dur="3.54">long term that I don&apos;t have to think</text><text start="7493.099" dur="4.201">about</text><text start="7494.36" dur="4.98">the political economy and the tech to</text><text start="7497.3" dur="5.28">think about that though they are very</text><text start="7499.34" dur="4.98">very connected right if if I</text><text start="7502.58" dur="4.2">think about</text><text start="7504.32" dur="3.96">it how do I support the proliferation of</text><text start="7506.78" dur="3.48">a particular version well if I can help</text><text start="7508.28" dur="4.8">it develop more Tech and more financial</text><text start="7510.26" dur="4.56">capacities it becomes a lot easier for</text><text start="7513.08" dur="5.82">that version to proliferate if it also</text><text start="7514.82" dur="6.2">has more economic power behind it right</text><text start="7518.9" dur="2.12">um</text><text start="7521.599" dur="6.0">so I think we did a good job of giving a</text><text start="7525.08" dur="4.619">couple examples of triage</text><text start="7527.599" dur="3.6">on transition I&apos;d like to give a</text><text start="7529.699" dur="4.5">different example</text><text start="7531.199" dur="4.321">so like transition</text><text start="7534.199" dur="3.301">and then the difference between</text><text start="7535.52" dur="4.32">transition and long term</text><text start="7537.5" dur="5.52">let&apos;s say we&apos;re taking the United States</text><text start="7539.84" dur="6.18">Government Federal Government</text><text start="7543.02" dur="3.0">long-term</text><text start="7546.44" dur="3.36">the underlying structure of</text><text start="7548.179" dur="4.681">representative democracy is

dur="3.96">more simple</text><text start="7558.86" dur="4.259">um</text><text start="7560.119" dur="7.801">is there is no way to retrofit it</text><text start="7563.119" dur="6.681">adequately so specifically things like</text><text start="7567.92" dur="5.759">markets just get an advanced new tech</text><text start="7569.8" dur="6.24">and only after it has caused health or</text><text

dur="5.401">facto</text><text start="7584.179" dur="5.581">and so you know 80 years after leaded</text><text start="7588.5" dur="2.9">gasoline was causing problems you</text><text start="7589.76" dur="5.1">finally out</text><text start="7591.4" dur="5.68">outlawed or cigarettes or DDT</text><text start="7594.86" dur="4.5">you don&apos;t get to keep having a</text><text start="7597.08"

this externality process</text><text start="7611.239" dur="5.341">that we talked about to get regulatory</text><text start="7613.58" dur="4.32">okay for it to move forward and of</text><text start="7616.58" dur="3.48">course I&apos;m aware</text><text start="7617.9" dur="3.299">that it&apos;s very hard to concentrate that</text><text start="7620.06" dur="2.82">much power and not have it become</text><text start="7621.199" dur="3.121">corrupt and dystopic so of course there</text><text start="7622.88" dur="2.759">have to be checks and balances on that</text><text start="7624.32" dur="2.52">power and transparencies and they&apos;re</text><text start="7625.639" dur="5.04">really hard issues in there we can get</text><text start="7626.84" dur="5.66">into that but there is a need

start="7643.699" dur="5.52">system of government</text><text start="7646.52" dur="5.04">um obviously if we were going to rebuild</text><text start="7649.219" dur="4.741">a new</text><text

so there are a lot of long-term</text><text start="7664.82" dur="3.839">shifts where we think about how do we</text><text start="7666.739" dur="4.38">implement</text><text start="7668.659" dur="5.221">all of the information technology tools</text><text start="7671.119" dur="4.261">to factor all of the things and</text><text start="7673.88" dur="3.779">um</text><text start="7675.38" dur="4.5">I I could get it actually we should do</text><text start="7677.659" dur="4.02">one where we talk about the combinations</text><text start="7679.88" dur="3.839">of liquid democracy and

and just come back to</text><text start="7690.38" dur="4.14">transition because that was the example</text><text start="7691.88" dur="4.62">I wanted to do uh you said we should do</text><text

dur="3.06">people who run the political parties and</text><text start="7820.82" dur="4.02">stuff so there is some work to do but</text><text start="7822.56" dur="3.36">that is that&apos;s not triage right that&apos;s</text><text start="7824.84" dur="2.58">not going to solve a particular</text><text start="7825.92" dur="2.64">biosecurity risk it&apos;s not going to solve</text><text start="7827.42" dur="3.12">a nuclear it&apos;s not going to solve the</text><text start="7828.56" dur="3.24">environmental boundary but it&apos;s going to</text><text start="7830.54" dur="3.24">make something called the US federal</text><text start="7831.8" dur="4.439">government smarter and less stupid and</text><text start="7833.78" dur="4.859">less corrupt so all the things that it</text><text start="7836.239" dur="4.5">does will be better but it&apos;s going to do</text><text start="7838.639" dur="4.621">it in a way that works within its own</text><text start="7840.739" dur="3.92">existing system Logics so that&apos;s what I</text><text start="7843.26" dur="4.08">would call a transitional solution</text><text start="7844.659" dur="4.601">whereas how do we rebuild a digital</text><text start="7847.34" dur="3.42">democracy for from scratch that is a</text><text start="7849.26" dur="2.939">totally different kind of structure as a</text><text start="7850.76" dur="3.62">long-term solution</text><text start="7852.199" dur="4.621">so that&apos;s an example of thinking about</text><text start="7854.38" dur="5.259">the distinction between</text><text start="7856.82" dur="5.7">triage which is not systemic transition</text><text start="7859.639" dur="4.801">which is systemic but a change to</text><text start="7862.52" dur="4.38">existing systems and then the build of</text><text start="7864.44" dur="4.44">fundamentally new systems</text><text start="7866.9" dur="4.44">I&apos;m agreeing with everything you&apos;re</text><text start="7868.88" dur="4.62">saying but it&apos;s totally different than</text><text start="7871.34" dur="3.779">what I expected this conversation would</text><text start="7873.5" dur="4.219">be about I thought we would have</text><text start="7875.119" dur="6.12">discrete</text><text start="7877.719" dur="4.92">examples in the culture political</text><text start="7881.239" dur="5.46">economy</text><text start="7882.639" dur="7.121">Tech energy infrastructure stack and as</text><text start="7886.699" dur="5.281">you&apos;re talking it almost seems like</text><text start="7889.76" dur="5.82">the things that I would put in these</text><text start="7891.98" dur="6.02">nine boxes well to me it&apos;s all about</text><text start="7895.58" dur="5.519">triage now and it&apos;s almost like</text><text start="7898.0" dur="6.46">preparing the economy for the financial</text><text start="7901.099" dur="4.881">energy uh rubber band</text><text start="7904.46" dur="6.48">Snapback</text><text start="7905.98" dur="7.84">my work on on that it almost like</text><text start="7910.94" dur="5.699">enables you to work on all these other</text><text start="7913.82" dur="5.419">things like I think that is going to</text><text start="7916.639" dur="5.701">change the landscape of all these other</text><text start="7919.239" dur="6.661">examples that you were giving and and</text><text start="7922.34" dur="3.56">that has a very specific</text><text start="7928.06" dur="6.039">but I I just recognize that there&apos;s lots</text><text start="7932.0" dur="5.4">of these existential risks that may or</text><text start="7934.099" dur="4.681">may not happen certainly climate is</text><text start="7937.4" dur="3.96">happening and is going to happen</text><text start="7938.78" dur="5.1">regardless of what we do our attempts</text><text start="7941.36" dur="7.2">now are to minimize it and to cope with</text><text start="7943.88" dur="9.14">it uh as a species and culture but I I</text><text start="7948.56" dur="6.02">think we are years or a decade away from</text><text start="7953.02" dur="4.9">a</text><text start="7954.58" dur="5.019">recalibration of the musical chairs of</text><text start="7957.92" dur="4.08">Financial claims relative to the</text><text start="7959.599" dur="4.801">biophysical claims so I thought we might</text><text start="7962.0" dur="5.159">talk about oh well how does AI fit into</text><text start="7964.4" dur="5.819">that or how does blockchain fit into</text><text start="7967.159" dur="6.901">that and my answer to that is they would</text><text start="7970.219" dur="6.661">help uh extend the metabolism for a</text><text start="7974.06" dur="5.099">while longer at best but they&apos;re not</text><text start="7976.88" dur="4.819">they&apos;re not Solutions they&apos;re they&apos;re</text><text start="7979.159" dur="6.301">short-term fixes so what is the triage</text><text start="7981.699" dur="6.161">on how effectively eight billion people</text><text start="7985.46" dur="6.0">are going to have to deal with a smaller</text><text start="7987.86" dur="6.54">pie for the first time in 150 years and</text><text start="7991.46" dur="6.06">that is a very large conversation but I</text><text start="7994.4" dur="5.819">I do like the conceptual way in in which</text><text start="7997.52" dur="5.94">you&apos;re painting this but I I might have</text><text start="8000.219" dur="6.42">more discrete uh suggestions on on each</text><text start="8003.46" dur="5.219">of these boxes no let me say that a</text><text start="8006.639" dur="4.201">different way on the triage I would on</text><text start="8008.679" dur="4.681">the transition in longer term I think</text><text start="8010.84" dur="5.22">we&apos;re largely in agreement at least on</text><text start="8013.36" dur="5.879">the things you&apos;ve said so far</text><text start="8016.06" dur="5.579">yeah I mean I think with transition or</text><text start="8019.239" dur="4.201">triage I gave an example of biosecurity</text><text start="8021.639" dur="3.301">and an example of something like the</text><text start="8023.44" dur="5.1">hydrological pump of the Amazon we</text><text start="8024.94" dur="6.54">didn&apos;t get to triage examples on</text><text start="8028.54" dur="4.199">um right there&apos;s triage on every single</text><text start="8031.48" dur="3.96">issue</text><text start="8032.739" dur="5.041">yeah now I think we could do that I</text><text start="8035.44" dur="4.139">think we could say let&apos;s pick</text><text start="8037.78" dur="3.899">10 of the most pressing issues and give</text><text start="8039.579" dur="3.841">more examples there so really what we</text><text start="8041.679" dur="3.661">did so far was just lay out a framework</text><text start="8043.42" dur="4.14">to think about these things not anything</text><text start="8045.34" dur="4.02">like completion of that and we couldn&apos;t</text><text start="8047.56" dur="5.22">complete it but we could do quite a lot</text><text start="8049.36" dur="4.92">more so maybe if there was a</text><text start="8052.78" dur="4.08">follow-up we should have a hundred</text><text start="8054.28" dur="5.78">people at a three-day meeting talking</text><text start="8056.86" dur="5.52">about those all those boxes</text><text start="8060.06" dur="4.24">and we will</text><text start="8062.38" dur="3.719">um and if for this podcast as a</text><text start="8064.3" dur="4.2">follow-up maybe it would be a combo of</text><text start="8066.099" dur="4.5">uh</text><text start="8068.5" dur="4.139">a handful of areas in which you&apos;re</text><text start="8070.599" dur="3.0">thinking about triage Solutions and you</text><text start="8072.639" dur="3.181">share the things you&apos;re thinking about</text><text start="8073.599" dur="4.861">and we Dialogue on them with questions</text><text start="8075.82" dur="5.24">that the audience has that might be a</text><text start="8078.46" dur="2.6">really fun</text><text start="8082.96" dur="4.56">was really presenting Frameworks to</text><text start="8085.36" dur="4.68">think about what do how do you approach</text><text start="8087.52" dur="5.579">The Meta crisis more than something like</text><text start="8090.04" dur="6.48">a laundry list of the things to do</text><text start="8093.099" dur="6.54">I just feel this I I emotionally feel</text><text start="8096.52" dur="6.119">the intensity of this Bend versus break</text><text start="8099.639" dur="5.341">moment and I&apos;ve come to that because of</text><text start="8102.639" dur="4.44">my awareness of the connection between</text><text start="8104.98" dur="4.98">energy and finance but it sure seems</text><text start="8107.079" dur="4.681">that geopolitically we also have a uh</text><text start="8109.96" dur="6.06">are approaching a Bend versus break</text><text start="8111.76" dur="7.68">moment in many other ways so</text><text start="8116.02" dur="5.76">um I&apos;m getting uh urgent texts that I</text><text start="8119.44" dur="4.86">have to go and deal with animals because</text><text start="8121.78" dur="5.16">it&apos;s going to be very cold tonight so</text><text start="8124.3" dur="4.08">how would you like to wrap this up my</text><text start="8126.94" dur="3.06">friend</text><text start="8128.38" dur="3.299">I think</text><text start="8130.0" dur="4.739">um</text><text start="8131.679" dur="5.341">it makes plenty of sense for us to do a</text><text start="8134.739" dur="5.041">follow-up if there are questions and uh</text><text start="8137.02" dur="4.44">I&apos;m sure there will be questions</text><text start="8139.78" dur="4.26">and if there&apos;s more examples of</text><text start="8141.46" dur="5.699">solutions we&apos;d like to get into</text><text start="8144.04" dur="5.28">um and very likely ongoing conversations</text><text start="8147.159" dur="4.02">will keep being fun and valuable but I</text><text start="8149.32" dur="4.62">do feel like there&apos;s a certain Arc of</text><text start="8151.179" dur="4.081">completion that we got to of problem</text><text start="8153.94" dur="4.86">framing</text><text start="8155.26" dur="6.3">framing up how to be with that and then</text><text start="8158.8" dur="5.399">talking through how to think about</text><text start="8161.56" dur="4.679">how to approach</text><text start="8164.199" dur="3.781">how to work with it which is not a</text><text start="8166.239" dur="4.081">solution it&apos;s not a list of solutions</text><text start="8167.98" dur="5.28">it&apos;s a it&apos;s a way of thinking about and</text><text start="8170.32" dur="5.759">relating to the approach and</text><text start="8173.26" dur="5.22">uh I feel really good about that we got</text><text start="8176.079" dur="4.321">to have this whole dialogue and I am</text><text start="8178.48" dur="5.159">very interested to hear the questions</text><text start="8180.4" dur="7.14">that people have and if we</text><text start="8183.639" dur="7.02">have follow-ups soon that&apos;ll be great</text><text start="8187.54" dur="5.46">thank you next week is Thanksgiving and</text><text start="8190.659" dur="5.461">I&apos;m grateful for a lot of things I&apos;m</text><text start="8193.0" dur="7.08">grateful that our paths crossed and that</text><text start="8196.12" dur="7.14">we continue to uh be colleagues and</text><text start="8200.08" dur="5.88">share notes and ideas and connections</text><text start="8203.26" dur="6.54">because what else should we be doing</text><text start="8205.96" dur="6.36">with our time on this planet is swinging</text><text start="8209.8" dur="4.82">for the fences on um the human</text><text start="8212.32" dur="4.859">predicament you call it the medic crisis</text><text start="8214.62" dur="4.72">and we need orders of magnitude more</text><text start="8217.179" dur="3.72">people having these conversations in</text><text start="8219.34" dur="4.98">their communities in their networks</text><text start="8220.899" dur="6.361">around the world uh so I deeply value</text><text start="8224.32" dur="5.579">your your intellect and wisdom and your</text><text start="8227.26" dur="5.639">your generous Spirit of of sharing your</text><text start="8229.899" dur="3.861">time with others on this so thank you so</text><text start="8232.899" dur="4.5">much</text><text start="8233.76" dur="5.259">is uh a thing that some people could do</text><text start="8237.399" dur="2.881">if they&apos;ve helped called if people have</text><text start="8239.019" dur="2.7">listened to all five of these and they</text><text start="8240.28" dur="5.04">felt it was meaningful and they decided</text><text start="8241.719" dur="5.941">they wanted in there uh Community to</text><text start="8245.32" dur="4.619">host a watching series and then you know</text><text start="8247.66" dur="4.22">dial like create a support group of how</text><text start="8249.939" dur="4.021">do we help each other in our own</text><text start="8251.88" dur="3.519">development in this that&apos;d be a cool</text><text start="8253.96" dur="3.84">thing</text><text start="8255.399" dur="3.841">and uh what else should we do we should</text><text start="8257.8" dur="3.059">go tend to the animals when it&apos;s cold</text><text start="8259.24" dur="3.3">outside</text><text start="8260.859" dur="4.761">yeah so</text><text start="8262.54" dur="6.42">um I&apos;m gonna I&apos;m gonna do that you know</text><text start="8265.62" dur="4.84">between the time that this is recorded</text><text start="8268.96" dur="4.38">and

dur="5.34">development and uh having different</text><text start="8277.359" dur="4.381">perspectives is really really good and I</text><text start="8280.66" dur="4.26">do think</text><text start="8281.74" dur="7.14">Somewhere Out There we need to have this</text><text start="8284.92" dur="6.179">ability to temporarily suppress your own</text><text start="8288.88" dur="4.139">identity to be part of a larger</text><text start="8291.099" dur="4.321">conversation take other perspectives</text><text start="8293.019" dur="5.241">think systemically the way that you</text><text start="8295.42" dur="6.66">talked about uh in this podcast</text><text start="8298.26" dur="5.62">in a formal or semi-formal education</text><text start="8302.08" dur="4.439">system that you&apos;re experiencing this</text><text start="8303.88" dur="5.339">learning with other humans who then form</text><text start="8306.519" dur="5.061">bonds and there&apos;s this social network</text><text start="8309.219" dur="5.46">that that spills throughout the world</text><text start="8311.58" dur="6.279">and I I don&apos;t know how to formalize that</text><text start="8314.679" dur="5.34">but our education system is sorely</text><text start="8317.859" dur="4.801">lacking right now for the future that</text><text start="8320.019" dur="4.861">we&apos;re facing so if you&apos;re going to
