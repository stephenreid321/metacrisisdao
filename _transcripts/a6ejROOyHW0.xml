today&apos;s episode I just</text><text start="53.53" dur="4.14">wanted to do a life update so I&apos;ve</text><text start="55.449" dur="4.17">joined the MIT Media labs digital</text><text start="57.67" dur="3.959">currency initiative as their head of</text><text start="59.619" dur="4.47">community and long-term societal impact</text><text start="61.629" dur="5.67">which I&apos;m pretty excited about a really</text><text start="64.089" dur="4.621">nice group of blind people there so that</text><text start="67.299" dur="3.511">means that I&apos;m gonna shut down my</text><text start="68.71" dur="4.62">patreon I&apos;ve shut down my patreon and</text><text start="70.81" dur="4.65">that this podcast will likely continue</text><text start="73.33" dur="3.81">but possibly in a different form with</text><text start="75.46" dur="4.38">the Media Lab or with the DCI or</text><text start="77.14" dur="5.61">whatever so we&apos;ll see and I just another</text><text start="79.84" dur="5.099">quick note there my this podcast was</text><text start="82.75" dur="4.259">recorded before I joined the DCI so</text><text start="84.939" dur="4.11">clearly these are my views and do not</text><text start="87.009" dur="4.861">reflect those of the digital currency</text><text start="89.049" dur="4.771">initiative of the DCI so with that let&apos;s</text><text start="91.87" dur="4.62">get to today&apos;s episode and it&apos;s I</text><text start="93.82" dur="3.9">interview Danish Mactan burger today and</text><text start="96.49" dur="2.85">Daniel&apos;s done a lot of thinking about</text><text start="97.72" dur="3.33">these you know kind of complicated</text><text start="99.34" dur="4.14">complex macro systems that we live in</text><text start="101.05" dur="3.69">and that&apos;s just a quick I mean I don&apos;t</text><text start="103.48" dur="3.3">know if it&apos;s a warning it&apos;s also kind of</text><text start="104.74" dur="3.99">excitement Daniel and I really like</text><text start="106.78" dur="6.84">operating at these levels of abstraction</text><text start="108.73" dur="7.53">so that&apos;s where we got when we today</text><text start="113.62" dur="5.82">about one big topic which is a meta X</text><text start="116.26" dur="5.49">risk and so this is not only thinking</text><text start="119.44" dur="3.93">about kind of traditional and bi extras</text><text start="121.75" dur="3.6">I mean existential risk so this is not</text><text start="123.37" dur="3.359">traditional thing about like existential</text><text start="125.35" dur="3.629">risks like climate change nuclear</text><text start="126.729" dur="4.14">security biosecurity or AI alignment</text><text start="128.979" dur="4.59">instead it&apos;s asking a question what</text><text start="130.869" dur="4.531">actually creates those X risks what</text><text start="133.569" dur="4.59">creates those existential risks and you</text><text start="135.4" dur="4.35">can think of this as something like two</text><text start="138.159" dur="4.321">kinds of processes where we&apos;ve had</text><text start="139.75" dur="5.489">evolution as a process and evolution was</text><text start="142.48" dur="5.19">a generally a nice process that um thank</text><text start="145.239" dur="5.821">you evolution for creating me evolution</text><text start="147.67" dur="5.459">had micro rivalry but created macro anti</text><text start="151.06" dur="5.3">fragility right so the like the earth as</text><text start="153.129" dur="6.321">a entity that was a</text><text start="156.36" dur="6.87">a blossoming anti fragile symbiotic</text><text start="159.45" dur="6.0">nature thing but we&apos;ve humans have</text><text start="163.23" dur="4.26">created this new process as a result of</text><text start="165.45" dur="5.19">abstraction and design and technology</text><text start="167.49" dur="5.4">and science and this kind of process it</text><text start="170.64" dur="4.29">creates it has micro rivalry in the</text><text start="172.89" dur="4.89">sense of like market competition but it</text><text start="174.93" dur="4.41">doesn&apos;t have macro antifragility right</text><text start="177.78" dur="2.79">we don&apos;t have if you look at the world</text><text start="179.34" dur="3.3">today or something like the Industrial</text><text start="180.57" dur="4.05">Revolution Industrial Revolution was</text><text start="182.64" dur="4.61">created by a process and that process</text><text start="184.62" dur="5.52">doesn&apos;t have a built into that process</text><text start="187.25" dur="4.69">is not something that says hey let&apos;s</text><text start="190.14" dur="3.3">internalize our externalities or</text><text start="191.94" dur="2.76">you know let&apos;s close these loops and</text><text start="193.44" dur="5.16">instead we get something like climate</text><text start="194.7" dur="6.87">change and so these this process tack is</text><text start="198.6" dur="5.7">a process gives us these multipolar</text><text start="201.57" dur="4.889">traps with this exponential tech that</text><text start="204.3" dur="4.86">will produce these exponentially harmful</text><text start="206.459" dur="4.081">externalities eventually and so that&apos;s</text><text start="209.16" dur="2.79">the world that we live in and we need to</text><text start="210.54" dur="4.199">switch away we essentially need to</text><text start="211.95" dur="4.83">create a new kind of process design a</text><text start="214.739" dur="4.351">new kind of process that kind of takes</text><text start="216.78" dur="4.38">the best of both worlds here where we</text><text start="219.09" dur="4.77">have where we create macro</text><text start="221.16" dur="5.34">anti-fertility but it&apos;s not created as</text><text start="223.86" dur="5.25">an emergent process of evolution and the</text><text start="226.5" dur="6.38">micro rivalry but instead is actually</text><text start="229.11" dur="5.879">kind of by design by by us as humans so</text><text start="232.88" dur="6.4">that&apos;s primarily what we talk about</text><text start="234.989" dur="6.691">today and just as a quick note you know</text><text start="239.28" dur="4.35">we put a lot of context before this so</text><text start="241.68" dur="3.63">it&apos;s definitely juicy in the first 30</text><text start="243.63" dur="3.51">minutes but it gets especially juicy in</text><text start="245.31" dur="2.13">the last 30 minutes or we go deep on</text><text start="247.14" dur="3.43">this</text><text start="247.44" dur="5.57">so with that hope you enjoy the episode</text><text start="250.57" dur="5.0">[Music]</text><text start="253.01" dur="3.46">hello everybody my name is Rhys landmark</text><text start="255.57" dur="3.03">and you&apos;re listening to another episode</text><text start="256.47" dur="3.72">of creating a humanist blockchain future</text><text start="258.6" dur="2.79">in this podcast we take a systems</text><text start="260.19" dur="2.91">thinking approach to doing good in the</text><text start="261.39" dur="3.21">world we have a couple different series</text><text start="263.1" dur="3.72">to focus on different system scopes and</text><text start="264.6" dur="3.69">today we&apos;re focusing on series a macro</text><text start="266.82" dur="4.65">systems where he asked the question</text><text start="268.29" dur="5.34">where are we as humanity headed and to</text><text start="271.47" dur="3.66">dive into that question I&apos;m very happy</text><text start="273.63" dur="3.81">to introduce Danish Mactan Berger to</text><text start="275.13" dur="3.93">this show Daniel loves exploring various</text><text start="277.44" dur="3.18">topics of civilizational significance</text><text start="279.06" dur="3.21">trying to shake them for good and he&apos;s</text><text start="280.62" dur="3.24">one of the best systems vocal processors</text><text start="282.27" dur="3.12">I know and much of my own thinking has</text><text start="283.86" dur="4.1">been shaped by him so Daniel thanks for</text><text start="285.39" dur="5.79">being on the show and welcome my friend</text><text start="287.96" dur="4.33">me too okay so we&apos;re really gonna push</text><text start="291.18" dur="3.54">the question where are we as humanity</text><text start="292.29" dur="5.37">headed today and let&apos;s gonna start at</text><text start="294.72" dur="4.74">the top here and before talking kind of</text><text start="297.66" dur="3.6">too deeply about our current context or</text><text start="299.46" dur="3.09">what&apos;s happening Daniel how do you think</text><text start="301.26" dur="3.36">about kind of goals like what do you</text><text start="302.55" dur="3.27">think about goals for our civilization</text><text start="304.62" dur="3.06">or when you&apos;re trying to like you know</text><text start="305.82" dur="5.36">optimize for a metric or something like</text><text start="307.68" dur="7.53">that what are your big goals mm-hmm so</text><text start="311.18" dur="6.4">before talking about what I think good</text><text start="315.21" dur="5.13">goals would be I think the question</text><text start="317.58" dur="4.92">you&apos;re actually asking about is is a</text><text start="320.34" dur="4.83">goal-oriented framework actually a</text><text start="322.5" dur="5.18">adequate or good framework or they&apos;re</text><text start="325.17" dur="6.0">other frameworks we want to take and so</text><text start="327.68" dur="5.95">obviously Western culture has been and</text><text start="331.17" dur="5.22">particularly industrial post scientific</text><text start="333.63" dur="5.88">technological and even computational</text><text start="336.39" dur="6.36">culture has been very oriented to goals</text><text start="339.51" dur="5.37">kind of process and we can attribute</text><text start="342.75" dur="4.08">both lots of successes and most of the</text><text start="344.88" dur="3.06">failures of the world or many of the</text><text start="346.83" dur="5.34">failures of the world to that process</text><text start="347.94" dur="6.42">because if I define a goal and it</text><text start="352.17" dur="4.08">doesn&apos;t include everything that will be</text><text start="354.36" dur="4.35">affected by the nature of what I do to</text><text start="356.25" dur="4.11">get there then whatever is affected that</text><text start="358.71" dur="3.33">I didn&apos;t define as part of my goal as</text><text start="360.36" dur="5.99">the space where externalities can happen</text><text start="362.04" dur="8.28">and even in the you know very</text><text start="366.35" dur="6.19">well-intentioned nonprofit you know</text><text start="370.32" dur="4.98">whatever kinds of sectors we see all the</text><text start="372.54" dur="5.69">time having things like okay so we have</text><text start="375.3" dur="5.94">a goal to end extreme poverty and</text><text start="378.23" dur="4.57">childhood hunger globally or within a</text><text start="381.24" dur="3.36">particular area that seems like a pretty</text><text start="382.8" dur="2.67">awesome goal as well she&apos;s ever seen the</text><text start="384.6" dur="3.36">child who&apos;s hungry or</text><text start="385.47" dur="5.25">mother watching her child be hungry the</text><text start="387.96" dur="5.73">tricky thing is if my only goal is to</text><text start="390.72" dur="4.91">end hunger I can do it through Unruh</text><text start="393.69" dur="4.71">noble agricultural methods that dump</text><text start="395.63" dur="5.88">nitrogen into the river deltas removing</text><text start="398.4" dur="6.99">dead zones in the ocean even faster</text><text start="401.51" dur="5.8">moving us towards actually extinction as</text><text start="405.39" dur="5.88">a species and collapse of the biosphere</text><text start="407.31" dur="5.22">writ large which is okay so we prevented</text><text start="411.27" dur="2.52">some people from dying over the very</text><text start="412.53" dur="4.77">short term and made it more likely that</text><text start="413.79" dur="5.85">everyone dies with medium term yeah so</text><text start="417.3" dur="4.08">at minimum when we think about goals we</text><text start="419.64" dur="3.45">could at least just start by this hand</text><text start="421.38" dur="5.61">waving kind of thing of saying our goal</text><text start="423.09" dur="6.69">is X whatever X is right stop extreme</text><text start="426.99" dur="5.73">poverty and just add this little caveat</text><text start="429.78" dur="6.9">which is our goal is to do that and not</text><text start="432.72" dur="7.38">externalize harm to anything else that</text><text start="436.68" dur="5.88">matters and now when you start exploring</text><text start="440.1" dur="4.05">how do I know what else might be</text><text start="442.56" dur="3.81">affected that could have harm</text><text start="444.15" dur="6.03">externalize that isn&apos;t obvious in very</text><text start="446.37" dur="7.59">complex systems and with technology that</text><text start="450.18" dur="5.52">has lots of different causal dynamics</text><text start="453.96" dur="4.05">that are associated and then the</text><text start="455.7" dur="5.04">question of what are other things that</text><text start="458.01" dur="4.53">matter and what is my ethical and</text><text start="460.74" dur="5.31">existential framework for assessing that</text><text start="462.54" dur="6.27">then you start to realize that that kind</text><text start="466.05" dur="4.679">of hand wave leads it way to a much</text><text start="468.81" dur="5.43">deeper process of what we might call</text><text start="470.729" dur="4.891">omni consideration yeah let me pause you</text><text start="474.24" dur="2.55">for a second actually there because I</text><text start="475.62" dur="4.049">think that there&apos;s a lot of good juicy</text><text start="476.79" dur="4.74">stuff a as you said we&apos;re kind of so</text><text start="479.669" dur="4.531">used to thinking of this goal framework</text><text start="481.53" dur="4.71">and it&apos;s almost it&apos;s hard to get out of</text><text start="484.2" dur="3.75">it in some ways and like you say I super</text><text start="486.24" dur="3.929">girth you say once we create a goal</text><text start="487.95" dur="4.02">whatever that goal is X and you also say</text><text start="490.169" dur="3.241">what are all the externalities of X and</text><text start="491.97" dur="3.15">how can we make sure that we&apos;re you know</text><text start="493.41" dur="3.36">minimizing the negative externalities</text><text start="495.12" dur="5.43">and upping the positive externalities of</text><text start="496.77" dur="5.43">that X is there I guess to go a little</text><text start="500.55" dur="3.57">bit deeper on that this kind of goals</text><text start="502.2" dur="3.63">perspective and you kind of start to</text><text start="504.12" dur="4.23">allude to the stomach&apos;s is like there</text><text start="505.83" dur="4.32">are there are people in the world so I</text><text start="508.35" dur="4.819">would say I&apos;m like a relative kind of</text><text start="510.15" dur="5.25">effective altruism list in terms of I</text><text start="513.169" dur="3.67">agree with you know generally agree with</text><text start="515.4" dur="3.95">like consequentialism and kind of</text><text start="516.839" dur="3.921">outcome-focused ends focused mindsets</text><text start="519.35" dur="3.39">those are all kind of goal they have</text><text start="520.76" dur="2.88">kind of goals as a part of them so how</text><text start="522.74" dur="3.54">do you think about something like</text><text start="523.64" dur="4.2">effective altruism as kind of a mostly a</text><text start="526.28" dur="4.08">goal focused or kind of an outcome</text><text start="527.84" dur="4.14">focused mindset is that going to be is</text><text start="530.36" dur="7.65">that good for shaping the world</text><text start="531.98" dur="8.34">positively effective altruism is a</text><text start="538.01" dur="4.59">valuable step in the consideration</text><text start="540.32" dur="5.7">process of saying if we really care</text><text start="542.6" dur="7.14">about having actions that have a</text><text start="546.02" dur="7.32">positive impact on life at large how do</text><text start="549.74" dur="5.61">we go about influencing our choice</text><text start="553.34" dur="5.7">making basis of what will be effective</text><text start="555.35" dur="7.65">and how can we use very effective tools</text><text start="559.04" dur="6.6">like rationality to inform better choice</text><text start="563.0" dur="5.07">so insofar as it&apos;s asking what are the</text><text start="565.64" dur="6.9">right epistemic frameworks to inform</text><text start="568.07" dur="6.87">good choice that&apos;s a great step now of</text><text start="572.54" dur="6.2">course I&apos;m going to say that it is a</text><text start="574.94" dur="9.12">limited step and the limits are actually</text><text start="578.74" dur="6.52">fatal and the direction and permeate</text><text start="584.06" dur="3.96">rates have to happen so here&apos;s a couple</text><text start="585.26" dur="5.46">examples when we talk about the limits</text><text start="588.02" dur="5.31">of goals because the goal is always</text><text start="590.72" dur="5.07">embedded within a larger context and so</text><text start="593.33" dur="4.71">you have to factor it&apos;s in the embedding</text><text start="595.79" dur="4.65">functions and that&apos;s where the topic of</text><text start="598.04" dur="4.26">externality comes and how even think</text><text start="600.44" dur="4.53">through externality we&apos;re mostly only</text><text start="602.3" dur="3.99">going to forecast within domains that we</text><text start="604.97" dur="3.72">already know a lot so as we&apos;re getting</text><text start="606.29" dur="4.17">into exponential technology where there</text><text start="608.69" dur="6.33">are faster rates of change more</text><text start="610.46" dur="6.27">complicated more complex systems etc</text><text start="615.02" dur="4.85">then there&apos;s more stuff that&apos;s going to</text><text start="616.73" dur="5.82">happen that we don&apos;t forecast well and</text><text start="619.87" dur="4.63">faster coupling from the micro context</text><text start="622.55" dur="3.57">to the macro context it used to be that</text><text start="624.5" dur="4.05">whatever happened in a microwave wasn&apos;t</text><text start="626.12" dur="4.32">going to affect the biosphere or human</text><text start="628.55" dur="3.27">civilization at large because stone</text><text start="630.44" dur="3.75">tools just don&apos;t have as big a</text><text start="631.82" dur="6.48">consequence as AI or nanotech biotech do</text><text start="634.19" dur="6.6">and so because of the larger scale and</text><text start="638.3" dur="4.85">faster timeline coupling coefficients of</text><text start="640.79" dur="4.38">micro action to macro dynamics</text><text start="643.15" dur="3.64">externality is that much bigger of a</text><text start="645.17" dur="3.18">topic right and it&apos;s an exponentially</text><text start="646.79" dur="3.48">bigger topic so let&apos;s just take small</text><text start="648.35" dur="3.75">cases and didn&apos;t look at what happens</text><text start="650.27" dur="2.819">when you put that on an exponential</text><text start="652.1" dur="3.539">curve</text><text start="653.089" dur="4.11">so say we take medicine because in</text><text start="655.639" dur="3.57">medicine we&apos;re talking about what is</text><text start="657.199" dur="4.56">health and but in a body that&apos;s a</text><text start="659.209" dur="4.53">complex system but we take a complicated</text><text start="661.759" dur="3.9">approach of trying to define health in</text><text start="663.739" dur="5.64">terms of a finite number of metrics so</text><text start="665.659" dur="5.37">we&apos;re going to look at your low density</text><text start="669.379" dur="3.21">lipoprotein and your high density</text><text start="671.029" dur="3.15">lipoprotein and a couple different</text><text start="672.589" dur="3.63">cholesterol metrics and blood pressure</text><text start="674.179" dur="3.51">and blood sugar and whatever in and as</text><text start="676.219"

the method</text><text start="742.909" dur="4.26">that we&apos;re using etc so then we can say</text><text start="745.219" dur="4.41">well the statin works for that but not</text><text start="747.169"

in</text><text start="837.32" dur="5.22">different people so now we have to</text><text start="838.85" dur="6.24">actually not do a generalized bell curve</text><text start="842.54"

find is then we look at the LDL</text><text start="892.85" dur="4.26">and say okay so we want to look at LDL</text><text start="894.53" dur="4.62">and these liver enzymes and a few other</text><text start="897.11" dur="4.62">things and then we try and put more</text><text start="899.15" dur="5.12">metrics and run optimization on those</text><text start="901.73" dur="6.72">metrics which didn&apos;t we say big data and</text><text start="904.27" dur="7.09">and machine learning will help us do but</text><text start="908.45" dur="5.91">this is the kind of the key thing no</text><text start="911.36" dur="4.38">matter how many metrics there&apos;s a couple</text><text start="914.36" dur="2.85">things here when we say that goals are</text><text start="915.74" dur="4.48">limited we also are saying that</text><text start="917.21" dur="5.65">optimization theory is limited</text><text start="920.22" dur="5.28">for a couple critical reasons so now I</text><text start="922.86" dur="7.469">go from two metrics to 200 or 2000</text><text start="925.5" dur="6.72">metrics but there&apos;s still other things</text><text start="930.329" dur="3.661">that are happening that are outside of</text><text start="932.22" dur="4.919">the metrics that I&apos;m seeking to optimize</text><text start="933.99" dur="5.07">that are mostly in either the beyond</text><text start="937.139" dur="3.841">factorable within this model or the</text><text start="939.06" dur="4.68">actual unknown unknowns but that might</text><text start="940.98" dur="4.589">be critical to the whole system and so</text><text start="943.74" dur="2.94">when I&apos;m running optimization on these</text><text start="945.569" dur="3.51">end metrics</text><text start="946.68" dur="3.48">I&apos;m also affecting a lot of other stuff</text><text start="949.079" dur="2.791">that I&apos;m not paying attention to</text><text start="950.16" dur="4.2">optimize which is this places where I&apos;ll</text><text start="951.87" dur="3.69">probably externalize harm is I&apos;m driving</text><text start="954.36" dur="2.459">a system where all those things are</text><text start="955.56" dur="2.399">interconnected without actually</text><text start="956.819" dur="3.87">acknowledging they&apos;re in the correct and</text><text start="957.959" dur="4.68">infected in other words our model of a</text><text start="960.689" dur="4.411">complex system is not how the complex</text><text start="962.639" dur="4.471">system actually works so when we treat</text><text start="965.1" dur="3.69">the actual reality as the model and we</text><text start="967.11" dur="3.419">try and optimize for the model the place</text><text start="968.79" dur="4.77">in which the reality is not the model</text><text start="970.529" dur="5.521">gets up and so when you define a</text><text start="973.56" dur="4.649">complex system as something that has an</text><text start="976.05" dur="3.779">emergent property beyond how you model</text><text start="978.209" dur="4.23">it when you model it you get certain</text><text start="979.829" dur="5.94">system dynamics awesome complicated</text><text start="982.439" dur="5.25">system complex system is the predicted</text><text start="985.769" dur="3.601">dynamics of the model don&apos;t explain all</text><text start="987.689" dur="3.601">of the dynamics then you have to say</text><text start="989.37" dur="3.48">it&apos;s very different epistemology other</text><text start="991.29" dur="3.57">than n-dimensional metrics an</text><text start="992.85" dur="4.32">optimization theory to account for what</text><text start="994.86" dur="4.5">is actually going on so pause for a</text><text start="997.17" dur="4.769">second so I agree with a lot of that and</text><text start="999.36" dur="4.89">I want to talk about this sec but so you</text><text start="1001.939" dur="3.96">talked about the I agree there&apos;s a bad</text><text start="1004.25" dur="3.3">forecasting piece or we live in this</text><text start="1005.899" dur="4.771">world where we have Black Swan style</text><text start="1007.55" dur="5.909">events and over hyper interconnected</text><text start="1010.67" dur="4.589">lots of power dynamics of external or</text><text start="1013.459" dur="5.041">lots of sorry Exponential&apos;s happening</text><text start="1015.259" dur="5.25">and when all that happens if we set our</text><text start="1018.5" dur="4.709">goals and then don&apos;t account for the</text><text start="1020.509" dur="4.05">externalities or actions then the sad</text><text start="1023.209" dur="2.281">externalities can turn out to be really</text><text start="1024.559" dur="3.181">big because everything&apos;s so</text><text start="1025.49" dur="3.48">interconnected and powerful now and I</text><text start="1027.74" dur="2.429">agree with what you&apos;re saying when you</text><text start="1028.97" dur="3.06">think about any of these actions and</text><text start="1030.169" dur="3.15">this gets into how kind of to think</text><text start="1032.03" dur="2.97">about this stuff is like when you think</text><text start="1033.319" dur="5.041">about taking an action before you do it</text><text start="1035.0" dur="4.38">think hey why is there this problem in</text><text start="1038.36" dur="2.849">the first place to try to go to that</text><text start="1039.38" dur="3.289">root cause level and then B what are the</text><text start="1041.209" dur="4.441">externalities of that action</text><text start="1042.669" dur="4.691">so in this final piece which you&apos;re</text><text start="1045.65" dur="3.42">getting to here&apos;s this map is not the</text><text start="1047.36" dur="4.17">territory thing here and it&apos;s especially</text><text start="1049.07" dur="3.41">true for complex systems and so I just</text><text start="1051.53" dur="3.05">kind of want to recap</text><text start="1052.48" dur="3.9">that&apos;s tougher listener and then have</text><text start="1054.58" dur="4.44">you go and say okay so if we can&apos;t use</text><text start="1056.38" dur="3.48">this if I can&apos;t just keep adding metrics</text><text start="1059.02" dur="2.399">to MySpace</text><text start="1059.86" dur="3.059">is there an AK what is the new</text><text start="1061.419" dur="2.911">epistemology that I should be thinking</text><text start="1062.919" dur="3.451">about that will actually allow me to</text><text start="1064.33" dur="4.68">allow us to to succeed in this new world</text><text start="1066.37" dur="4.35">right so I want to share another</text><text start="1069.01" dur="6.24">framework that will help the</text><text start="1070.72" dur="6.27">consideration here and this is not a</text><text start="1075.25" dur="4.08">happy thought at first but it&apos;s a</text><text start="1076.99" dur="4.62">necessary thought which leads us to be</text><text start="1079.33" dur="5.839">more effective in considering how to</text><text start="1081.61" dur="7.11">have happy thoughts around this so it is</text><text start="1085.169" dur="6.431">that it is a lot easier to break</text><text start="1088.72" dur="9.18">than it is to actually protect or build</text><text start="1091.6" dur="8.79">stuff and there is a entropic preference</text><text start="1097.9" dur="4.56">that we have to consider and just to</text><text start="1100.39" dur="4.56">have a very simple kind of prima facie</text><text start="1102.46" dur="5.94">of that the house that I&apos;m in probably</text><text start="1104.95" dur="6.9">took a year to build and the record ball</text><text start="1108.4" dur="5.85">can take it down in minutes and if you</text><text start="1111.85" dur="4.01">think about an old-growth forest and the</text><text start="1114.25" dur="3.39">thousands of years it takes to get the</text><text start="1115.86" dur="3.58">biodiversity and complexity of that</text><text start="1117.64" dur="4.5">forest and how long it takes with a fire</text><text start="1119.44" dur="4.53">or a d9 that take it down you really get</text><text start="1122.14" dur="4.62">a sense of the orders of magnitude of</text><text start="1123.97" dur="4.949">the timelines for construction versus</text><text start="1126.76" dur="7.59">destruction of complicated or complex</text><text start="1128.919" dur="6.931">systems and everything from from things</text><text start="1134.35" dur="3.72">like that how long does it take to build</text><text start="1135.85" dur="4.62">a globalized infrastructure and how</text><text start="1138.07" dur="3.78">quickly could we actually break it all</text><text start="1140.47" dur="2.85">the way to how long does it take to</text><text start="1141.85" dur="4.53">build trust and how easy is it to break</text><text start="1143.32" dur="4.68">it and so when you factor that you</text><text start="1146.38" dur="4.62">realize that there&apos;s a couple orders of</text><text start="1148.0" dur="5.669">magnitude more ways to break stuff than</text><text start="1151.0" dur="5.19">to build it in faster time processes on</text><text start="1153.669" dur="3.781">that so when I&apos;m factoring externalities</text><text start="1156.19" dur="3.26">and I&apos;m thinking

say one other thing</text><text start="1339.26" dur="5.1">that I think read some of the context</text><text start="1341.03" dur="5.399">great one of the important things to</text><text start="1344.36" dur="4.53">consider when we think about the topic</text><text start="1346.429" dur="3.931">of negative externalities that so one</text><text start="1348.89" dur="3.659">thing we just said is the kind of</text><text start="1350.36" dur="4.17">entropic gradient right so we have to</text><text start="1352.549" dur="5.13">factor that another key thing is the</text><text start="1354.53" dur="5.3">topic of weaponization if I create a new</text><text start="1357.679" dur="6.24">technology and it is the capacity to</text><text start="1359.83" dur="6.01">affect change through the causal

dur="4.86">lots of kinds of choices right and so</text><text start="1382.19" dur="5.22">one of the things we have to understand</text><text start="1384.169" dur="7.231">is that the moment we actually deploy a</text><text start="1387.41" dur="7.53">type of asymmetric technology then it</text><text start="1391.4" dur="6.42">gets reverse engineered iterated upon</text><text start="1394.94" dur="8.55">and utilized for all purposes that are</text><text start="1397.82" dur="6.9">incentivized by all agents and so I had</text><text start="1403.49" dur="3.09">just had some guys talk with me the</text><text start="1404.72" dur="4.05">other day about an AI project they were</text><text start="1406.58" dur="4.71">working on of how they could use some AI</text><text start="1408.77" dur="5.01">information technology that was novel</text><text start="1411.29" dur="4.95">they just developed to get out some type</text><text start="1413.78" dur="6.269">of what they thought were positive</text><text start="1416.24" dur="5.49">political agendas to solve some current</text><text start="1420.049" dur="3.781">near-term problems and I&apos;m like and you</text><text start="1421.73" dur="3.569">don&apos;t think that the other side&apos;s that</text><text start="1423.83" dur="3.93">have as much incentive and pretty good</text><text start="1425.299" dur="4.351">Intel will pay attention to the new</text><text start="1427.76" dur="3.419">technology you have reverse engineering</text><text start="1429.65" dur="3.51">and utilize it for the other

dur="4.591">happen and I said now take all of the</text><text start="1437.059" dur="4.381">sides in this multi agent dynamic that</text><text start="1439.4" dur="3.6">all have rival risks incentive to</text><text start="1441.44" dur="4.59">weaponize the technology against each</text><text start="1443.0" dur="6.48">other for their agendas and all you do</text><text start="1446.03" dur="6.02">is up the ante of the playing field and</text><text start="1449.48" dur="4.16">so nukes didn&apos;t actually make us safer</text><text start="1452.05" dur="3.78">like they made a safer but we actually</text><text start="1453.64" dur="4.38">have increased risk of existential risk</text><text start="1455.83" dur="3.96">from nuclear warfare relative to a world</text><text start="1458.02" dur="5.22">that had just never developed nukes okay</text><text start="1459.79" dur="5.61">and so this is the multipolar trap where</text><text start="1463.24" dur="4.05">each agent doing the thing that seems</text><text start="1465.4" dur="3.96">like it provides and whether the agent</text><text start="1467.29" dur="4.74">is a person or a country or a company or</text><text start="1469.36" dur="4.41">whatever each agent doing the thing that</text><text start="1472.03" dur="3.75">seems like it&apos;s best for what they care</text><text start="1473.77" dur="4.32">about in the near-term actually leads to</text><text start="1475.78" dur="4.17">a system disposition that is worse for</text><text start="1478.09" dur="4.86">the system as a whole over the long term</text><text start="1479.95" dur="5.67">and this is what we call a multipolar</text><text start="1482.95" dur="4.89">track or a race to the bottom right a</text><text start="1485.62" dur="4.38">tragedy of the

dur="6.72">race to the bottom type scenario so one</text><text start="1494.92" dur="7.26">thing can say is in terms of goals or</text><text start="1498.73" dur="5.43">necessary criteria of system design time</text><text start="1502.18" dur="4.17">constraints is that we have to solve not</text><text start="1504.16" dur="3.84">just for some multipolar tribe but</text><text start="1506.35" dur="4.65">categorically for the class of</text><text start="1508.0" dur="5.37">multipolar traps as long as you have a</text><text start="1511.0" dur="4.26">rival risk incentive to utilize</text><text

on that great and</text><text start="1531.1" dur="3.36">so i agree with this and this is in</text><text start="1532.93" dur="3.99">something that you call like the</text><text start="1534.46" dur="4.14">generator functions of x risk and these</text><text start="1536.92" dur="2.82">are these these multipolar traps and you</text><text start="1538.6" dur="3.09">can look at it when you think about the</text><text start="1539.74" dur="3.81">existential risks that exist today there</text><text start="1541.69" dur="3.36">are things like nuclear security and</text><text start="1543.55" dur="3.0">that&apos;s an arms race it&apos;s like you know</text><text start="1545.05" dur="3.33">couldn&apos;t we have stopped at like I mean</text><text start="1546.55" dur="3.75">maybe like three nukes or something but</text><text start="1548.38" dur="3.24">now we have thousands of nukes and you</text><text start="1550.3" dur="3.27">think about biotech again it&apos;s like</text><text start="1551.62" dur="3.24">people doing things there in these</text><text start="1553.57" dur="3.12">win-lose game dynamics where if they</text><text start="1554.86" dur="3.45">stop and if they don&apos;t if they don&apos;t go</text><text start="1556.69" dur="3.11">quicker and same with like artificial</text><text start="1558.31" dur="4.68">intelligence alignment it&apos;s like ooh</text><text start="1559.8" dur="4.48">maybe Google and Baidu and the you know</text><text start="1562.99" dur="3.54">Chinese government&apos;s new whoever are</text><text start="1564.28" dur="3.69">going to be nice around and be and try</text><text start="1566.53" dur="2.91">to be safe but actually they&apos;re gonna be</text><text start="1567.97" dur="3.65">in this win lose game

start="1574.03" dur="5.04">there&apos;s a disincentive to kind of chill</text><text start="1576.67" dur="3.66">and wait for the safety things and</text><text start="1579.07" dur="3.03">something like climate change obviously</text><text start="1580.33" dur="3.18">is a an example of the that&apos;s like a</text><text start="1582.1" dur="2.14">perfect example the tragedy the Commons</text><text start="1583.51" dur="2.23">where you have</text><text start="1584.24" dur="2.79">it didn&apos;t matter that much at the</text><text start="1585.74" dur="2.46">beginning when we started the Industrial</text><text start="1587.03" dur="2.73">Revolution that we were pushing stuff</text><text start="1588.2" dur="4.71">into the atmosphere but as you say</text><text start="1589.76" dur="5.01">once it gets exponential then and we</text><text start="1592.91" dur="3.269">ignore that externality then we&apos;re in</text><text start="1594.77" dur="2.88">one of these multiple traps or no one&apos;s</text><text start="1596.179" dur="3.691">caring about the earth and then</text><text start="1597.65" dur="3.93">everybody gets screwed up so I agree</text><text start="1599.87" dur="3.24">with all that I also agree with you and</text><text start="1601.58" dur="3.51">saying this weaponization piece is a</text><text start="1603.11" dur="3.24">very interesting one it&apos;s and it takes</text><text start="1605.09" dur="2.58">it&apos;s weird mindset that we talked about</text><text start="1606.35" dur="3.72">a little bit before with this weird kind</text><text start="1607.67" dur="4.44">of Omni considerate mindset where you</text><text start="1610.07" dur="3.54">have to kind of this is both powerful</text><text start="1612.11" dur="3.69">from an individual perspective we tried</text><text start="1613.61" dur="3.69">like a steel man the other person but</text><text start="1615.8" dur="3.48">it&apos;s also very powerful from this kind</text><text start="1617.3" dur="4.74">of systems perspective we say hey if I</text><text start="1619.28" dur="4.14">do something and well maybe it&apos;s good</text><text start="1622.04" dur="3.75">for me but what happens if everybody</text><text start="1623.42" dur="4.23">does that you know then is it still good</text><text start="1625.79" dur="4.04">and is the thing that I&apos;m using the tool</text><text start="1627.65" dur="5.1">and I just did a podcast on new power</text><text start="1629.83" dur="4.69">these kinds of new power are those tools</text><text start="1632.75" dur="2.58">and those kinds of powerful things how</text><text start="1634.52" dur="3.36">are they going to be used by</text><text start="1635.33" dur="3.99">quote-unquote the other side you need to</text><text start="1637.88" dur="4.29">think about that in terms of this</text><text start="1639.32" dur="5.43">weaponization piece um so I agree with</text><text start="1642.17" dur="4.11">all of you here one thing that I might</text><text start="1644.75" dur="3.78">be worried about just as a heads up is</text><text start="1646.28" dur="3.779">like this to some extent I think that</text><text start="1648.53" dur="3.66">people might get stuck in a trap right</text><text start="1650.059" dur="4.051">now which is where I&apos;ll make maybe like</text><text start="1652.19" dur="4.23">a postmodernist trap where it&apos;s like you</text><text start="1654.11" dur="4.05">we had been in the the world of</text><text start="1656.42" dur="3.27">modernism we were excited by the world</text><text start="1658.16" dur="2.61">we said hey we&apos;re gonna be nationalists</text><text start="1659.69" dur="2.94">we&apos;re gonna go go go and then</text><text start="1660.77" dur="3.96">post-modernism came around and we</text><text start="1662.63" dur="4.049">rejected those myths we said no nothing</text><text start="1664.73" dur="5.01">can be real and like everything is kind</text><text start="1666.679" dur="4.651">of kind of gradients or whatever and it</text><text start="1669.74" dur="2.88">feels like it may be a similar thing</text><text start="1671.33" dur="3.599">here where you&apos;re like you say like oh</text><text start="1672.62" dur="3.87">man Reese we need to think about all the</text><text start="1674.929" dur="3.361">externalities all the time or like how</text><text start="1676.49" dur="4.5">many consideration all time or like how</text><text start="1678.29" dur="4.11">can we how can we then make choices if</text><text start="1680.99" dur="4.41">we have to be worried about the</text><text start="1682.4" dur="8.37">externalities kind of of everything yeah</text><text start="1685.4" dur="8.22">great question and as you can guess and</text><text start="1690.77" dur="4.32">what I&apos;m going to advocate is an</text><text start="1693.62" dur="5.15">adequate at the seeming and ethical</text><text start="1695.09" dur="5.73">framework is not post-modernism nice a</text><text start="1698.77" dur="7.06">couple more parts that we need to</text><text start="1700.82" dur="6.9">construct in here is so one thing</text><text start="1705.83" dur="3.87">regarding weaponization and just a very</text><text start="1707.72" dur="3.93">simple practical thought for people who</text><text start="1709.7" dur="4.14">are wanting to do good I was having this</text><text start="1711.65" dur="6.379">conversation with Tom Chi the other day</text><text start="1713.84" dur="6.9">and you know he&apos;s a really brilliant</text><text start="1718.029" dur="4.721">prototyper inventor robot assess</text><text start="1720.74" dur="3.659">technologists working on good things for</text><text start="1722.75"

think this is a</text><text start="1732.97" dur="4.87">approach that Bucky fuller laid out very</text><text start="1735.08" dur="4.829">clearly and and others have is let&apos;s</text><text start="1737.84" dur="4.23">take technology that already exists for</text><text start="1739.909" dur="4.65">weaponized purposes and start to</text><text start="1742.07" dur="3.78">popularize how to use it for actually</text><text start="1744.559" dur="3.391">positive purposes so we&apos;re not</text><text start="1745.85" dur="4.59">increasing the technological power</text><text start="1747.95" dur="5.31">landscape we&apos;re repurposing the shitty</text><text start="1750.44" dur="4.589">power to better power and so we aren&apos;t</text><text start="1753.26" dur="3.21">actually going to be driving a</text><text start="1755.029" dur="3.811">multipolar trapping race to the bottom</text><text start="1756.47" dur="4.049">we are within the current landscape of</text><text start="1758.84" dur="3.329">not having solved from multipolar traps</text><text start="1760.519" dur="4.29">categorically yet we&apos;re at least driving</text><text start="1762.169" dur="4.411">a race to the top and I think this is a</text><text start="1764.809" dur="3.541">really key idea so when he&apos;s looking at</text><text start="1766.58" dur="4.11">how do we take drone tech that already</text><text start="1768.35" dur="4.11">exists for military purposes and sucks</text><text start="1770.69" dur="3.69">we&apos;re not gonna make fundamentally</text><text start="1772.46" dur="4.679">better weapon izybelle drone tech but</text><text start="1774.38" dur="4.82">we&apos;re going to use it to plant a bunch</text><text start="1777.139" dur="4.77">of trees to pull a bunch of co2 out and</text><text start="1779.2" dur="5.829">stabilize topsoil and other things you</text><text start="1781.909" dur="6.9">have a much lower risk of weaponization</text><text start="1785.029" dur="6.87">in that approach and so I just want to</text><text start="1788.809" dur="4.681">offer that as one very simple kind of</text><text start="1791.899" dur="2.791">strategy that people can think about now</text><text start="1793.49" dur="2.789">that still doesn&apos;t mean that a</text><text start="1794.69" dur="3.0">particular approach won&apos;t have</text><text start="1796.279"

source of one X risk</text><text start="1885.309" dur="6.061">this is a generator function for all X</text><text start="1888.82" dur="5.07">risks because one things about it and so</text><text start="1891.37" dur="4.23">if we don&apos;t resolve it categorically</text><text start="1893.89" dur="5.669">then we just kind of move the timescales</text><text start="1895.6" dur="5.37">a tiny bit so let&apos;s take a tragedy of</text><text start="1899.559" dur="3.181">the Commons it started a long time ago</text><text start="1900.97" dur="4.41">and we just say okay we got a number of</text><text start="1902.74" dur="4.74">tribes that are all seeking to increase</text><text start="1905.38" dur="4.679">their own well-being they are in an</text><text start="1907.48" dur="4.829">implicit competition with each other for</text><text start="1910.059" dur="5.791">the same scarce resources at a certain</text><text start="1912.309" dur="6.211">point that implicit

dur="4.47">explicit militaristic competition which</text><text start="1921.85" dur="4.64">we can see how it happened but let&apos;s</text><text start="1924.34" dur="4.62">just even start to take first okay I</text><text start="1926.49" dur="4.09">don&apos;t want to cut all the trees down</text><text start="1928.96" dur="3.329">because I actually really like the</text><text start="1930.58" dur="4.14">forest I have a whole spirituality about</text><text start="1932.289" dur="3.811">our connection with nature and we need</text><text start="1934.72" dur="3.0">the force to live because that&apos;s where</text><text start="1936.1" dur="3.3">the animals live that we hunt and etc</text><text start="1937.72" dur="4.11">and I actually don&apos;t need that many</text><text start="1939.4" dur="4.59">trees I just need a few trees some only</text><text start="1941.83" dur="3.87">in cut down those few trees except the</text><text start="1943.99" dur="2.91">population of these other tribes and the</text><text start="1945.7" dur="2.609">total number of tribes has been</text><text start="1946.9" dur="3.57">increasing and they&apos;re all cutting down</text><text start="1948.309" dur="4.171">trees and so I know that if I don&apos;t cut</text><text start="1950.47" dur="3.24">down the trees it still doesn&apos;t ensure</text><text start="1952.48" dur="2.579">that there&apos;s a forest because the other</text><text start="1953.71" dur="2.76">guys didn&apos;t cut down the trees so</text><text start="1955.059" dur="3.631">there&apos;s not gonna be a forest anyways</text><text start="1956.47" dur="4.28">but he&apos;s actually my competitor because</text><text start="1958.69" dur="5.849">he&apos;s going to use those for weapons</text><text start="1960.75" dur="5.23">weapon making that if I don&apos;t also do so</text><text start="1964.539" dur="4.5">he will actually end up killing my</text><text start="1965.98" dur="4.62">people or people be able to outlive us</text><text start="1969.039" dur="3.75">through a famine because of total amount</text><text start="1970.6" dur="5.34">of economic accumulation or whatever it</text><text start="1972.789" dur="4.861">is so since I can&apos;t actually keep the</text><text start="1975.94" dur="3.66">forest because of those guys and even if</text><text start="1977.65" dur="3.269">I tried to make a truce with this one</text><text start="1979.6" dur="3.2">tribe there&apos;s this other tribe that we</text><text start="1980.919" dur="3.441">just can&apos;t even talk to</text><text start="1982.8" dur="3.87">so if anybody does the up thing</text><text start="1984.36" dur="4.44">of cutting down a bunch of trees then we</text><text start="1986.67" dur="3.36">are in a race to all get them first to</text><text start="1988.8" dur="3.06">keep the other guy from having them</text><text start="1990.03" dur="4.62">because there is no incentive and</text><text start="1991.86" dur="4.41">leaving them and because then it&apos;s best</text><text start="1994.65" dur="3.59">for us to have them so now we could have</text><text start="1996.27" dur="5.52">done a lot more trees than we need and</text><text start="1998.24" dur="4.96">so but they only do that because they&apos;re</text><text start="2001.79" dur="2.76">thinking the same thing about us where</text><text start="2003.2" dur="5.22">the up other tribe to them right</text><text start="2004.55" dur="6.54">and so now we all realize that we have</text><text start="2008.42" dur="4.47">to increase how good our axes and saws</text><text start="2011.09" dur="3.42">are and how many people are cutting down</text><text start="2012.89" dur="4.47">forests to cut it down faster because</text><text start="2014.51" dur="5.07">we&apos;re all racing to get that wood or the</text><text start="2017.36" dur="5.16">pigs or the whales or the farmland or</text><text start="2019.58" dur="5.1">whatever a dead trade and so now we are</text><text start="2022.52" dur="5.49">not just destroying the world upon which</text><text start="2024.68" dur="7.11">we depend we are in a race to destroy it</text><text start="2028.01" dur="5.13">as fast as possible and if we don&apos;t we</text><text start="2031.79" dur="2.94">assume it will still get destroyed and</text><text start="2033.14" dur="3.39">it will be worse for us and we have no</text><text start="2034.73" dur="4.62">chance of winning right so this is a</text><text start="2036.53" dur="5.13">scenario where anyone does the up</text><text start="2039.35" dur="5.31">thing and it sets a precedent for</text><text start="2041.66" dur="4.68">everyone else to actually be better off</text><text start="2044.66" dur="3.84">near-term if they do the up thing</text><text start="2046.34" dur="3.72">even though it leads to everyone being</text><text start="2048.5" dur="4.65">worse off over the long term so we have</text><text start="2050.06" dur="4.68">a decoupling of the incentive of each</text><text start="2053.15" dur="3.54">agent from the well-being of the other</text><text start="2054.74" dur="3.72">agents in the comments and as a result</text><text start="2056.69" dur="3.78">because of the interdependency of the</text><text start="2058.46" dur="3.54">commons we have a decoupling of our own</text><text start="2060.47" dur="5.19">short-term advantage with our own</text><text start="2062.0" dur="5.55">long-term well-being if I take the case</text><text start="2065.66" dur="3.66">of tragedy of the Commons we can see how</text><text start="2067.55" dur="3.54">recalcitrant and tricky those are if we</text><text start="2069.32" dur="4.08">take the case of an arms race we see the</text><text start="2071.09" dur="4.65">same thing and the tricky part here is</text><text start="2073.4" dur="3.93">we say ok we haven&apos;t succeeded with</text><text start="2075.74" dur="3.03">nuclear deep proliferation all that well</text><text start="2077.33" dur="5.58">all that we have is more and more</text><text start="2078.77" dur="5.88">countries having existential level power</text><text start="2082.91" dur="3.66">so we can&apos;t even have something like</text><text start="2084.65" dur="5.19">mutually assured destruction anymore and</text><text start="2086.57" dur="6.03">so an obviously exponential tech can</text><text start="2089.84" dur="4.5">make that non state level actors and not</text><text start="2092.6" dur="4.98">the increase of all types of dynamics</text><text start="2094.34" dur="6.81">but now let&apos;s take a current example</text><text start="2097.58" dur="7.17">let&apos;s take AI weapons right weaponized</text><text start="2101.15" dur="5.34">drones etc there is no general in the</text><text start="2104.75" dur="4.2">world that wants to live in the world</text><text start="2106.49" dur="4.86">where those weapons are robic waitis yep</text><text start="2108.95" dur="4.02">there&apos;s no military contractor military</text><text start="2111.35" dur="3.18">Hawk whatever who thinks that&apos;s actually</text><text start="2112.97" dur="3.09">a nicer world to

dur="4.29">us build the things and so it is</text><text start="2120.77" dur="3.93">a comprehensively worse world for all of</text><text start="2122.78" dur="4.29">us and our kids and our grandkids and</text><text start="2124.7" dur="4.89">yeah we&apos;re all gonna build the Miss fast</text><text start="2127.07" dur="3.9">as we can because the other guys</text><text start="2129.59" dur="2.46">going to build them and we say whoa okay</text><text start="2130.97" dur="2.91">no no we need to create an agreement</text><text start="2132.05" dur="4.29">their efforts being made to do this but</text><text start="2133.88" dur="4.56">all it has to happen is one guy doesn&apos;t</text><text start="2136.34" dur="3.42">one group doesn&apos;t join the agreement and</text><text start="2138.44" dur="2.67">now we don&apos;t want them to get the</text><text start="2139.76" dur="3.87">weaponized drones first so we got to do</text><text start="2141.11" dur="3.75">it or everybody joins the agreement but</text><text start="2143.63" dur="3.66">we&apos;re pretty sure they&apos;re gonna be</text><text start="2144.86" dur="4.02">defecting on it in secret right because</text><text start="2147.29" dur="3.15">they would have all of the incentive to</text><text start="2148.88" dur="3.81">do so so they keep the agreement and</text><text start="2150.44" dur="4.26">then in a black

dur="4.77">these kind of I agree that if we don&apos;t</text><text start="2379.36" dur="4.92">solve multipolar traps in these</text><text start="2381.76" dur="4.23">generator functions of X risk then we</text><text start="2384.28" dur="3.87">will self terminate I fully agree with</text><text start="2385.99" dur="3.39">that but the question is at what time</text><text start="2388.15"

of</text><text start="2402.73" dur="3.33">the X risks but then the generator</text><text start="2404.44" dur="3.99">functions kill us so how do you think</text><text start="2406.06" dur="3.96">about kind of the cost of delay there in</text><text start="2408.43" dur="7.47">terms of like what stuff we should focus</text><text start="2410.02" dur="7.68">on at which time if you are focusing

have to be focused on the generator</text><text start="2454.93" dur="4.86">functions because otherwise not only if</text><text start="2457.48" dur="3.81">we try and solve for a specific

that as</text><text start="2468.64" dur="4.02">we&apos;ve mentioned about goals before we</text><text start="2470.65" dur="5.52">actually solve it in a way that makes</text><text start="2472.66" dur="6.45">something else more likely and and this</text><text start="2476.17" dur="4.41">is why so when I said if we are trying</text><text start="2479.11" dur="2.94">to win at the game that is killing</text><text start="2480.58" dur="2.97">everything basically whenever I&apos;ve all</text><text start="2482.05" dur="2.82">this games and we&apos;re a sleeper in same</text><text

dur="3.71">I&apos;m doing that</text><text start="2518.37" dur="5.5">meaning I&apos;m creating dynamics where my</text><text start="2520.98" dur="4.87">ability to win is through better</text><text

dur="3.84">says within the kinds of systems we</text><text start="2565.87" dur="3.15">understand like capitalism we&apos;re going</text><text start="2567.82" dur="2.55">to move system dynamics in the right</text><text start="2569.02" dur="4.29">direction so one of the things people</text><text start="2570.37" dur="5.76">want to really focus on is is the source</text><text start="2573.31"

dur="3.21">will be focused on how do we actually</text><text start="2594.25" dur="4.29">solve the underlying generator functions</text><text start="2596.2" dur="4.32">and we spoke about the generator</text><text start="2598.54" dur="5.67">function from one perspective which is</text><text start="2600.52" dur="6.51">that rival risk dynamics cause harm and</text><text start="2604.21" dur="4.86">the exponential rivalry causing</text><text start="2607.03" dur="4.38">exponential harm self terminates yep</text><text start="2609.07" dur="3.93">there is another way of speaking about</text><text start="2611.41" dur="4.26">the generator function that is even more</text><text start="2613.0" dur="4.65">fundamental and abstract and I think it</text><text start="2615.67" dur="3.99">would be worth sharing that if because</text><text start="2617.65" dur="3.78">it speaks to what we have to change if</text><text start="2619.66" dur="3.54">your app let&apos;s yeah so then actually I</text><text start="2621.43" dur="3.09">was about to go there cuz I try we&apos;re</text><text start="2623.2" dur="2.94">essentially we&apos;re we&apos;re operating at the</text><text start="2624.52" dur="3.21">level of what I would call meta X risk</text><text start="2626.14" dur="2.97">the generator functions of X risk we</text><text start="2627.73" dur="3.78">pushed down for a bit there to the</text><text start="2629.11" dur="3.87">actual s X risks themselves and now</text><text start="2631.51" dur="3.18">let&apos;s go actually from one level of</text><text start="2632.98" dur="3.06">abstraction further up so tell me yeah</text><text start="2634.69" dur="2.7">what is the thing that</text><text start="2636.04" dur="3.93">is actually one level above these</text><text start="2637.39" dur="4.26">generator functions of X racing yeah so</text><text start="2639.97" dur="3.36">the one generator function we&apos;ve talked</text><text start="2641.65" dur="4.32">about rival resetting image we got that</text><text start="2643.33" dur="4.26">I want to give one other example of a</text><text start="2645.97" dur="5.09">generator function and then we&apos;ll go to</text><text start="2647.59" dur="5.94">an even more abstract unifying framework</text><text start="2651.06" dur="5.62">when you mention hey let&apos;s say we solve</text><text start="2653.53" dur="7.35">climate change is that adequate and is</text><text start="2656.68" dur="5.97">it even an appropriate thing to do so so</text><text start="2660.88" dur="5.58">let&apos;s take an example where we&apos;re not</text><text start="2662.65" dur="5.67">focused on like increasing war through</text><text start="2666.46" dur="3.42">exponential tech weaponization or</text><text start="2668.32" dur="6.18">whatever but we&apos;ll focused on simply</text><text start="2669.88" dur="7.29">environmental collapse dynamics so when</text><text start="2674.5" dur="4.68">we look at environmental damage dynamics</text><text start="2677.17" dur="5.52">all the environmental damage that we</text><text start="2679.18" dur="6.27">look at can be thought of in terms of</text><text start="2682.69" dur="6.06">either depletion of under noble</text><text start="2685.45" dur="4.98">resources or accumulation of waste</text><text start="2688.75" dur="5.7">streams that aren&apos;t being processed in</text><text start="2690.43" dur="6.54">real time and so accumulation and</text><text start="2694.45" dur="4.74">depletion when we start to look at the</text><text start="2696.97" dur="5.01">example so I say okay accumulation right</text><text start="2699.19" dur="5.16">what we call toxicity whether I&apos;m</text><text start="2701.98" dur="4.41">talking about nitrogen runoff causing</text><text

start="2740.62" dur="4.86">a bunch of co2 but I&apos;m not stopping the</text><text start="2743.5" dur="3.6">nitrogen runoff or the you know any of</text><text start="2745.48" dur="4.05">those other ones the biodiversity loss</text><text start="2747.1" dur="4.29">or whatever then what we&apos;ll find as I</text><text start="2749.53" dur="3.78">move the curve a tiny bit but I haven&apos;t</text><text start="2751.39" dur="3.87">addressed the fact that there are many</text><text start="2753.31" dur="3.51">many different metrics that are all</text><text start="2755.26" dur="3.39">moving to collapse from the same</text><text start="2756.82" dur="4.5">underlying dynamic similarly on the</text><text start="2758.65" dur="4.71">other side of depletion whether them</text><text start="2761.32" dur="3.75">talking about cutting down the</text><text start="2763.36" dur="4.14">old-growth forests or overfishing the</text><text start="2765.07" dur="4.23">ocean or species extinction of</text><text start="2767.5" dur="2.22">biodiversity loss or peak nitrogen</text><text start="2769.3" dur="2.94">turkey</text><text start="2769.72" dur="5.03">for us or any of those things those are</text><text start="2772.24" dur="5.43">all examples simile of unremovable</text><text start="2774.75" dur="5.62">resource utilization and an exponential</text><text start="2777.67" dur="4.44">curve on how that is happening so then</text><text start="2780.37" dur="4.47">we say let&apos;s put those both together and</text><text start="2782.11" dur="6.36">we look at that in a natural ecosystem</text><text start="2784.84" dur="5.07">like a forest there is no Unruh knowable</text><text start="2788.47" dur="3.51">use of resource and there is no</text><text start="2789.91" dur="3.78">accumulated waste every new thing is</text><text start="2791.98" dur="3.12">made from old things all the old things</text><text start="2793.69" dur="3.87">get turned into new things so you have</text><text start="2795.1" dur="5.16">comprehensive loop closure all the atoms</text><text start="2797.56" dur="4.08">are in closed loop atomic cycling so</text><text start="2800.26" dur="4.02">that the atoms from one thing when it</text><text start="2801.64" dur="5.37">dies become new things at the same speed</text><text start="2804.28" dur="5.64">that things are dying that or train ways</text><text start="2807.01" dur="5.85">the antifragility of nature is a</text><text start="2809.92" dur="5.58">function of a few things but primarily</text><text start="2812.86" dur="6.27">for this example a function of closed</text><text start="2815.5" dur="6.87">loop dynamics the fragility of the human</text><text start="2819.13" dur="6.62">bill world is largely a function of open</text><text start="2822.37" dur="5.88">loop dynamics so when we look at</text><text start="2825.75" dur="4.57">depletion on one side and accumulation</text><text start="2828.25" dur="5.19">on the other those are the two sides of</text><text start="2830.32" dur="8.16">a linear atomic economy or materials</text><text start="2833.44" dur="7.47">resource economy that we can say the</text><text start="2838.48" dur="4.56">underlying dynamic of linear flows</text><text start="2840.91" dur="3.78">rather than closed loop cycles or open</text><text start="2843.04" dur="3.69">loops and a network diagram is the way</text><text start="2844.69" dur="3.27">we define toxicity we&apos;re at large then</text><text start="2846.73" dur="3.83">we need to work on the generator</text><text start="2847.96" dur="5.28">function not of just this one specific</text><text start="2850.56" dur="4.86">accumulation or depletion issue but how</text><text start="2853.24" dur="4.59">do we have a process by which</text><text start="2855.42" dur="4.03">comprehensive loop closure is built into</text><text start="2857.83" dur="6.08">the choice making processes of all</text><text start="2859.45" dur="6.81">humans everywhere yep and as soon as we</text><text start="2863.91" dur="4.93">start thinking about it that way not</text><text start="2866.26" dur="5.33">just like how could we do it somewhere</text><text start="2868.84" dur="5.07">but how do we create a different type of</text><text start="2871.59" dur="3.67">behavioral dynamics from incentive</text><text start="2873.91" dur="2.94">structures to collective intelligence</text><text start="2875.26" dur="3.36">structures are basically the sense</text><text start="2876.85" dur="3.99">making and choice making dynamics that</text><text start="2878.62" dur="3.45">lead to all agents thinking about and</text><text start="2880.84" dur="3.57">working towards comprehensive loop</text><text start="2882.07" dur="4.89">closure that is now at a meta level to</text><text start="2884.41" dur="4.65">all of the specific instantiations so</text><text start="2886.96" dur="4.14">now we go one level deeper and we say we</text><text start="2889.06" dur="4.08">talked about rival risk dynamics</text><text start="2891.1" dur="4.47">multiplied by exponential tech self</text><text start="2893.14" dur="8.34">terminates we also talked about linear</text><text start="2895.57" dur="7.48">flows open loop flows on a finite planet</text><text start="2901.48" dur="3.97">also in the bleeding</text><text start="2903.05" dur="5.22">dynamic there is something that unifies</text><text start="2905.45" dur="5.58">both of those so we can flip them meta</text><text start="2908.27" dur="5.67">meta ex risk yep and we noticed that</text><text start="2911.03" dur="5.09">both of these involve specifically human</text><text start="2913.94" dur="8.28">and human choice empowered by technology</text><text start="2916.12" dur="10.66">in relationship with some kind of world</text><text start="2922.22" dur="6.21">or Commons right and so if I look at</text><text start="2926.78" dur="3.54">rival risk dynamics if there wasn&apos;t</text><text start="2928.43" dur="3.57">exponential tech if we stayed with stone</text><text start="2930.32" dur="4.32">tools we wouldn&apos;t really have any risk</text><text start="2932.0" dur="4.35">of self induced extinction we would just</text><text start="2934.64" dur="3.09">keep killing each other but we wouldn&apos;t</text><text start="2936.35" dur="2.55">kill everybody we couldn&apos;t have a war</text><text start="2937.73" dur="2.79">that killed everybody and we wouldn&apos;t be</text><text start="2938.9" dur="4.98">able to cut down all the treats right</text><text start="2940.52" dur="7.8">and so specifically it requires not just</text><text start="2943.88" dur="7.83">tech but ever-growing tech right tech</text><text start="2948.32" dur="6.6">feedback curves and similarly if our</text><text start="2951.71" dur="4.89">tools were limited to a size where like</text><text start="2954.92" dur="3.81">say we have just fishing lines not</text><text start="2956.6" dur="4.19">mile-long drift nets we wouldn&apos;t fish</text><text start="2958.73" dur="5.31">all the fish out of the ocean</text><text start="2960.79" dur="5.2">but as soon as we&apos;ve got mile-long drift</text><text start="2964.04" dur="3.72">nets and we&apos;ve got D nines taking down</text><text start="2965.99" dur="3.87">forests and slash-and-burn whatever else</text><text start="2967.76" dur="4.5">then again we start to see these</text><text start="2969.86" dur="3.93">fragility dynamics get larger than the</text><text start="2972.26" dur="3.57">playing field can handle because you&apos;ve</text><text start="2973.79" dur="5.04">got movements that are faster than the</text><text start="2975.83" dur="4.83">antifragility can process now we say why</text><text start="2978.83" dur="2.94">is that and here&apos;s the key insight for</text><text start="2980.66" dur="3.21">all the people that are thinking about</text><text start="2981.77" dur="4.59">how can we use the technology to make</text><text start="2983.87" dur="4.68">the world better and use technology in a</text><text start="2986.36" dur="4.26">fundamentally evolutionary way and the</text><text start="2988.55" dur="6.18">fact that people might say well look</text><text start="2990.62" dur="7.35">nature&apos;s rival risks and so we take</text><text start="2994.73" dur="5.49">market dynamics as kind of an example of</text><text start="2997.97" dur="3.39">a social darwinism of looking at how</text><text start="3000.22" dur="3.99">nature works and applying it to</text><text start="3001.36" dur="4.62">ourselves and am I talking about</text><text start="3004.21" dur="5.7">something that sounds like it is not how</text><text start="3005.98" dur="5.67">nature works well kind of yes and no and</text><text start="3009.91" dur="3.18">but there&apos;s this is really really</text><text start="3011.65" dur="2.85">critical because this is one place where</text><text start="3013.09" dur="2.67">people think they&apos;re thinking through</text><text start="3014.5" dur="9.03">formal systems but they&apos;re the wrong</text><text start="3015.76" dur="10.08">formal systems in nature pre humans</text><text start="3023.53" dur="6.78">let&apos;s say pre Homo habilis in the</text><text start="3025.84" dur="9.63">development of evolving technology or</text><text start="3030.31" dur="6.54">developing technology we see micro</text><text start="3035.47" dur="4.85">rivalry</text><text start="3036.85" dur="6.21">meaning this lion and this gazelle</text><text start="3040.32" dur="5.05">obviously in the moment of the chase</text><text start="3043.06" dur="3.78">have a rival risk

start="3048.58" dur="4.53">and they&apos;re kind of mutually exclusive</text><text start="3050.01" dur="4.53">so cool we we have a rival risk dynamic</text><text start="3053.11" dur="4.23">they&apos;re at a micro level and yet</text><text start="3054.54" dur="4.39">gazelles as a whole species and lions as</text><text start="3057.34" dur="4.56">a whole species depend upon each

dur="4.7">generation to the next so radically now</text><text start="3230.11" dur="5.01">why does this matter</text><text start="3232.35" dur="4.27">evolution and I know this is a bit of a</text><text start="3235.12" dur="2.73">long one but this is because this is</text><text start="3236.62" dur="4.31">actually the heart of the whole</text><text start="3237.85" dur="3.08">thing so thank you for indulging me</text><text start="3241.47" dur="4.42">evolution is a kind of creative process</text><text start="3244.33" dur="3.93">meaning it is a process by which new</text><text start="3245.89" dur="5.76">stuff comes to exist that didn&apos;t exist</text><text start="3248.26" dur="6.36">before and when we think about what the</text><text start="3251.65" dur="5.13">process of evolution is we have some</text><text start="3254.62" dur="4.38">kind of mutation and some kind of</text><text start="3256.78" dur="4.02">selection dynamics right so there is a</text><text start="3259.0" dur="3.3">distribution of things that are pretty</text><text start="3260.8" dur="3.6">similar but a little bit different and</text><text start="3262.3" dur="3.78">then the ones that are a little bit</text><text start="3264.4" dur="3.18">different in a slightly more adaptive</text><text start="3266.08" dur="4.8">way in the moment meaning can either</text><text start="3267.58" dur="4.38">survive or make better end up having a</text><text start="3270.88" dur="2.94">better chance of making it through</text><text start="3271.96" dur="6.12">whatever characteristics led to doing</text><text start="3273.82" dur="8.58">that get double down on etc so what we</text><text start="3278.08" dur="8.28">find is that that process happens</text><text start="3282.4" dur="6.03">extraordinarily slowly not by design</text><text start="3286.36" dur="3.69">it&apos;s an unconscious process right</text><text start="3288.43" dur="3.48">there&apos;s an unconscious process of</text><text start="3290.05" dur="3.96">mutation and an unconscious process of</text><text start="3291.91" dur="3.81">selection nobody is saying this one</text><text start="3294.01" dur="3.12">seems like a more truly and beautiful</text><text start="3295.72" dur="3.57">approach let&apos;s go with it this seems</text><text start="3297.13" dur="3.84">like a good future into perpetuity it&apos;s</text><text start="3299.29" dur="3.45">just these guys actually got food better</text><text start="3300.97" dur="3.03">or made it better and that&apos;s what gets</text><text start="3302.74" dur="3.27">elected for</text><text start="3304.0" dur="3.63">which can include selecting for things</text><text start="3306.01" dur="3.9">that move in the direction of increasing</text><text start="3307.63" dur="4.17">violence dominance capacity whatever but</text><text start="3309.91" dur="4.8">at least in nature one of the things</text><text start="3311.8" dur="4.59">that happens is that the rival risk</text><text start="3314.71" dur="4.5">dynamics where power is used in a</text><text start="3316.39" dur="5.22">rivalry sway in a micro context there is</text><text start="3319.21" dur="6.27">a coupling of there&apos;s a symmetrical</text><text start="3321.61" dur="7.23">coupling of the rates of power change so</text><text start="3325.48" dur="5.52">as a lion as lions are evolving to get</text><text start="3328.84" dur="4.08">to be better hunters over the course of</text><text start="3331.0" dur="4.67">hundreds or thousands of generations</text><text start="3332.92" dur="4.71">gazelles are also evolving to get faster</text><text start="3335.67" dur="3.31">because the gazelles that make it</text><text start="3337.63" dur="2.64">through are better getting away from the</text><text start="3338.98" dur="2.85">Lions and the lines that make it better</text><text start="3340.27" dur="3.57">getting the zealots right into there and</text><text start="3341.83" dur="4.02">their reproduction times are similar</text><text start="3343.84" dur="4.62">enough and they their system dynamics</text><text start="3345.85" dur="5.07">are embedded in or related so you don&apos;t</text><text start="3348.46" dur="5.18">get a symmetries of power you actually</text><text start="3350.92" dur="6.18">have a radical binding of power symmetry</text><text start="3353.64" dur="5.2">from lion - lion and from gazelle to</text><text start="3357.1" dur="3.3">gazelle and from lion to gazelle and</text><text start="3358.84" dur="4.49">from gazelle to plant and the whole</text><text start="3360.4" dur="5.64">thing right now this is key this is</text><text start="3363.33" dur="5.08">actually the essential criteria that</text><text start="3366.04" dur="5.04">makes micro rivalry lead to macro</text><text start="3368.41" dur="6.09">symbiosis is the symmetrical power</text><text start="3371.08" dur="6.15">binding imagine for a moment that I</text><text start="3374.5" dur="5.01">could make a mutation where Lions got a</text><text start="3377.23" dur="5.28">hundred times better at killing in one</text><text start="3379.51" dur="4.98">generation well in that one generation</text><text start="3382.51" dur="3.45">they would kill all the gazelles they&apos;d</text><text start="3384.49" dur="4.98">eat them all and then they would go</text><text start="3385.96" dur="5.73">extinct and so what we would find is</text><text start="3389.47" dur="6.24">that those species that were so much</text><text start="3391.69" dur="5.94">more effective than their environment</text><text start="3395.71" dur="3.9">could actually navigate in that crate</text><text start="3397.63" dur="3.69">resilience - would self terminate</text><text start="3399.61" dur="4.14">because of their own effectiveness in</text><text start="3401.32" dur="4.41">dependent upon of the ecological niche</text><text start="3403.75" dur="3.66">they depend upon they would be debasing</text><text start="3405.73" dur="4.62">the substrate upon which they depend</text><text start="3407.41" dur="5.28">through their over over expression and</text><text start="3410.35" dur="4.62">we see this virus happens virus comes</text><text start="3412.69" dur="4.38">about it is so lethal that it kills the</text><text start="3414.97" dur="4.77">host before it gets to I&apos;m actually</text><text start="3417.07" dur="4.62">propagate and then less virulent</text><text start="3419.74" dur="4.11">versions of that virus get to propagate</text><text start="3421.69" dur="3.57">more and nature actions of selecting for</text><text start="3423.85" dur="3.06">a virus that&apos;s moving more in the</text><text start="3425.26" dur="3.75">direction of symbiosis than just</text><text start="3426.91" dur="4.86">lethality right yes yeah and so</text><text start="3429.01" dur="4.14">evolution itself has this symmetrical</text><text start="3431.77" dur="3.61">power binding why this is so</text><text start="3433.15" dur="4.42">critical to understand is because</text><text start="3435.38" dur="3.78">nature does not select for individuals</text><text start="3437.57" dur="3.99">of a species and it doesn&apos;t even select</text><text start="3439.16" dur="4.98">for species it seems to over the very</text><text start="3441.56" dur="4.17">short term but as you zoom out over the</text><text start="3444.14" dur="5.28">long term it selects for</text><text start="3445.73" dur="7.62">self-stabilizing ecological niches where</text><text start="3449.42" dur="5.52">the particulars members of a species</text><text start="3453.35" dur="3.96">that seem like they&apos;re getting selected</text><text start="3454.94" dur="5.13">for over the short term that are super</text><text start="3457.31" dur="4.5">lethal over the long term self-terminate</text><text start="3460.07" dur="6.15">and so the things that make it through</text><text start="3461.81" dur="10.11">long term are these radically anti</text><text start="3466.22" dur="8.97">fragile symbiotic systems and so we said</text><text start="3471.92" dur="6.06">so okay we get that in nature and we we</text><text start="3475.19" dur="3.96">look at the most badass apex predators</text><text start="3477.98" dur="3.39">in nature whether we&apos;re looking at a</text><text start="3479.15" dur="5.52">lion or a shark or whatever and we look</text><text start="3481.37" dur="5.61">at a lion killing a gazelle compared to</text><text start="3484.67" dur="4.98">what a human factory farm of cows looks</text><text start="3486.98" dur="4.71">like right and we look at a shark eating</text><text start="3489.65" dur="5.88">a tuna compared to a mile long drift</text><text start="3491.69" dur="5.52">more if a mile long like if</text><text start="3495.53" dur="3.24">great whites got mile-long drift nets</text><text start="3497.21" dur="4.8">the whole ocean would have not existed a</text><text start="3498.77" dur="5.64">long time ago and so as soon as we</text><text start="3502.01" dur="5.46">developed technology and the ability to</text><text start="3504.41" dur="5.25">double down on technology we broke the</text><text start="3507.47" dur="3.87">power symmetry and we have to think</text><text start="3509.66" dur="3.18">about two applications humans with</text><text start="3511.34" dur="2.85">regard to other humans and humans with</text><text start="3512.84" dur="4.89">regard to the rest of nature that they</text><text start="3514.19" dur="6.78">depend upon so humans with regard to</text><text start="3517.73" dur="5.67">other humans the most powerful lion is</text><text start="3520.97" dur="4.11">not that much most powerful than then</text><text start="3523.4" dur="3.21">more powerful than the next most</text><text start="3525.08" dur="3.12">powerful lion and it&apos;s not even that</text><text start="3526.61" dur="4.38">much more powerful than the average lion</text><text start="3528.2" dur="4.8">or even one of the weaker lions if you</text><text start="3530.99" dur="8.28">think about it like the most powerful</text><text start="3533.0" dur="8.49">lion is maybe 1.1 or 1.2 X more powerful</text><text start="3539.27" dur="5.79">than that the upper incoming lion who</text><text start="3541.49" dur="5.31">will overtake him soon now look at human</text><text start="3545.06" dur="4.29">power distributions and say how much</text><text start="3546.8" dur="6.0">more destructive power does a Putin or a</text><text start="3549.35" dur="8.43">Trump have than you do a lot more</text><text start="3552.8" dur="6.57">dangerous crazy yeah like the ability to</text><text start="3557.78" dur="3.59">destroy the whole planet versus the</text><text start="3559.37" dur="6.41">ability to like maybe hit somebody right</text><text start="3561.37" dur="6.7">and maybe you can get a gun right and</text><text start="3565.78" dur="3.43">you look at here okay I don&apos;t know is</text><text start="3568.07" dur="3.54">that nine is that</text><text start="3569.21" dur="4.47">there&apos;s a magnitude it&apos;s a lot okay well</text><text start="3571.61" dur="5.88">that&apos;s a huge power asymmetry</text><text start="3573.68" dur="5.91">now humans with regard to nature we can</text><text start="3577.49" dur="4.11">cut down the forest much much much</text><text start="3579.59" dur="5.01">faster than forces forest can replenish</text><text start="3581.6" dur="4.89">we can use up resources faster than

dur="4.86">that&apos;s why the ohm den loop dynamics</text><text start="3591.53" dur="4.11">matter so much is because nature cannot</text><text start="3593.87" dur="5.03">actually process the speed

just gonna wrap up</text><text start="3897.579" dur="5.22">and then we&apos;ll kind of transition to a</text><text start="3900.03" dur="4.809">full wrap-up mode but as you said there</text><text start="3902.799" dur="4.111">first we have we&apos;ve already been talking</text><text start="3904.839" dur="5.671">about - did the generator functions of s</text><text start="3906.91"

dur="3.811">technology with interconnectedness leads</text><text start="3914.65" dur="3.84">to self-determination and you can think</text><text start="3916.93" dur="3.179">about the loop closures as another part</text><text start="3918.49" dur="3.599">of this where you have from a stock and</text><text start="3920.109" dur="3.541">flow perspective you have depletion or</text><text start="3922.089" dur="2.821">accumulation of various things and when</text><text start="3923.65" dur="3.0">those go to zero or in those two go to</text><text start="3924.91" dur="3.389">infinity that&apos;s also really bad for us</text><text start="3926.65" dur="3.78">so those two things our generator</text><text start="3928.299" dur="3.57">functions about extras but in fact as</text><text start="3930.43" dur="3.36">you&apos;re saying here there&apos;s one kind of</text><text start="3931.869" dur="3.541">one meta level above that which is to</text><text start="3933.79" dur="4.38">say that both of those things are the</text><text start="3935.41" dur="4.199">result of this new kind of process new</text><text start="3938.17" dur="3.27">technological process and that process</text><text start="3939.609" dur="3.45">is different than the evolutionary</text><text start="3941.44" dur="3.27">process and evolutionary process as you</text><text start="3943.059" dur="2.76">said is really good at taking if you</text><text start="3944.71" dur="2.76">think from a multi scale perspective</text><text start="3945.819" dur="4.351">it&apos;s really good at taking the micro</text><text start="3947.47" dur="6.0">rivalry and trends you know transforming</text><text start="3950.17" dur="5.879">it into macro you know symbiosis or anti</text><text start="3953.47" dur="4.41">fragility but technology does not do</text><text start="3956.049" dur="3.721">that technology does not have that micro</text><text start="3957.88" dur="3.81">to macro kind of thing and so we need to</text><text start="3959.77" dur="3.329">do is kind of think about the</text><text start="3961.69" dur="3.33">relationship between these two processes</text><text start="3963.099" dur="3.061">we&apos;ve created a new process aka</text><text start="3965.02" dur="1.559">technology and we&apos;ve had this whole</text><text start="3966.16" dur="1.86">process</text><text start="3966.579" dur="2.791">aka evolution we have to think</text><text start="3968.02" dur="3.39">what is the relationship between those</text><text start="3969.37" dur="4.41">things and how can we make a third kind</text><text start="3971.41" dur="4.32">of process that as you say is something</text><text start="3973.78" dur="4.19">kind of a combination of them that</text><text start="3975.73" dur="5.51">allows us to do the self designed</text><text start="3977.97" dur="6.22">bottom-up anti fragile creation</text><text start="3981.24" dur="4.63">so with that Daniel I know we&apos;re out of</text><text start="3984.19" dur="5.4">time here um and just for our listeners</text><text start="3985.87" dur="5.88">too as a quick note a you can go check</text><text start="3989.59" dur="5.19">out some of Daniels work at civilization</text><text start="3991.75" dur="4.59">emerging calm and I&apos;d recommend that</text><text start="3994.78" dur="3.48">because lots of the ideas here are there</text><text start="3996.34" dur="3.21">the other thing to note is that likely</text><text start="3998.26" dur="4.2">this will not be the last podcast</text><text start="3999.55" dur="4.8">between Daniel and I because you know he</text><text start="4002.46" dur="5.1">left it at a very juicy edge there which</text><text start="4004.35" dur="6.6">is what is the life we have science as</text><text start="4007.56" dur="4.68">their theory of kind of truth or</text><text start="4010.95" dur="2.85">whatever the world what is our theory of</text><text start="4012.24" dur="3.33">ethics in the world was there processed</text><text start="4013.8" dur="3.24">for that we need to dive into that we</text><text start="4015.57" dur="4.29">need to dive into how this relates to</text><text start="4017.04" dur="4.8">our current information revolution how</text><text start="4019.86" dur="3.63">this relates to black swans and the</text><text start="4021.84" dur="3.51">precautionary principle in progress and</text><text start="4023.49" dur="4.08">also what you as a person can do about</text><text start="4025.35" dur="3.78">all this uh-huh so well there&apos;ll be</text><text start="4027.57" dur="3.57">another one likely but Dana was there</text><text start="4029.13" dur="3.15">anything else that you would like to say</text><text start="4031.14" dur="2.88">to our listeners either a place that</text><text start="4032.28" dur="5.63">they can find you on the interwebs or or</text><text start="4034.02" dur="6.6">in the last thought that was a very</text><text start="4037.91" dur="6.25">concise and valuable wrap-up I</text><text start="4040.62" dur="5.96">appreciate it and yeah I&apos;m very happy to</text><text start="4044.16" dur="6.81">come back and take the next step because</text><text start="4046.58" dur="6.49">as you said we shared some frameworks</text><text start="4050.97" dur="3.87">without actually sharing the rest of the</text><text start="4053.07" dur="5.34">frameworks necessary to understand it or</text><text start="4054.84" dur="5.79">how to act with those frameworks so I&apos;m</text><text start="4058.41" dur="4.53">happy to come back and do that you</text><text start="4060.63" dur="3.93">already shared my blog so these topics</text><text start="4062.94" dur="3.0">are interesting to people I look forward</text><text start="4064.56" dur="3.53">to hearing questions thoughts that come</text><text start="4065.94" dur="2.15">up</text></transcript>
