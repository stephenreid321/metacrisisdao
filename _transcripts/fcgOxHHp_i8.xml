dur="3.92">and then through learning about the</text><text start="24.24" dur="5.76">sport becoming interested in the sport</text><text start="26.64" dur="7.04">because they care about one

issue</text><text start="52.079" dur="4.48">is because it&apos;s already terrain in the</text><text start="54.8" dur="3.919">culture war that they can</text><text start="56.559" dur="3.361">fight for

society in general</text><text start="79.04" dur="6.88">and other people and so</text><text start="82.72" dur="5.52">it&apos;s easy for me to be pessimistic about</text><text start="85.92" dur="6.239">the possibility of</text><text start="88.24" dur="6.64">finding a tech-based solution to</text><text start="92.159" dur="4.161">a problem that seems inherent in our</text><text start="94.88" dur="5.04">psychology</text><text start="96.32" dur="5.92">can you talk me out of that pessimism</text><text start="99.92" dur="5.44">the question you bring up is a kind of</text><text start="102.24" dur="7.04">real politic critique or question</text><text start="105.36" dur="5.68">of is human nature inexorably the thing</text><text start="109.28" dur="5.04">we&apos;re up against</text><text start="111.04" dur="5.439">uh so if you read machiavelli</text><text start="114.32" dur="4.0">reread the 48 laws of power or anything</text><text start="116.479" dur="5.201">that is kind of doing or</text><text start="118.32" dur="6.32">a real politic assessment of uh</text><text start="121.68" dur="4.479">patterns of human behavior historically</text><text start="124.64" dur="3.52">the argument can be made</text><text start="126.159" dur="3.841">that humans are intrinsically and maybe</text><text start="128.16" dur="3.12">there&apos;s a gaussian distribution based on</text><text start="130.0" dur="3.599">their genetics or their</text><text start="131.28" dur="4.16">whatever it is some something of how</text><text start="133.599" dur="3.921">much of this but that as a</text><text start="135.44" dur="3.519">the distribution as a whole humans are</text><text start="137.52" dur="6.16">either</text><text start="138.959" dur="7.841">innately too irrational or too rivalrous</text><text start="143.68" dur="4.88">or both to be able to have something</text><text start="146.8" dur="3.76">like</text><text start="148.56" dur="5.039">adequate sense making and adequate</text><text start="150.56" dur="6.88">integrative values to be able to have</text><text start="153.599" dur="6.161">an emergent order</text><text start="157.44" dur="4.079">and culture beyond an n group that is</text><text start="159.76" dur="3.839">unified against the now group</text><text start="161.519" dur="3.841">right that would be the the question</text><text start="163.599" dur="3.92">that we are kind of bound to</text><text start="165.36" dur="3.68">if there isn&apos;t a big enough out group we</text><text start="167.519" dur="4.08">will never be able to get the binding</text><text start="169.04" dur="4.72">energy we will go tribal on each other</text><text start="171.599" dur="3.201">and this is one of the arguments about</text><text start="173.76" dur="2.88">one of the things that happened in the</text><text start="174.8" dur="3.2">us obviously the u.s has had rivalry for</text><text start="176.64" dur="3.28">a long time the civil war was a good</text><text start="178.0" dur="4.72">example there&apos;d been plenty of examples</text><text start="179.92" dur="4.88">across partisanship or class or race or</text><text start="182.72" dur="4.239">region or</text><text start="184.8" dur="3.439">but um but we can also see that there</text><text start="186.959" dur="4.64">was a kind of</text><text start="188.239" dur="4.801">patriotism and reunification uh</text><text start="191.599" dur="3.36">associated with world war ii and for a</text><text start="193.04" dur="6.16">little while afterwards and</text><text start="194.959" dur="6.64">um and</text><text start="199.2" dur="4.319">when we look at the intensity of</text><text start="201.599" dur="6.0">partisanship in the u.s today</text><text start="203.519" dur="5.36">where even when i was a kid the</text><text start="207.599" dur="2.64">senators on the floor that would be</text><text start="208.879" dur="2.72">arguing with each other would go out to</text><text start="210.239" dur="2.881">lunch together afterwards and that</text><text start="211.599" dur="2.72">doesn&apos;t happen it&apos;s like what happened</text><text start="213.12" dur="2.479">in that time period</text><text start="214.319" dur="2.801">part of it has to do with the social</text><text start="215.599" dur="3.2">media thing part of it has to do with</text><text start="217.12" dur="2.24">things that occur in broadcast media</text><text start="218.799" dur="2.8">there&apos;s</text><text start="219.36" dur="3.68">there&apos;s a number of things one of the</text><text start="221.599" dur="3.36">arguments that many people brought up is</text><text start="223.04" dur="2.479">that it intensified after the soviet</text><text start="224.959" dur="2.961">union</text><text start="225.519" dur="4.401">collapsed and the wall came down in the</text><text start="227.92" dur="4.0">end of the cold war because the cold war</text><text start="229.92" dur="4.0">created a binding energy for the us to</text><text start="231.92" dur="2.879">all be on the same side adequately</text><text start="233.92" dur="3.36">against</text><text start="234.799" dur="4.321">a threatening enough external enemy and</text><text start="237.28" dur="3.92">that when it came down and china didn&apos;t</text><text start="239.12" dur="5.44">look anything like it does today</text><text start="241.2" dur="5.119">and they didn&apos;t have and russia didn&apos;t</text><text start="244.56" dur="2.16">even have putin yet organizing them in a</text><text start="246.319" dur="3.041">more</text><text start="246.72" dur="4.879">strategic way there wasn&apos;t a big enough</text><text start="249.36" dur="3.92">enemy to unify the us against itself</text><text start="251.599" dur="3.36">the u.s was the number one biggest force</text><text start="253.28" dur="2.4">and the number two number three biggest</text><text start="254.959" dur="2.4">force that</text><text start="255.68" dur="4.079">the left and right turned against each</text><text start="257.359" dur="5.441">other as the kind of largest source</text><text start="259.759" dur="5.841">of energy to extract um</text><text start="262.8" dur="4.32">or predatory advantage to incur and then</text><text start="265.6" dur="3.28">that has continued</text><text start="267.12" dur="3.2">as china has moved into a total</text><text start="268.88" dur="2.96">different position and</text><text start="270.32" dur="3.76">that&apos;s occurring in other parts of the</text><text start="271.84" dur="4.24">world</text><text start="274.08" dur="4.08">so there&apos;s this question of can people</text><text start="276.08" dur="4.32">be unified at a scale much larger than</text><text start="278.16" dur="6.0">tribal without an external enemy</text><text start="280.4" dur="5.12">or is that innate to us and we can see</text><text start="284.16" dur="4.319">jane goodall&apos;s</text><text start="285.52" dur="4.72">and jimmy carter&apos;s and martin luther</text><text start="288.479" dur="4.481">kings and carl sagans and people that</text><text start="290.24" dur="4.6">seem to have a more universal ethic</text><text start="292.96" dur="5.44">and there&apos;s a question of is that</text><text start="294.84" dur="6.04">conditionable across a population widely</text><text start="298.4" dur="4.4">or those people naturally outliers for</text><text start="300.88" dur="2.879">some reason will always be outliers and</text><text start="302.8" dur="2.8">the trying to</text><text start="303.759" dur="4.961">think about conditioning qualities like</text><text start="305.6" dur="3.12">that more widely is</text><text start="308.84" dur="4.04">falling um</text><text start="313.759" dur="3.921">eric weinstein and i had a conversation</text><text start="316.0" dur="3.039">a couple years ago on his podcast and</text><text start="317.68" dur="1.84">this was like the heart of the thing</text><text start="319.039" dur="2.481">that we</text><text start="319.52" dur="6.399">talked about because he and i had a</text><text start="321.52" dur="6.959">fairly similar assessment of the</text><text start="325.919" dur="5.12">catastrophic risk landscape that</text><text start="328.479" dur="4.241">exponential tech under current kinds of</text><text start="331.039" dur="3.521">rivalrous and irrational governance</text><text start="332.72" dur="4.88">creates and</text><text start="334.56" dur="4.88">we each had a thought on how to</text><text start="337.6" dur="3.28">overcome that and they were different</text><text start="339.44" dur="3.84">and he made a</text><text start="340.88" dur="3.36">a joke that was fun and he&apos;s like well i</text><text start="343.28" dur="2.8">think your</text><text start="344.24" dur="3.12">solution requires changing human nature</text><text start="346.08" dur="2.959">but i&apos;ll indulge you on that because</text><text start="347.36" dur="2.72">mine requires breaking the speed of</text><text start="349.039" dur="4.16">light</text><text start="350.08" dur="6.08">um and his solution was</text><text start="353.199" dur="4.641">no i i think we are too rivalrous we</text><text start="356.16" dur="3.52">have to be able to have</text><text start="357.84" dur="3.52">civilizations work that have some</text><text start="359.68" dur="3.12">intrinsically shared value base if</text><text start="361.36" dur="2.8">they&apos;re too close to someone else that</text><text start="362.8" dur="2.16">doesn&apos;t have enough shared value base</text><text start="364.16" dur="2.56">they won&apos;t</text><text start="364.96" dur="3.04">care and if they they will end up</text><text start="366.72" dur="2.4">wanting the other one&apos;s resource at a</text><text start="368.0" dur="2.8">certain point</text><text start="369.12" dur="3.28">so we need to be able to inhabit planets</text><text start="370.8" dur="4.88">that are far enough apart that war</text><text start="372.4" dur="6.72">war is unfeasible and like you can see</text><text start="375.68" dur="4.639">how someone smart thinking well about</text><text start="379.12" dur="2.24">these things could be like well maybe</text><text start="380.319" dur="4.401">that&apos;s the case right</text><text start="381.36" dur="5.6">maybe that is actually a necessary thing</text><text start="384.72" dur="3.44">and i don&apos;t know if my sense of it is</text><text start="386.96" dur="3.2">will end up being right because</text><text start="388.16" dur="3.2">obviously we don&apos;t</text><text start="390.16" dur="2.4">we don&apos;t have the basis to be able to</text><text start="391.36" dur="4.48">say that much certainty but i&apos;ll tell</text><text start="392.56" dur="3.28">you why i think it is</text><text start="397.44" dur="3.44">one of the post-modern critiques of</text><text start="398.96" dur="5.92">modernity that was right</text><text start="400.88" dur="6.4">is that the idea that there is</text><text start="404.88" dur="3.28">an unbiased objective assessment of the</text><text start="407.28" dur="4.16">world is</text><text start="408.16" dur="6.879">uh is dangerous</text><text start="411.44" dur="5.599">that when we&apos;re doing um because</text><text start="415.039" dur="3.44">in a complex situation which things i</text><text start="417.039" dur="2.961">picked to measure</text><text start="418.479" dur="2.881">even if i&apos;m measuring and repeating</text><text start="420.0" dur="2.72">measurement and getting it right and not</text><text start="421.36" dur="3.839">messing that up anywhere</text><text start="422.72" dur="3.919">just by cherry-picking out of the data</text><text start="425.199" dur="2.961">of a very large set or even cherry</text><text start="426.639" dur="2.721">picking what i do the science to measure</text><text start="428.16" dur="3.039">on i can get</text><text start="429.36" dur="3.36">something that is quote-unquote true but</text><text start="431.199" dur="3.28">not representative and then</text><text start="432.72" dur="4.08">argue as if it&apos;s representative or</text><text start="434.479" dur="5.44">decontextualize the facts or</text><text start="436.8" dur="3.76">um or lakehoff frame the interpretation</text><text start="439.919" dur="2.321">that there&apos;s a</text><text start="440.56" dur="3.759">pragmatics in addition to the kind of</text><text start="442.24" dur="4.0">semantics and that</text><text start="444.319" dur="3.121">we can see this more in the social</text><text start="446.24" dur="2.64">sciences where there&apos;s increased</text><text start="447.44" dur="5.52">complexity with the</text><text start="448.88" dur="5.12">whole early social science in the us of</text><text start="452.96" dur="4.079">why</text><text start="454.0" dur="3.52">uh why blacks were a genetically lower</text><text start="457.039" dur="2.321">race</text><text start="457.52" dur="3.44">than the us unless the declaration of</text><text start="459.36" dur="3.52">independence didn&apos;t pertain to them and</text><text start="460.96" dur="4.16">yet we weren&apos;t morally corrupt</text><text start="462.88" dur="4.08">or the science of phrenology or things</text><text start="465.12" dur="5.359">like that and be like</text><text start="466.96" dur="7.44">yeah that was that was</text><text start="470.479" dur="5.921">just political vested interest gibberish</text><text start="474.4" dur="4.4">guiding itself in something that sounded</text><text start="476.4" dur="3.6">sciencey and it&apos;s not anything like real</text><text start="478.8" dur="4.72">objective</text><text start="480.0" dur="4.479">science well i think the answer isn&apos;t</text><text start="483.52" dur="2.799">you throughout science</text><text start="484.479" dur="3.12">and say that there is no way to come to</text><text start="486.319" dur="3.201">truth because if that&apos;s the case</text><text start="487.599" dur="3.521">all there is is power and then we&apos;re</text><text start="489.52" dur="3.2">actually stuck in that thing</text><text start="491.12" dur="3.04">we need to just correct for it so we</text><text start="492.72" dur="3.599">don&apos;t say that</text><text start="494.16" dur="3.52">anyone can be unbiased but we say we can</text><text start="496.319" dur="2.961">seek bias correction</text><text start="497.68" dur="3.199">we can seek to be able to take all of</text><text start="499.28" dur="3.199">the perspectives well not just</text><text start="500.879" dur="2.801">performatively but really seek to</text><text start="502.479" dur="3.041">inhabit them</text><text start="503.68" dur="4.88">and then seek to identify where there&apos;s</text><text start="505.52" dur="5.2">true signal and seek to synthesize them</text><text start="508.56" dur="3.199">and so is it possible to do bias</text><text start="510.72" dur="3.04">correction better</text><text start="511.759" dur="3.921">towards shared sense making that never</text><text start="513.76" dur="6.24">has a hundred percent confidence but an</text><text start="515.68" dur="8.159">increasingly well epistemically grounded</text><text start="520.0" dur="5.519">confidence so the reason i say this is</text><text start="523.839" dur="3.44">because a lot of the social science that</text><text start="525.519" dur="4.561">we have</text><text start="527.279" dur="3.361">uh i think is problematic in this way i</text><text start="530.08" dur="4.16">think it&apos;s</text><text start="530.64" dur="5.52">after um the thing called</text><text start="534.24" dur="3.44">empire and then even the thing called</text><text start="536.16" dur="2.72">industrial revolution and capitalism had</text><text start="537.68" dur="2.88">taken over</text><text start="538.88" dur="4.639">which was not the evolutionary history</text><text start="540.56" dur="6.48">of humans in mostly tribal environments</text><text start="543.519" dur="4.801">and there it created a source of</text><text start="547.04" dur="2.88">conditioning but it was fairly</text><text start="548.32" dur="3.12">ubiquitous conditioning and since it was</text><text start="549.92" dur="3.52">ubiquitous we just said oh</text><text start="551.44" dur="3.68">this is human nature and then where we</text><text start="553.44" dur="2.88">would see something like an indigenous</text><text start="555.12" dur="8.719">tribe that was different it could be</text><text start="556.32"
