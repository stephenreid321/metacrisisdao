a</text><text start="6.359" dur="4.021">property that&apos;s actually essential to</text><text start="8.7" dur="3.72">understand the nature of the universe we</text><text start="10.38" dur="4.2">live in and it&apos;s actually essential to</text><text start="12.42" dur="4.38">understand what it means to be human</text><text start="14.58" dur="5.16">and it is essential for understanding</text><text start="16.8" dur="5.58">the basis for meaning for ethics for</text><text start="19.74" dur="5.34">existentialism and then also what that</text><text start="22.38" dur="5.28">portends for the future of

dur="4.26">start by defining</text><text start="34.079" dur="4.5">what is emergence emergence means</text><text start="36.78" dur="3.42">something new arises that wasn&apos;t here</text><text start="38.579" dur="4.261">before right we all kind of have that</text><text start="40.2" dur="4.379">sense intuitively but scientifically how</text><text start="42.84" dur="4.379">the does that happen how do you</text><text start="44.579" dur="4.98">bring particles or planets or anything</text><text start="47.219" dur="3.781">together and all of a sudden the hole</text><text start="49.559" dur="4.621">has some properties that none of the</text><text start="51.0" dur="6.42">parts had like where do they come from</text><text start="54.18" dur="4.98">emergence is a result of synergy synergy</text><text start="57.42" dur="3.42">is a result of relationship</text><text start="59.16" dur="4.02">and relationship is a result of</text><text start="60.84" dur="3.899">attractive forces</text><text start="63.18" dur="3.06">there are some kinds of attractive</text><text start="64.739" dur="3.06">forces whether it&apos;s gravity bringing</text><text start="66.24" dur="3.419">dust together into planets or planets</text><text start="67.799" dur="4.021">together into solar systems whether it&apos;s</text><text start="69.659" dur="3.901">electromagnetism bringing

start="82.02" dur="4.32">whether it&apos;s bringing these people</text><text start="83.04" dur="5.219">together via pheromones or love or</text><text start="86.34" dur="3.36">intellectual Affinity or a topic that</text><text start="88.259" dur="3.781">we&apos;re all interested in like creating a</text><text start="89.7" dur="4.02">better world which is that it&apos;s actually</text><text start="92.04" dur="3.78">attraction driving the whole</text><text start="93.72" dur="4.859">evolutionary story right attraction</text><text start="95.82" dur="4.56">driving relationship driving Synergy</text><text start="98.579" dur="4.561">driving new emergent properties driving</text><text start="100.38" dur="3.72">net novelty and new creation and the era</text><text start="103.14" dur="3.6">of evolution so we can actually</text><text start="104.1" dur="4.62">understand the arrow of evolution itself</text><text start="106.74" dur="3.239">in terms of this set of phenomena</text><text start="108.72" dur="3.24">together</text><text start="109.979" dur="3.78">it&apos;s also the case that if you bring the</text><text start="111.96" dur="3.06">same thing together a bunch of the same</text><text start="113.759" dur="3.18">thing you don&apos;t get very interesting</text><text start="115.02" dur="3.0">synergies you get very interesting</text><text start="116.939" dur="2.161">synergies when you bring different</text><text start="118.02" dur="3.48">things with different properties</text><text start="119.1" dur="3.9">together in the right format where then</text><text start="121.5" dur="2.88">you have the properties of each of those</text><text start="123.0" dur="2.88">things and then the properties of the</text><text start="124.38" dur="3.86">relationship between those which is the</text><text start="125.88" dur="2.36">new stuff</text><text start="128.78" dur="3.099">things can come together all kinds of</text><text start="130.86" dur="3.36">ways but the ones that come together</text><text start="131.879" dur="4.08">most synergistically offer and confer</text><text start="134.22" dur="3.56">the most advantage in Universe selects</text><text start="135.959" dur="5.28">for it so universe is actually selecting</text><text start="137.78" dur="6.34">for more differences right so it&apos;s</text><text start="141.239" dur="4.801">selecting for diversity and then more</text><text start="144.12" dur="4.199">synergistic combinations across those</text><text start="146.04" dur="4.559">differences that and it&apos;s both of those</text><text start="148.319" dur="5.101">more diversity and more unification</text><text start="150.599" dur="5.821">across the diversity right more agency</text><text start="153.42" dur="5.16">and more symbiosis at the same time is</text><text start="156.42" dur="4.74">what defines the era of evolution</text><text start="158.58" dur="4.56">right so like a cell you can think of as</text><text start="161.16" dur="4.14">having its own agency right its own</text><text start="163.14" dur="4.26">ability to act and its own boundary and</text><text start="165.3" dur="4.5">periphery but you bring a bunch of cells</text><text start="167.4" dur="4.619">together and this collection of cells</text><text start="169.8" dur="3.659">can reflect on Consciousness and</text><text start="172.019" dur="3.36">existentialism and have a conversation</text><text start="173.459" dur="3.78">like this even though none of those</text><text start="175.379" dur="3.241">cells on their own do that</text><text start="177.239" dur="4.741">right</text><text start="178.62" dur="5.52">and it&apos;s different kinds of cells</text><text start="181.98" dur="4.32">it takes neurons and glial cells and</text><text start="184.14" dur="4.92">immune cells and stem cells Etc to all</text><text start="186.3" dur="4.799">come together so more agency more</text><text start="189.06" dur="4.02">differentiation more orderly</text><text start="191.099" dur="3.901">relationship more Synergy all of that</text><text start="193.08" dur="5.04">comes together in the net defining thing</text><text start="195.0" dur="5.34">is emergence how much fundamental new</text><text start="198.12" dur="4.86">Advantage arises and that&apos;s what</text><text start="200.34" dur="5.52">evolution selects for and with that</text><text start="202.98" dur="4.8">story on the physical you also have the</text><text start="205.86" dur="4.14">evolution of Consciousness structures</text><text start="207.78" dur="3.72">themselves right as you move from a</text><text start="210.0" dur="2.819">reptilian nervous system to the</text><text start="211.5" dur="2.94">increased orderly complexity of a</text><text start="212.819" dur="3.42">mammalian and then a neocortical and</text><text start="214.44" dur="3.9">then a prefrontal nervous system you</text><text start="216.239" dur="3.601">move from the kinds of sentients that</text><text start="218.34" dur="3.899">map to that of pain pleasure at</text><text start="219.84" dur="4.92">reptilian to emotional to cognition to</text><text start="222.239" dur="4.381">abstraction so we have a universe that&apos;s</text><text start="224.76" dur="3.839">moving in the direction of not only more</text><text start="226.62" dur="4.92">Elegance but greater depths and breadth</text><text start="228.599" dur="5.521">of Consciousness itself</text><text start="231.54" dur="4.38">now this defines an era of evolution</text><text start="234.12" dur="3.6">that reifies meaning in a very</text><text start="235.92" dur="3.72">interesting way and one of the things</text><text start="237.72" dur="3.96">that&apos;s so interesting is with our</text><text start="239.64" dur="4.2">capacity for abstraction we cannot just</text><text start="241.68" dur="3.36">think about our experiential self of the</text><text start="243.84" dur="2.7">moment but we can think about ourselves</text><text start="245.04" dur="3.96">in abstract terms we can think about</text><text start="246.54" dur="5.279">time abstractly deep past and deep</text><text start="249.0" dur="4.68">future right and that is what allows us</text><text start="251.819" dur="3.84">to actually understand Evolution itself</text><text start="253.68" dur="4.019">it&apos;s an understanding of deep past and</text><text start="255.659" dur="4.021">fossil record and astrophysics they give</text><text start="257.699" dur="5.101">us a sense of the ability to abstract</text><text start="259.68" dur="5.16">laws of how that change occurs over time</text><text start="262.8" dur="3.839">that allows us a deeper insight as to</text><text start="264.84" dur="3.78">how we got here and then also the</text><text start="266.639" dur="3.661">ability to Vision a future fundamentally</text><text start="268.62" dur="3.66">more beautiful and more interesting and</text><text start="270.3" dur="4.5">then be part of that creative process so</text><text start="272.28" dur="4.859">if we learn how to use it well then we</text><text start="274.8" dur="5.1">say how can we learn from the past how</text><text start="277.139" dur="6.0">Universe Works to be able to imagine a</text><text start="279.9" dur="4.2">future in an omni-considerate way that</text><text start="283.139" dur="3.181">is</text><text start="284.1" dur="3.84">has fundamentally less suffering and</text><text start="286.32" dur="3.18">higher quality of life across all</text><text start="287.94" dur="3.06">meaningful quality of life metrics for</text><text start="289.5" dur="3.12">all life right that is Omni</text><text start="291.0" dur="3.6">considerately true good and beautiful</text><text start="292.62" dur="3.48">and then how can we apply all that</text><text start="294.6" dur="3.9">learning now to actually help create</text><text start="296.1" dur="4.319">that world and in doing so we stop just</text><text start="298.5" dur="3.54">being a part of the whole</text><text start="300.419" dur="3.06">but in our ability to think about the</text><text start="302.04" dur="2.7">whole and think about the direction of</text><text start="303.479" dur="3.0">the whole we can actually become an</text><text start="304.74" dur="3.84">agent for the whole</text><text start="306.479" dur="4.261">this is huge right the bee is</text><text start="308.58" dur="3.42">serving this huge role in evolution by</text><text start="310.74" dur="3.06">pollinating the plants that make the</text><text start="312.0" dur="2.82">atmosphere that make us but they don&apos;t</text><text start="313.8" dur="2.399">know they&apos;re doing that and they can&apos;t</text><text start="314.82" dur="3.06">consciously figure out how to do it</text><text start="316.199" dur="3.181">better but we actually have the</text><text start="317.88" dur="4.62">capability of looking at what the whole</text><text start="319.38" dur="5.4">story is and identifying as well the</text><text start="322.5" dur="4.74">whole evolutionary impulse of universe</text><text start="324.78" dur="4.68">brought me about and then woke up to</text><text start="327.24" dur="4.019">itself in me and so we moved from</text><text start="329.46" dur="4.5">Evolution as a mostly unconscious</text><text start="331.259" dur="6.121">algorithmic process that selects for</text><text start="333.96" dur="5.519">dominance now to a process that can be</text><text start="337.38" dur="3.9">mediated by conscious agents</text><text start="339.479" dur="3.361">they can actually forecast a more</text><text start="341.28" dur="4.1">beautiful future and select to help</text><text start="342.84" dur="2.54">create that</text><text start="345.919" dur="6.34">when we don&apos;t identify as evolutionaries</text><text start="349.74" dur="5.22">then we can be actually kind of we</text><text start="352.259" dur="4.5">identify as nouns rather than verbs</text><text start="354.96" dur="3.6">and we stay stuck where we&apos;re at and</text><text start="356.759" dur="3.301">then we need pain as an evolutionary</text><text start="358.56" dur="3.359">driver and then emergence through</text><text start="360.06" dur="3.66">emergency is how we grow</text><text start="361.919" dur="4.5">as soon as we identify with the</text><text start="363.72" dur="5.039">inexorability of evolution and ourselves</text><text start="366.419" dur="3.72">as Evolution incarnate we stop needing</text><text start="368.759" dur="3.841">pain to push us because our whole</text><text start="370.139" dur="4.441"> purpose for being for becoming</text><text start="372.6" dur="4.26">being becoming or actually matched</text><text start="374.58" dur="4.559">they&apos;re two sides of the same thing is</text><text start="376.86" dur="4.38">the lure of the becoming is the bringing</text><text start="379.139" dur="4.081">about more of the Timeless properties of</text><text start="381.24" dur="3.36">the infinite in time right more of the</text><text start="383.22" dur="2.819">infinite through the finite this</text><text start="384.6" dur="3.599">actually becomes the basis of our</text><text start="386.039" dur="4.261">existence and everybody knows that when</text><text start="388.199" dur="4.44">you are in the experience of creating</text><text start="390.3" dur="4.08">beauty that didn&apos;t exist before in</text><text start="392.639" dur="3.84">universe that adds to Universe it&apos;s</text><text start="394.38" dur="3.42">uniquely years to create you

that the emptiness</text><text start="402.84" dur="4.919">causes all kinds of addiction</text><text start="405.479" dur="4.201">right because that&apos;s fundamental to what</text><text start="407.759" dur="4.44">we&apos;re actually here to do now when we</text><text start="409.68" dur="6.0">all identify as evolutionaries we</text><text start="412.199" dur="6.481">obsolete the need as pain for a driver</text><text start="415.68" dur="4.98">when we also identify as fundamentally</text><text start="418.68" dur="4.2">interconnected parts</text><text start="420.66" dur="4.14">of a

start="426.78" dur="4.139">self that isn&apos;t a definition of success</text><text start="428.34" dur="4.56">for the whole and we stop thinking that</text><text start="430.919" dur="3.0">the idea of advantaging ourselves at the</text><text start="432.9" dur="2.76">expense of something else we&apos;re</text><text start="433.919" dur="2.641">inexorably interconnected to make sense</text><text start="435.66" dur="3.599">at all</text><text start="436.56" dur="4.079">when Einstein said the idea that there</text><text start="439.259" dur="4.141">are separate things is an optical</text><text start="440.639" dur="6.241">delusion of consciousness</text><text start="443.4" dur="5.6">and in reality there is one reality that</text><text start="446.88" dur="6.0">we call Universe of which we are all</text><text start="449.0" dur="6.52">inextricably interconnected facets</text><text start="452.88" dur="4.259">and your experience of self is a facet</text><text start="455.52" dur="3.959">of that now what&apos;s so</text><text start="457.139" dur="4.081">fascinating is that it is interconnected</text><text start="459.479" dur="3.241">with all of it it&apos;s an expression of the</text><text

dur="3.961">civilization where everyone actually</text><text start="476.36" dur="4.54">identifies this way</text><text start="478.44" dur="4.86">as a emergent property of the whole as</text><text

dur="4.44">Humanity actually becomes a thing it</text><text start="494.16" dur="4.02">actually becomes an emergent property</text><text start="496.38" dur="3.539">right now it&apos;s an idea but we

more</text><text start="524.52" dur="3.66">and more significant rates and you can</text><text start="526.74" dur="3.0">cherry pick metrics where things are</text><text start="528.18"

also true</text><text start="535.44" dur="3.06">then that doesn&apos;t mean things are</text><text start="537.0" dur="4.92">getting better or worse it means the</text><text start="538.5"
