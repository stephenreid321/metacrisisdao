dur="4.02">of that for example this is a good case</text><text start="286.45" dur="3.03">study one of the things they ended up</text><text start="288.25" dur="2.7">getting a hold it was the notion that</text><text start="289.48" dur="3.18">you could actually do things when you</text><text start="290.95" dur="4.14">could imagine what the consequences of</text><text start="292.66" dur="4.44">your actions might be quite a distance</text><text start="295.09" dur="3.84">down the road and you could actually</text><text start="297.1" dur="3.27">really really good at that to the point</text><text start="298.93" dur="3.45">you could actually sit there and hear</text><text start="300.37" dur="3.63">someone to describe a plan to you and</text><text start="302.38" dur="4.83">you could listen to the plan and go that</text><text start="304.0" dur="4.5">won&apos;t work right and be very confident</text><text start="307.21" dur="3.81">that in fact that plan is not a good</text><text start="308.5" dur="4.38">plan I mean an example might be I&apos;m</text><text start="311.02" dur="4.29">going to walk up to the fireplace and</text><text start="312.88" dur="3.51">point my hands I didn&apos;t say light I&apos;ll</text><text start="315.31" dur="2.94">say well you know that&apos;s not gonna work</text><text start="316.39" dur="3.0">I&apos;ve got a good model of how reality</text><text start="318.25" dur="3.45">works I&apos;ve done this sort of thing</text><text start="319.39" dur="4.98">before bad plan alright so what I found</text><text start="321.7" dur="4.14">though was that as I absorb more and</text><text start="324.37" dur="3.299">more life experience and more and more</text><text start="325.84" dur="4.2">knowledge I began to be noticed that</text><text start="327.669" dur="4.621">more and more often more and more</text><text start="330.04" dur="4.17">people&apos;s plans were of that sort</text><text start="332.29" dur="3.45">and that was like well that&apos;s</text><text start="334.21" dur="3.72">interesting so I took that as an object</text><text start="335.74" dur="5.58">of inquiry and by the way again my own</text><text start="337.93" dur="5.13">being first and foremost so okay [ __ ]</text><text start="341.32" dur="4.11">long-term planning is not working out so</text><text start="343.06" dur="5.76">I got you know kept going okay how can</text><text start="345.43" dur="4.83">you actually make effective choices how</text><text start="348.82" dur="2.61">can you actually plan at all</text><text start="350.26" dur="4.68">about what&apos;s gonna happen in the future</text><text start="351.43" dur="6.9">and what I began to notice was the stuff</text><text start="354.94" dur="5.22">we&apos;ve been talking about like everything</text><text start="358.33" dur="4.44">that we currently believe that we can</text><text start="360.16" dur="3.87">plan won&apos;t work like none of the stuff</text><text start="362.77" dur="3.3">that we have in our tool kit that allows</text><text start="364.03" dur="3.87">us to make plans for the future is gonna</text><text start="366.07" dur="3.36">work out fill in the blank like pick any</text><text start="367.9" dur="2.64">problem I kept running the situations</text><text start="369.43" dur="3.57">when people describe a particular</text><text start="370.54" dur="4.47">problem everything we&apos;re gonna solve</text><text start="373.0" dur="3.55">climate we&apos;re gonna solve conflict we&apos;re</text><text start="375.01" dur="2.77">gonna solve education</text><text start="376.55" dur="2.64">just listen to them talk about their</text><text start="377.78" dur="3.03">plan and go well that&apos;s not gonna work</text><text start="379.19" dur="4.47">only is that not gonna work it&apos;s gonna</text><text start="380.81" dur="4.53">work like terribly what&apos;s happening so</text><text start="383.66" dur="5.31">this led me to then finally looking at</text><text start="385.34" dur="5.16">it okay what might and then that began</text><text start="388.97" dur="3.66">the process of saying okay how do we</text><text start="390.5" dur="7.71">actually get to the point we can begin</text><text start="392.63" dur="11.33">to get some level of clarity on what</text><text start="398.21" dur="8.97">might actually be a meaningful step and</text><text start="403.96" dur="5.44">that leads me here that this is the</text><text start="407.18" dur="6.48">answer to that question the answer of</text><text start="409.4" dur="6.51">recognizing that the question of sense</text><text start="413.66" dur="7.86">making together is ultimately a question</text><text start="415.91" dur="9.06">of how do I make better choices and how</text><text start="421.52" dur="5.94">do I and you become a we who make better</text><text start="424.97" dur="4.17">choices hopefully in some context that</text><text start="427.46" dur="3.54">builds to us collectively actually being</text><text start="429.14" dur="3.36">able to make the kinds of better choices</text><text start="431.0" dur="3.12">that are truly responsive to the</text><text start="432.5" dur="3.18">environment we find ourselves in like</text><text start="434.12" dur="4.01">it&apos;s just sort of the first step of that</text><text start="435.68"

what we&apos;ve talked about it&apos;s</text><text start="459.669" dur="6.661">like that thing that happened somewhere</text><text start="461.47" dur="6.15">around the Paleolithic transition the</text><text start="466.33" dur="3.119">Upper Paleolithic transition where</text><text start="467.62" dur="5.46">humans suddenly kicked into something</text><text start="469.449" dur="5.581">that

just</text><text start="725.5" dur="3.84">defining a place it&apos;s a pointer to</text><text start="727.39" dur="3.63">something over here so like a wool what</text><text start="729.34" dur="3.27">is that the first thing is the reason</text><text start="731.02" dur="2.67">why we can name it game B is to say</text><text start="732.61" dur="3.24">what&apos;s something that is in fact a</text><text start="733.69" dur="4.23">different game altogether all right so</text><text start="735.85" dur="4.35">go over to the basis it&apos;s something on</text><text start="737.92" dur="7.05">the order of

start="748.03" dur="4.71">that has happened in civilization since</text><text start="749.41" dur="5.7">then that whole box is different right</text><text start="752.74" dur="3.78">that order of magnitude and it has</text><text start="755.11" dur="5.31">characteristics that allow it to</text><text start="756.52" dur="6.36">actually actually address these three</text><text start="760.42" dur="4.38">questions and their complexity natural</text><text start="762.88" dur="3.45">complexity and the problematic of</text><text start="764.8" dur="3.24">exponential technology that comes from</text><text start="766.33" dur="3.15">learning it&apos;s okay</text><text start="768.04" dur="3.39">what does that look like what are some</text><text start="769.48" dur="2.79">characteristics of that and that&apos;s some</text><text start="771.43" dur="4.17">of the things we&apos;ve been talking about</text><text start="772.27" dur="5.4">today at the center of it for me at</text><text start="775.6" dur="3.72">least as I&apos;ve gone through the</text><text start="777.67" dur="3.09">questioning of this over and over and</text><text start="779.32" dur="3.24">over again it recognized for example</text><text start="780.76" dur="3.18">that you have to change the mind</text><text start="782.56" dur="5.1">otherwise you just recapitulate this</text><text start="783.94" dur="5.94">society is this thing we&apos;ve been calling</text><text start="787.66" dur="4.32">coherent collective intelligence and</text><text start="789.88" dur="7.32">coherence specifically is that the very</text><text start="791.98" dur="6.66">center of it but in many ways game be</text><text start="797.2" dur="4.8">even talked about has a bit of that</text><text start="798.64" dur="5.85">Taoist sense to it as you&apos;re naming it</text><text start="802.0" dur="4.65">in the context of game a quite often</text><text start="804.49" dur="3.57">you&apos;re actually importing gaming into it</text><text start="806.65" dur="3.51">so you have to actually treat it very</text><text start="808.06" dur="3.54">very carefully it&apos;s less about being</text><text start="810.16" dur="4.17">able to describe it than it is in fact</text><text start="811.6" dur="4.74">just being able to do it it is the kind</text><text start="814.33" dur="4.35">of thing that you do not the kind of</text><text start="816.34" dur="4.41">thing you talk about you can talk about</text><text start="818.68" dur="4.11">how you can become capable of it but</text><text start="820.75" dur="3.96">designing it talking about it is</text><text start="822.79" dur="2.7">generally a full fundamental error that</text><text start="824.71" dur="2.93">does that make sense what I&apos;m saying</text><text start="825.49" dur="2.15">there</text><text start="828.52" dur="8.64">I mean I think just depends on how</text><text start="831.85" dur="6.81">taoist we imagine game B to be well</text><text start="837.16" dur="3.75">that&apos;s very odd because you can&apos;t</text><text start="838.66" dur="4.56">actually be Taoist interesting enough</text><text start="840.91" dur="4.26">but it can actually be it&apos;s more like</text><text start="843.22" dur="4.74">the Taoist insight that points to the</text><text start="845.17" dur="4.5">Dao I can say very clearly if I could</text><text start="847.96" dur="4.08">articulate it my definition is</text><text start="849.67" dur="3.9">complicated it&apos;s not complicated game B</text><text start="852.04" dur="5.22">is not complicated game B must be</text><text start="853.57" dur="6.26">intrinsically complex so I cannot define</text><text start="857.26" dur="4.55">it in any finite set of statements</text><text start="859.83" dur="5.35">because any finite set of statements</text><text start="861.81" dur="5.65">it&apos;s complicated so it&apos;s not that kind</text><text start="865.18" dur="4.38">of thing so if I&apos;m explaining as I&apos;m</text><text start="867.46" dur="4.2">describing it I have to be doing it in</text><text start="869.56" dur="4.68">something which is essentially poetic</text><text start="871.66" dur="4.77">not a specification or where as daniel</text><text start="874.24" dur="4.05">said I&apos;m pointing towards the generator</text><text start="876.43" dur="6.11">functions they give rise to something</text><text start="878.29" dur="4.25">that is more than the thing that is said</text><text start="883.32" dur="8.59">noticing three distinct things to come</text><text start="885.52" dur="8.34">up one is the question of why why did</text><text start="891.91" dur="4.82">this thing which I&apos;ll just call</text><text start="893.86" dur="11.6">coherence that we&apos;ve been talking about</text><text start="896.73" dur="14.56">the the second is why does it thus far</text><text start="905.46" dur="10.99">fail to scale and then of course the</text><text start="911.29" dur="7.35">third is how might we do about solving</text><text start="916.45" dur="5.07">that problem all three seem to be</text><text start="918.64" dur="5.79">showing up close to each other in my</text><text start="921.52" dur="5.43">sense do you want to share more what you</text><text start="924.43" dur="6.57">mean by coherence all right immediately</text><text start="926.95" dur="5.49">what comes up so what is this thing and</text><text start="931.0" dur="2.79">there&apos;s a lot of different ways of</text><text start="932.44" dur="5.88">talking about it but we might say</text><text start="933.79" dur="6.33">there&apos;s ah actually interesting it seems</text><text start="938.32" dur="4.14">like you actually have to talk about it</text><text start="940.12" dur="5.84">in many different ways because it is the</text><text start="942.46" dur="8.37">kind of thing that cannot be conveyed</text><text start="945.96" dur="7.36">effectively in language you know it&apos;s</text><text start="950.83" dur="5.31">the matrix unfortunately no one can be</text><text start="953.32" dur="4.23">told what coherence is but we can&apos;t</text><text start="956.14" dur="3.99">actually tell a lot of different stories</text><text start="957.55" dur="4.469">it&apos;s become the blonde with the elephant</text><text start="960.13" dur="4.079">and after a little while we</text><text start="962.019" dur="4.8">might be able to in ourselves grass</text><text start="964.209" dur="11.73">perhaps what is being pointed out so one</text><text start="966.819" dur="12.06">way of describing it is it is a it&apos;s a</text><text start="975.939" dur="11.45">form of collective intelligence that has</text><text start="978.879" dur="16.01">as a characteristic a high degree of</text><text start="987.389" dur="15.1">capacity in the space of novelty and a</text><text start="994.889" dur="10.75">intrinsic antifragility in both human</text><text start="1002.489" dur="9.44">and throw Powe complexity and nature</text><text start="1005.639" dur="9.12">complexity another way of saying that is</text><text start="1011.929" dur="4.06">if you work backwards in taking a look</text><text start="1014.759" dur="4.95">at all the different challenges and</text><text start="1015.989" dur="8.881">problems that we are currently facing we</text><text start="1019.709" dur="11.73">meaning humanity is the answer to the</text><text start="1024.87" dur="10.89">set that contains those problems another</text><text start="1031.439" dur="7.071">way of describing it is it&apos;s something</text><text start="1035.76" dur="6.679">like flow since we have that as a nice</text><text start="1038.51" dur="10.81">concrete frame then we can invoke that</text><text start="1042.439" dur="8.59">in an unconstrained way ie we oftentimes</text><text start="1049.32" dur="3.989">associate with flow with flow in a</text><text start="1051.029" dur="5.61">domain a rock-climber isn&apos;t flowing</text><text start="1053.309" dur="8.75">climbing rocks a jazz band isn&apos;t flow</text><text start="1056.639" dur="8.611">and playing jazz coherence is flow</text><text start="1062.059" dur="8.041">absent context absent a particular</text><text start="1065.25" dur="7.669">application you know so</text><text start="1070.1" dur="8.31">mentioned he said it has a relationship</text><text start="1072.919" dur="6.991">with novelty what prompts you to put</text><text start="1078.41" dur="3.899">that into the mix because if I just hear</text><text start="1079.91" dur="4.2">the word coherent so that just feels let</text><text start="1082.309" dur="3.841">you know from physics electronics</text><text start="1084.11" dur="4.59">whatever it would just be things in some</text><text start="1086.15" dur="6.269">form of sync with each other but you</text><text start="1088.7" dur="6.57">added in novelty and antifragility the</text><text start="1092.419" dur="3.721">brothers have seemed interesting but</text><text start="1095.27" dur="3.87">they&apos;re not what I would have just</text><text start="1096.14" dur="7.56">expected to come from the word so can</text><text start="1099.14" dur="9.029">you help unpack either the Y or the how</text><text start="1103.7" dur="7.05">you got to those yeah I think also to</text><text start="1108.169" dur="5.691">begin it&apos;s I think what you bring up is</text><text start="1110.75" dur="4.89">good we should just say that there&apos;s</text><text start="1113.86" dur="5.86">different kinds of collective</text><text start="1115.64" dur="5.789">intelligence and some kinds of</text><text start="1119.72" dur="2.91">collective intelligence we have</text><text start="1121.429" dur="2.581">different names for with my call them</text><text start="1122.63" dur="4.62">different things so in this context</text><text start="1124.01" dur="5.909">we&apos;re going to have to be very familiar</text><text start="1127.25" dur="4.44">with the notion that word choice is</text><text start="1129.919" dur="4.831">oftentimes going to require some careful</text><text start="1131.69" dur="4.2">definition as you just did so let&apos;s just</text><text start="1134.75" dur="3.39">for everyone who&apos;s listening just</text><text start="1135.89" dur="4.14">recognize that oftentimes I have a</text><text start="1138.14" dur="3.57">certain vocabulary daniel has vocabulary</text><text start="1140.03" dur="3.72">you have a vocabulary we&apos;re all</text><text start="1141.71" dur="4.89">operating under what I&apos;ve called rule</text><text start="1143.75" dur="4.73">Omega which is listen to what is being</text><text start="1146.6" dur="4.11">expressed not what is being said and</text><text start="1148.48" dur="3.76">asked good questions until what is being</text><text start="1150.71" dur="4.92">expressed has actually felt it&apos;s landed</text><text start="1152.24" dur="6.96">so if we think about the examples of</text><text start="1155.63" dur="5.669">flow you&apos;ve provided so well one of the</text><text start="1159.2" dur="4.349">things that shows up so commonly is a</text><text start="1161.299" dur="5.521">sense of there being an emergence or a</text><text start="1163.549" dur="5.161">synergy where there&apos;s something about a</text><text start="1166.82" dur="5.64">hole that is greater than the sum of the</text><text start="1168.71" dur="11.0">parts and that as it turns out happens</text><text start="1172.46" dur="7.25">to be the best way to respond to novelty</text><text start="1181.15" dur="5.88">let me add some words that I think might</text><text start="1185.02" dur="6.98">add clarity to a question I hear you</text><text start="1187.03" dur="7.43">asking we&apos;ve discussed offline some</text><text start="1192.0" dur="5.53">different types of coherence in</text><text start="1194.46" dur="4.78">different contexts and like formal</text><text start="1197.53" dur="4.32">models for looking at what coherence in</text><text start="1199.24" dur="4.92">different contexts means and so when you</text><text start="1201.85" dur="2.94">mention like physics like things of the</text><text start="1204.16" dur="3.77">same type</text><text start="1204.79" dur="6.24">like pendulums or lasers that&apos;s a</text><text start="1207.93" dur="4.09">coherence of sameness they all become</text><text start="1211.03" dur="5.91">the same wavelength</text><text start="1212.02" dur="7.17">they have the same periodicity and when</text><text start="1216.94" dur="5.27">we&apos;re talking about humans being able to</text><text start="1219.19" dur="7.5">come into coherence we&apos;re not wanting a</text><text start="1222.21" dur="6.73">homogenizing coherence and if you think</text><text start="1226.69" dur="4.89">about something like a body liver cells</text><text start="1228.94" dur="4.74">and neurons and fat cells are all very</text><text start="1231.58" dur="4.05">different types of cells and yet they&apos;re</text><text start="1233.68" dur="4.38">operating in a way where the body is an</text><text start="1235.63" dur="4.17">emergent property that has capacities</text><text start="1238.06" dur="4.35">that none of the cells or organs or</text><text start="1239.8" dur="4.29">subsystems they can separately have so</text><text start="1242.41" dur="3.99">it&apos;s a coherence of different things</text><text start="1244.09" dur="4.38">where the difference is the basis of</text><text start="1246.4" dur="6.03">synergy rather than being the basis of</text><text start="1248.47" dur="7.41">an unreconciled or conflict the</text><text start="1252.43" dur="5.37">difference is a basis for synergy where</text><text start="1255.88" dur="3.27">each of them have capacity separately</text><text start="1257.8" dur="3.21">and then the whole has capacities</text><text start="1259.15" dur="6.12">neither of them have that are found in</text><text start="1261.01" dur="6.51">each of them plus the relationships as</text><text start="1265.27" dur="4.41">opposed to the differences being a basis</text><text start="1267.52" dur="3.84">for unreconciled will conflict so we&apos;re</text><text start="1269.68" dur="6.63">interested here in the types of</text><text start="1271.36" dur="6.62">coherence that can occur where there are</text><text start="1276.31" dur="4.53">differences right differences of</text><text start="1277.98" dur="6.4">experience differences of perspective</text><text start="1280.84" dur="5.61">and yet like so I&apos;ll just tie a couple</text><text start="1284.38" dur="4.23">other words together Jordan said he said</text><text start="1286.45" dur="4.05">it&apos;s kind of like flow if we think of</text><text start="1288.61" dur="4.52">flow from fluid dynamics in terms of</text><text start="1290.5" dur="6.51">like laminar flow versus turbulent flow</text><text start="1293.13" dur="5.86">there&apos;s a more flow is less entropy and</text><text start="1297.01" dur="5.13">actually not just less entropy buts</text><text start="1298.99" dur="5.34">entropy the movement towards holes that</text><text start="1302.14" dur="3.84">have greater than some of the parts and</text><text start="1304.33" dur="3.69">so I think that&apos;s what we&apos;re really</text><text start="1305.98" dur="4.53">interested in collective sense making is</text><text start="1308.02" dur="5.73">how do we come together in relationship</text><text start="1310.51" dur="6.21">that has less friction less entropy</text><text start="1313.75" dur="6.48">relationally Moore&apos;s entropy where the</text><text start="1316.72" dur="5.1">group of us has capacities has emergent</text><text start="1320.23" dur="5.85">properties that aren&apos;t found in any of</text><text start="1321.82" dur="7.05">us in isolation the coherence is that</text><text start="1326.08" dur="5.52">phenomena that emergent properties arise</text><text start="1328.87" dur="5.28">from right and then so the the other</text><text start="1331.6" dur="8.19">distinction was we&apos;ve got we&apos;ve got</text><text start="1334.15" dur="7.8">examples of this kind that have no we&apos;re</text><text start="1339.79" dur="3.18">actually gonna get pretty nuanced so we</text><text start="1341.95" dur="2.91">may as well just be careful about the</text><text start="1342.97" dur="4.11">were getting nuanced we have a</text><text start="1344.86" dur="4.08">particular kind of coherence I&apos;m just</text><text start="1347.08" dur="5.13">gonna label coordination just we have a</text><text start="1348.94" dur="5.28">label for it and this has a lot of weird</text><text start="1352.21" dur="4.29">Angels talking about in fact it has</text><text start="1354.22" dur="5.339">emergent properties so for example if</text><text start="1356.5" dur="5.82">you&apos;ve got a mathematician having a</text><text start="1359.559" dur="7.141">conversation with an economist there&apos;s</text><text

there&apos;s a connection</text><text start="1370.059" dur="3.901">between those two ways of thinking the</text><text start="1372.0" dur="3.28">toolkits of mathematics that&apos;s not</text><text

dur="5.491">to that that&apos;s also not the thing we&apos;re</text><text start="1389.38" dur="4.919">talking about that&apos;s awesome</text><text start="1390.91" dur="5.69">really good useful but for very specific</text><text start="1394.299" dur="5.841">reasons which we can go to if we&apos;d like</text><text start="1396.6" dur="10.42">it doesn&apos;t actually have the capacity to</text><text

dur="4.83">differentiator between what you were</text><text start="1676.17" dur="4.5">describing is coherence and simply maybe</text><text start="1678.72" dur="4.41">collective intelligence or

dur="2.841">traditional societies they might have</text><text start="1833.57" dur="3.44">some wild-ass crazy ritual</text><text start="1834.88" dur="3.21">well like you know Haitian Vodou

dur="3.03">stuff well interestingly I think we</text><text start="1876.13" dur="6.9">actually have a nice self referentiality</text><text start="1877.51" dur="6.9">that just happens right here because so</text><text start="1883.03" dur="4.05">the first step might be something like</text><text start="1884.41" dur="3.87">something I call a paradigm mapping and</text><text start="1887.08" dur="3.03">Daniel actually did paradigm that many</text><text start="1888.28" dur="4.37">moment ago so you take a particular</text><text start="1890.11" dur="6.15">story that somebody&apos;s telling and you</text><text start="1892.65" dur="5.11">point by point map it to a particular</text><text start="1896.26" dur="3.9">paradigm so I could describe that in</text><text start="1897.76" dur="3.84">terms of cognitive science and say okay</text><text start="1900.16" dur="5.07">what&apos;s really happening is that when we</text><text start="1901.6" dur="6.96">create a proposition that there&apos;s a</text><text start="1905.23" dur="5.31">third what this does in our own minds is</text><text start="1908.56" dur="3.75">that it allows us to no longer have an</text><text start="1910.54" dur="3.87">emotional attachment to the rightness or</text><text start="1912.31" dur="4.62">the wrongness a particular idea which</text><text start="1914.41" dur="4.29">gives rise to a cognitive capacity to be</text><text start="1916.93" dur="4.89">more creative more fluid in explorations</text><text start="1918.7" dur="6.09">and therefore is a more generative way</text><text start="1921.82" dur="4.95">it&apos;s a it&apos;s a form of hack that allows</text><text start="1924.79" dur="4.74">us to have that cognitive disposition</text><text start="1926.77" dur="4.47">right so I just did a mapping to a kind</text><text start="1929.53" dur="3.66">of language in cognitive science that</text><text start="1931.24" dur="3.99">would take somebody who loads and runs</text><text start="1933.19" dur="3.81">cognitive science as a sense making</text><text start="1935.23" dur="3.78">framework and make them go okay that</text><text start="1937.0" dur="3.45">makes sense feels good my I don&apos;t feel</text><text start="1939.01" dur="2.91">scared or angry about what&apos;s happening</text><text start="1940.45" dur="5.1">right now that feels like a feasible</text><text start="1941.92" dur="6.39">thing but of course the meta proposition</text><text start="1945.55" dur="7.8">is that mapping it to a paradigm full</text><text start="1948.31" dur="7.17">stop at all is the problem so anytime</text><text start="1953.35" dur="3.69">you&apos;re actually trying to make sense by</text><text start="1955.48" dur="5.13">mapping to a paradigm whether the</text><text start="1957.04" dur="6.03">paradigm is a you know Vishnu or the God</text><text start="1960.61" dur="6.87">pan or cognitive neuroscience or</text><text start="1963.07" dur="5.54">whatever you&apos;re already

that</text><text start="3302.32" dur="5.49">synthesis emerging</text><text start="3304.68" dur="4.45">beats me man I mean I feel like to your</text><text start="3307.81" dur="3.12">point a little bit

start="3321.4" dur="7.02">it feels like there needs I mean as as</text><text start="3326.28" dur="4.03">like I hear what you&apos;re saying from the</text><text start="3328.42" dur="4.2">kind of

these glimpses of</text><text start="3357.81" dur="6.73">something more shared between us that</text><text start="3360.73" dur="5.97">continually seem to unspool and you know</text><text start="3364.54" dur="4.1">and here&apos;s a few that I&apos;ve seen I mean I</text><text start="3366.7" dur="4.98">think the key thing is to recognize that</text><text start="3368.64" dur="4.54">obviously we don&apos;t know how because</text><text start="3371.68" dur="6.93">otherwise we already would have and</text><text start="3373.18" dur="7.68">that&apos;s crucial it&apos;s

start="3382.27" dur="3.78">important to keep putting it out there</text><text start="3383.17" dur="5.76">and my sense is at least my own personal</text><text start="3386.05" dur="5.19">experience is that it&apos;s becoming more</text><text start="3388.93" dur="4.08">clear like I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;ve been</text><text start="3391.24" dur="3.3">wandering in the desert coming back

I&apos;ll give you some examples of things</text><text start="3397.42" dur="9.45">that seem to be more right than wrong so</text><text start="3402.49" dur="6.42">one is let&apos;s just take the

putting it</text><text start="3478.83" dur="7.44">okay and then we go season now I&apos;ve got</text><text start="3483.6" dur="5.25">some thoughts on how to do that</text><text start="3486.27" dur="4.41">synthesis you said that was one of the</text><text start="3488.85" dur="4.71">distinctions no I think this this useful</text><text start="3490.68" dur="5.28">thing of saying hey here&apos;s the here&apos;s</text><text start="3493.56" dur="5.13">the stuff I found and you know most of</text><text start="3495.96" dur="4.92">it has been a disaster but there&apos;s a few</text><text start="3498.69" dur="4.62">that actually kind of work so it&apos;s this</text><text start="3500.88" dur="7.26">let&apos;s see what else we got okay so</text><text start="3503.31" dur="6.84">here&apos;s a few we talked about coherence</text><text start="3508.14" dur="5.55">of difference rather than coherence of</text><text start="3510.15" dur="7.26">sameness like heterogeneous coherence</text><text start="3513.69" dur="6.0">correct so when you&apos;re talking about the</text><text start="3517.41" dur="4.11">subordination of the individual versus</text><text start="3519.69" dur="4.76">individuality there&apos;s something having</text><text start="3521.52" dur="5.46">to do with that there is a</text><text start="3524.45" dur="4.39">meaningfulness and a beauty and a</text><text start="3526.98" dur="4.22">dignity of the individual that we don&apos;t</text><text start="3528.84" dur="4.11">want to subordinate in some kind of</text><text start="3531.2" dur="4.24">homogenizing way we don&apos;t want to</text><text start="3532.95" dur="3.54">decrease the diversity that leads to the</text><text start="3535.44" dur="3.9">resilience of life</text><text start="3536.49" dur="5.67">right and then the richness of it a my</text><text start="3539.34" dur="4.74">own discernment and choice making even</text><text start="3542.16" dur="3.99">as I&apos;m part of a collective that feels</text><text start="3544.08" dur="6.27">really important right and then</text><text start="3546.15" dur="6.3">simultaneously there are kinds of</text><text start="3550.35" dur="3.53">diversity and difference that only lead</text><text start="3552.45" dur="4.349">to</text><text start="3553.88" dur="5.02">unreconciled bol entropic conflicts and</text><text start="3556.799" dur="5.31">so those are not interesting kinds of</text><text start="3558.9" dur="5.549">diversity and so we want as much</text><text start="3562.109" dur="6.69">diversity as we can create synergy</text><text start="3564.449" dur="6.54">across we get maximum synergy from</text><text start="3568.799" dur="5.04">maximum diversity with maximum parallax</text><text start="3570.989" dur="5.04">so now think about for a moment with the</text><text start="3573.839" dur="4.47">idea of parallax and just just to find</text><text start="3576.029" dur="5.82">that if it was like so parallax in terms</text><text start="3578.309" dur="5.7">of the way the two eyes neither eye has</text><text start="3581.849" dur="5.25">depth perception or peripheral vision</text><text start="3584.009" dur="6.09">right and when I have both eyes together</text><text start="3587.099" dur="4.23">they they have a lot of shared things</text><text start="3590.099" dur="2.61">that they see but because they&apos;re in</text><text start="3591.329" dur="3.12">different locations they also have</text><text start="3592.709" dur="3.721">slightly different things that they see</text><text start="3594.449" dur="3.931">so there&apos;s overlap a difference right</text><text start="3596.43" dur="3.569">and this is important so when I put the</text><text start="3598.38" dur="2.729">two together they&apos;re not competing for</text><text start="3599.999" dur="4.35">which one is right that would be</text><text start="3601.109" dur="4.89">ridiculous right they&apos;re actually the</text><text start="3604.349" dur="3.24">optical cortex is putting the</text><text start="3605.999" dur="3.09">information together in a way where if</text><text start="3607.589" dur="3.0">there&apos;s actually an error in this one</text><text start="3609.089" dur="3.71">it&apos;s corrected by what this one&apos;s doing</text><text start="3610.589" dur="5.49">so they error correct each other and</text><text start="3612.799" dur="5.29">then because I can compute the</text><text start="3616.079" dur="4.74">hypotenuse of the triangle I actually</text><text start="3618.089" dur="4.86">get depth perception and periphery so</text><text start="3620.819" dur="3.841">the two eyes together give things that</text><text start="3622.949" dur="4.35">neither of them did separately plus</text><text start="3624.66" dur="4.23">aircraft shape so I want them to have</text><text start="3627.299" dur="2.76">some shared reality and I want them to</text><text start="3628.89" dur="2.639">find their shared reality but I also</text><text start="3630.059" dur="3.17">want them to have difference and then I</text><text start="3631.529" dur="4.23">want them to relate in a deep way and</text><text start="3633.229" dur="5.5">then I wouldn&apos;t want my ears to be more</text><text start="3635.759" dur="4.5">eyes right like there&apos;s a deeper kind of</text><text start="3638.729" dur="3.181">parallax between ears and eyes where</text><text start="3640.259" dur="3.121">eyes are giving me location of things</text><text start="3641.91" dur="2.97">and ears are giving me a different kind</text><text start="3643.38" dur="3.689">of location thing so the ears with each</text><text start="3644.88" dur="3.569">other give me echolocation and the ears</text><text start="3647.069" dur="2.821">and the eyes together give me a</text><text start="3648.449" dur="5.31">different kind of sense making in</text><text start="3649.89" dur="7.02">3-space so we are mr. Potato Head so if</text><text start="3653.759" dur="4.83">you think about like every imagine if</text><text start="3656.91" dur="3.299">the ears and eyes were just fighting</text><text start="3658.589" dur="3.72">over which was right and the other one</text><text start="3660.209" dur="3.3">was one was comprehensively right in a</text><text start="3662.309" dur="2.581">complete description of reality and the</text><text start="3663.509" dur="2.58">other was comprehensively wrong that</text><text start="3664.89" dur="3.659">would be ridiculous we would dissolve</text><text start="3666.089" dur="4.47">into gibberish right there is a place</text><text start="3668.549" dur="4.32">where they all have accurate information</text><text start="3670.559" dur="3.9">about reality and it&apos;s all partial this</text><text start="3672.869" dur="3.63">speaks to them that initiatives like the</text><text start="3674.459" dur="3.6">third that you mentioned so in the</text><text start="3676.499" dur="2.55">context when the relationship between</text><text start="3678.059" dur="3.96">the eyes in the ears</text><text start="3679.049" dur="5.43">there&apos;s a third we know that third</text><text start="3682.019" dur="4.981">that&apos;s our experience our open vote</text><text start="3684.479" dur="7.761">yeah right so then the question is okay</text><text start="3687.0" dur="7.41">eub eyes over years where&apos;s our third</text><text start="3692.24" dur="3.13">but it didn&apos;t need about that is that</text><text start="3694.41" dur="6.23">then you get some very interesting</text><text start="3695.37" dur="5.27">things where on the one hand you have</text><text start="3700.82" dur="8.92">both of us actually have a clear</text><text start="3704.73" dur="11.49">awareness in ourselves that we are here</text><text start="3709.74" dur="12.24">to with fidelity report what we perceive</text><text start="3716.22" dur="9.95">of reality we are deeply cognizant of</text><text start="3721.98" dur="4.19">the fact that that is not reality</text><text start="3726.59" dur="7.93">we are deeply cogs into the fact that</text><text start="3729.06" dur="8.13">the other is here to report reality and</text><text start="3734.52" dur="5.1">that somehow there is something that can</text><text start="3737.19" dur="4.83">happen that gives a deeper grasp of</text><text start="3739.62" dur="4.59">reality and the reason when I&apos;m zooming</text><text start="3742.02" dur="5.67">in on that is that it actually a lot of</text><text start="3744.21" dur="7.23">the characteristics of this kind of</text><text start="3747.69" dur="7.14">place have to do with a a way to fully</text><text start="3751.44" dur="3.98">and deeply honor like all to [ __ ] you</text><text start="3754.83" dur="3.09">know</text><text start="3755.42" dur="6.97">without the least bit of attachment to</text><text start="3757.92" dur="6.42">any of it and that&apos;s key you have to</text><text start="3762.39" dur="4.02">actually we&apos;re not in the it&apos;s not the</text><text start="3764.34" dur="4.92">priests the trans so we actually want to</text><text start="3766.41" dur="4.59">know lots of stuff I want to have really</text><text start="3769.26" dur="2.97">amazing frameworks we want to have a lot</text><text start="3771.0" dur="3.63">of life experience I want to bring that</text><text start="3772.23" dur="4.2">all the way in but then we also didn&apos;t</text><text start="3774.63" dur="4.44">want to have complete non attachment to</text><text start="3776.43" dur="5.73">any of it and be able to code of create</text><text start="3779.07" dur="5.16">a bespoke since synthetic language in</text><text start="3782.16" dur="3.6">real time if necessary okay so that&apos;s</text><text start="3784.23" dur="3.93">kind of interesting I mean I loved all</text><text start="3785.76" dur="4.47">that okay so I want to add something to</text><text start="3788.16" dur="3.99">this because this is actually like this</text><text start="3790.23" dur="4.05">is really exciting to me so I&apos;ve got</text><text start="3792.15" dur="4.38">lots of senses right and they&apos;re all</text><text start="3794.28" dur="4.1">taking in some true information they can</text><text start="3796.53" dur="4.65">all have error and they&apos;re all partial I</text><text start="3798.38" dur="5.56">also have lots of actuator I can move</text><text start="3801.18" dur="5.13">lots of different muscles and of course</text><text start="3803.94" dur="4.14">the the leg doesn&apos;t want the to compete</text><text start="3806.31" dur="4.23">with the arm for which one gets to be</text><text start="3808.08" dur="3.93">the actuator it actually wants to not</text><text start="3810.54" dur="4.05">just coordinate but to be in a kind of</text><text start="3812.01" dur="4.2">coherence right and so I&apos;ve got lots of</text><text start="3814.59" dur="4.23">sensory stuff I got lots of actuator</text><text start="3816.21" dur="4.53">stuff why is it that it&apos;s not just</text><text start="3818.82" dur="3.86">random splotches of color</text><text start="3820.74" dur="4.619">and sound but it comes together into a</text><text start="3822.68" dur="4.24">coherence of self and world and self in</text><text start="3825.359" dur="4.171">relationship with world as a coherence</text><text start="3826.92" dur="4.86">phenomena so how all the sensing comes</text><text start="3829.53" dur="3.72">together inside of me is a coherence</text><text start="3831.78" dur="3.39">melena that&apos;s the binding problem in</text><text start="3833.25" dur="4.14">neuroscience right and in the philosophy</text><text start="3835.17" dur="4.38">of mind and then the actuator why am I</text><text start="3837.39" dur="3.78">not how do all those parts work together</text><text start="3839.55" dur="3.87">so well as a coherence phenomenon so if</text><text start="3841.17" dur="6.27">we think about that every human on their</text><text start="3843.42" dur="6.27">own the next level up is sensing making</text><text start="3847.44" dur="6.149">sense and activating but then when we</text><text start="3849.69" dur="7.38">come together like I want you sensing</text><text start="3853.589" dur="6.0">stuff differently than I am and I trust</text><text start="3857.07" dur="6.33">that there is information in that that I</text><text start="3859.589" dur="5.401">actually really want to have access to</text><text start="3863.4" dur="3.48">myself and I want the collective to have</text><text start="3864.99" dur="3.93">and I want you actuated differently than</text><text start="3866.88" dur="6.719">I am but I really want to come into</text><text start="3868.92" dur="6.87">coherence so in almost right I mean I</text><text start="3873.599" dur="3.631">wasn&apos;t kind of like that the joke about</text><text start="3875.79" dur="5.069">mr. Potato Head is actually kind of like</text><text start="3877.23" dur="5.43">who is the third right if we personify</text><text start="3880.859" dur="4.831">and your sounds like so we&apos;re all</text><text start="3882.66" dur="4.32">different organs bringing different</text><text start="3885.69" dur="4.02">perspectives when we come together we</text><text start="3886.98" dur="4.56">get dimensionality right we get up</text><text start="3889.71" dur="5.28">whether it&apos;s echolocation of binocular</text><text start="3891.54" dur="7.079">vision we get more out of aggregating</text><text start="3894.99" dur="5.48">and integrating our realities and that</text><text start="3898.619" dur="3.72">then becomes as you said not just</text><text start="3900.47" dur="5.44">fragmented data feeds it becomes a</text><text start="3902.339" dur="7.311">Gestalt boom though it becomes a reality</text><text start="3905.91" dur="6.33">for some supersensible</text><text start="3909.65" dur="5.07">version of us that is greater than the</text><text start="3912.24" dur="2.48">sum of its parts</text><text start="3914.78" dur="3.0">yeah</text><text start="3918.75" dur="8.74">so you said initial conditions good with</text><text start="3924.88" dur="5.129">novelty and Auntie fragile but what and</text><text start="3927.49" dur="4.109">then you also said hey the mind that&apos;s</text><text start="3930.009" dur="3.181">running like you take the societal</text><text start="3931.599" dur="3.361">structure off but the mind the mind that</text><text start="3933.19" dur="4.23">was formatted to support this assisted</text><text start="3934.96" dur="4.29">social structure persists even if you</text><text start="3937.42" dur="3.48">have this experience it&apos;s gonna get</text><text start="3939.25" dur="3.569">looped back through old with</text><text start="3940.9" dur="6.24">fundamentally gamei habits and patterns</text><text start="3942.819" dur="7.861">which sounds super [ __ ] fragile this</text><text start="3947.14" dur="6.479">right like like right now coherence is</text><text start="3950.68" dur="5.399">highly highly fragile yes and yet you&apos;re</text><text start="3953.619" dur="4.351">also saying it either has an inherent</text><text start="3956.079" dur="4.95">property or maybe you just hope that it</text><text start="3957.97" dur="5.22">would be ultimately eventually anti</text><text start="3961.029" dur="3.48">fragile can we pull that up up because I</text><text start="3963.19" dur="3.869">think I wouldn&apos;t be having this</text><text start="3964.509" dur="4.86">conversation if it was a done deal</text><text start="3967.059" dur="4.111">or if the first time people glimpsed it</text><text start="3969.369" dur="4.47">we&apos;re like [ __ ] got it let&apos;s go rock</text><text start="3971.17" dur="5.609">with this this is actually wildly</text><text start="3973.839" dur="5.851">delicate right now yeah I think this if</text><text start="3976.779" dur="4.711">you if you hold in your mind the example</text><text start="3979.69" dur="3.179">the game of game that this happens of</text><text start="3981.49" dur="5.4">you like the best current example of</text><text start="3982.869" dur="6.39">coherence and it really is like in the</text><text start="3986.89" dur="5.369">entire universe as far as we know it by</text><text start="3989.259" dur="5.971">the best actual example of coherence and</text><text start="3992.259" dur="5.58">then we say okay well if we do the</text><text start="3995.23" dur="4.109">Anthropology and we take a look back and</text><text start="3997.839" dur="6.301">say okay well how long did it take to</text><text start="3999.339" dur="6.21">pull that [ __ ] together finding the</text><text start="4004.14" dur="5.58">member I had that spot in possibility</text><text

those people like instead of like a</text><text start="4375.34" dur="4.5">narrowband</text><text start="4376.679" dur="4.571">broadband so the question of how do we</text><text start="4379.84" dur="6.45">scale coherence I think is all three of</text><text start="4381.25" dur="6.51">those simultaneously if you would if you</text><text start="4386.29" dur="3.17">mind if we can go back to the

dur="10.111">that I&apos;ve found is that most of the</text><text start="4397.81" dur="9.98">failures to show up seem to actually</text><text start="4403.06" dur="8.51">fail for relatively simple reasons</text><text start="4407.79" dur="3.78">having to do with</text><text start="4416.739" dur="7.211">either the particularity zuv how human</text><text start="4420.85" dur="6.73">development in

start="4429.14" dur="6.329">sapiens delivery what you might call a</text><text start="4430.969" dur="5.791">species level trauma so either people</text><text start="4435.469" dur="2.851">who are entering into coherence enter</text><text start="4436.76" dur="2.85">into relations of codependency where</text><text start="4438.32" dur="2.88">you&apos;ve talked about you know the

either hard-coded into homo</text><text start="4445.43" dur="7.07">are coded in what humaneness is at the</text><text start="4448.489" dur="6.5">at the more sort of a primal level or</text><text start="4452.5" dur="4.39">because we are human beings who</text><text start="4454.989" dur="4.931">universally have been developed in the</text><text start="4456.89" dur="4.89">context of society

actually gone</text><text start="4472.07" dur="3.48">through all the work of actually at the</text><text start="4473.21" dur="5.46">very least resolving yourself out of the</text><text start="4475.55" dur="4.439">trauma of society to the extent that you</text><text start="4478.67" dur="5.93">know to pretty high extent to be</text><text start="4479.989" dur="9.891">perfectly honest and then having a</text><text start="4484.6" dur="5.28">capacity of being conscious of how</text><text start="4491.23" dur="4.0">biological instincts and habits that are</text><text start="4493.4" dur="4.8">hardwired

start="4514.25" dur="7.11">and so because now we&apos;re dealing</text><text start="4517.64" dur="5.849">obviously there are no folks comfortably</text><text start="4521.36" dur="4.17">camping out in

start="4616.119" dur="6.171">one of the problems that tends to happen</text><text start="4617.889" dur="7.591">is there&apos;s a real significant meaningful</text><text start="4622.29"

dur="3.359">when you are closer this is crucial</text><text start="4668.139" dur="3.451">right being able to distinguish the</text><text start="4669.159" dur="5.881">difference between when you are

the</text><text start="4972.17" dur="9.36">question and in addition to the three of</text><text start="4977.12" dur="8.07">us and whatever the container or</text><text start="4981.53"

dur="4.73">that&apos;s included in the consideration</text><text start="5001.66" dur="5.82">something between comprehensible and/or</text><text start="5004.14" dur="6.099">interesting there&apos;s a third to the enth</text><text start="5007.48" dur="4.38">I mean I I would at least I feel like</text><text start="5010.239" dur="5.631">there was never been moments little</text><text start="5011.86" dur="7.62">blips where there&apos;s been at least for me</text><text start="5015.87" dur="5.53">new or interesting perspectives and our</text><text start="5019.48" dur="4.08">house and insights and I

a feeling that they&apos;re not</text><text start="5035.199" dur="3.301">being something coming from Daniel that</text><text start="5037.33" dur="2.849">actually creates the right kind of</text><text

that is not responsive but</text><text start="5044.26" dur="4.61">is in fact direct like coming from the</text><text start="5046.449" dur="2.421">inside out</text><text start="5053.61" dur="9.72">the thing that was feeling to share I</text><text start="5057.82" dur="10.2">just didn&apos;t hear a spot where it was in</text><text start="5063.33" dur="6.22">it was relevant actually very much</text><text start="5068.02" dur="3.21">connects to the conversation that the</text><text start="5069.55" dur="6.72">two of you were having but it was what I</text><text start="5071.23" dur="9.9">was thinking about anyways which is this</text><text start="5076.27" dur="7.58">relationship between the subordination</text><text start="5081.13" dur="7.65">of the individual for the collective and</text><text start="5083.85" dur="8.47">the sovereignty of the individual like</text><text start="5088.78" dur="8.1">fractal sovereignty and I was thinking</text><text start="5092.32" dur="6.57">about the body as an analogy of it&apos;s</text><text start="5096.88" dur="5.49">such a fascinating thing where all of</text><text start="5098.89" dur="6.96">the cells are autonomous agents governed</text><text start="5102.37" dur="5.04">by their own internal genetic code they</text><text start="5105.85" dur="3.81">could grow in a petri dish for some</text><text start="5107.41" dur="4.59">period of time but they&apos;re operating in</text><text start="5109.66" dur="3.96">a way that is both in their own good</text><text start="5112.0" dur="3.09">interest and in the interest of the</text><text start="5113.62" dur="3.51">other cells around them in the entire</text><text start="5115.09" dur="5.13">body simultaneously so there isn&apos;t a</text><text start="5117.13" dur="4.44">theory of trade-offs of what is good for</text><text start="5120.22" dur="3.18">them is damaging other or they&apos;re</text><text start="5121.57" dur="4.38">sacrificing themselves for other and</text><text start="5123.4" dur="4.47">that&apos;s tripped the level of cell-to-cell</text><text start="5125.95" dur="4.23">but it&apos;s also true at the level of organ</text><text start="5127.87" dur="6.24">to organ and organ systems organ system</text><text start="5130.18" dur="6.54">and cell to organ so at vertical levels</text><text start="5134.11" dur="5.97">and horizontal levels there&apos;s this kind</text><text start="5136.72" dur="5.25">of just radical anti rival risk synergy</text><text start="5140.08" dur="3.96">of sovereign things of things that have</text><text start="5141.97" dur="4.11">their own self-organizing boundary the</text><text start="5144.04" dur="4.05">facha of the organ the cell membrane and</text><text start="5146.08" dur="5.82">we&apos;re talking about that at the next</text><text start="5148.09" dur="5.37">level of organism to organism and we&apos;ve</text><text start="5151.9" dur="4.32">done that up to tribe and now we&apos;re</text><text start="5153.46" dur="5.85">talking about beyond tribal scale but</text><text start="5156.22" dur="4.26">that that kind of process and I&apos;m</text><text start="5159.31" dur="5.94">thinking about cancer in the body</text><text start="5160.48" dur="6.84">because a cancer cell starts doing what</text><text start="5165.25" dur="4.08">seems to be in the short-term better for</text><text start="5167.32" dur="4.68">it it actually replicates it consumes</text><text start="5169.33" dur="4.77">and replicates faster but it breaks down</text><text start="5172.0" dur="3.48">the coherence of the whole and in the</text><text start="5174.1" dur="3.24">process it ends up killing itself</text><text start="5175.48" dur="3.66">killing its progeny right it suicides</text><text start="5177.34" dur="4.26">because it debases the substrate that it</text><text start="5179.14" dur="4.72">depends upon in kind of a short term</text><text start="5181.6" dur="9.61">small-minded focus</text><text start="5183.86" dur="9.64">and so there&apos;s this idea like regard to</text><text start="5191.21" dur="4.09">like the there&apos;s an interesting feeling</text><text start="5193.5" dur="5.01">even of that way of speaking of it as</text><text start="5195.3" dur="5.76">subordinate the individual and I was</text><text start="5198.51" dur="3.78">just thinking of Einstein&apos;s quote that</text><text start="5201.06" dur="2.97">it&apos;s an optical delusion of</text><text start="5202.29" dur="3.99">consciousness to think there are</text><text start="5204.03" dur="4.59">separate things when in fact there is</text><text start="5206.28" dur="7.4">one integrated reality that we call</text><text start="5208.62" dur="8.16">universe and so like we can actually</text><text start="5213.68" dur="6.13">rationally get and something I think</text><text start="5216.78" dur="4.38">about all the time is ok I can think</text><text start="5219.81" dur="4.38">about myself as a separate thing but</text><text start="5221.16" dur="5.28">what am i without the atmosphere I don&apos;t</text><text start="5224.19"

dur="4.59">that made the things that I use and the</text><text start="5235.11" dur="5.43">concepts that I use so when I get that</text><text start="5238.14" dur="3.68">I&apos;m an emergent property of the hole</text><text start="5240.54" dur="4.2">that has uniqueness and individuality</text><text start="5241.82" dur="4.95">but it&apos;s not separable from that the</text><text start="5244.74" dur="4.8">distinctness doesn&apos;t mean separable &apos;ti</text><text start="5246.77" dur="4.78">then I have both distinct and</text><text start="5249.54" dur="4.65">inseparable simultaneously so I have</text><text start="5251.55" dur="4.95">interconnected with the whole and having</text><text start="5254.19" dur="3.81">a unique role to play and so the</text><text start="5256.5" dur="4.74">dialectic there is something that</text><text start="5258.0" dur="5.4">increases actually the distinction and</text><text start="5261.24" dur="7.28">the uniqueness and increases the synergy</text><text start="5263.4" dur="7.98">and interconnectivity simultaneously and</text><text start="5268.52" dur="4.63">the first part is to just recognize if</text><text start="5271.38" dur="3.51">I&apos;m doing the cancer thing it will end</text><text start="5273.15" dur="3.87">up being bad for what I care about too</text><text start="5274.89" dur="4.56">even if in the short term it

war is</text><text start="5289.85" dur="4.96">existential now so we can&apos;t even</text><text start="5293.22" dur="3.24">rationalize that we can keep doing it</text><text start="5294.81" dur="2.69">that way I&apos;m noticing understand that</text><text start="5296.46" dur="4.29">I&apos;m trying to get to the feeling of it</text><text start="5297.5" dur="6.01">which is by the way quite hard but one</text><text start="5300.75" dur="4.05">of the places I landed was that you know</text><text start="5303.51" dur="3.57">we still have that nice example of the</text><text start="5304.8" dur="3.63">jazz band fortunately we actually have</text><text start="5307.08" dur="4.11">concrete examples of what these things</text><text start="5308.43" dur="4.89">are like to be in and I&apos;m noticing that</text><text start="5311.19" dur="4.82">as a player in the jazz band that</text><text start="5313.32" dur="2.69">feeling of</text><text start="5316.44" dur="5.79">not being subordinated

some</text><text start="5330.75" dur="5.97">people not many I think try to think</text><text start="5334.65" dur="3.72">about that strategically like okay how</text><text start="5336.72" dur="2.42">do I make sure that I am in fact</text><text start="5338.37" dur="4.92">protected</text><text start="5339.14" dur="6.73">most people are in fact proceeding by do</text><text start="5343.29" dur="4.95">I actually feel like I am increasing my</text><text start="5345.87" dur="3.87">autonomy do I feel more agenting and</text><text start="5348.24" dur="4.68">more autonomous and more able to express</text><text start="5349.74" dur="6.15">my essence or selfness</text><text start="5352.92" dur="4.92">into world symmetries like what does</text><text start="5355.89" dur="3.51">that feel like to actually move into</text><text start="5357.84" dur="2.67">that place and if we could do it like</text><text start="5359.4" dur="2.76">what would actually have felt like for</text><text start="5360.51" dur="3.57">this single cell going into the multi</text><text start="5362.16" dur="3.81">cell because there&apos;s something about the</text><text start="5364.08" dur="10.08">quality of

part</text><text start="5691.73" dur="4.32">of discernment and being able to listen</text><text start="5693.83" dur="3.48">and say okay my heart aches when</text><text start="5696.05" dur="3.84">somebody says something alright well</text><text start="5697.31" dur="4.38">that&apos;s probably real deep important true</text><text start="5699.89" dur="4.5">learn how to listen to it

you and I have actually got</text><text start="5753.08" dur="3.24">to have more conversations on these</text><text start="5754.52" dur="4.83">topics more recently than we have</text><text

got</text><text start="5782.84" dur="4.77">some recently shared language on these</text><text start="5784.73" dur="5.19">things and but the rule Omega is</text><text start="5787.61" dur="5.25">actually a really simple practical thing</text><text start="5789.92" dur="8.64">that I towards coherence that I would</text><text start="5792.86" dur="8.01">like everybody here to get is if if</text><text start="5798.56" dur="5.19">Jordan mare talking or if you and I are</text><text start="5800.87" dur="4.2">talking like we we have this and I think</text><text start="5803.75" dur="5.03">we naturally have it as worth making</text><text start="5805.07" dur="8.22">explicit is if you say something that</text><text start="5808.78" dur="7.33">sounds ridiculous to me or batshit crazy</text><text start="5813.29" dur="6.18">or wrong I actually give the benefit of</text><text start="5816.11" dur="5.85">the doubt that you might have a reason</text><text start="5819.47" dur="4.32">that I didn&apos;t understand first so rather</text><text start="5821.96" dur="6.54">than just default into you&apos;re probably</text><text start="5823.79" dur="6.21">wrong ask more questions and and that</text><text start="5828.5" dur="3.54">giving the benefit of the doubt that you</text><text start="5830.0" dur="5.73">actually might have something useful to</text><text start="5832.04" dur="5.79">say increases my making sure that I</text><text start="5835.73" dur="4.41">understand you before I&apos;m responding and</text><text start="5837.83" dur="3.39">that actually and the disagreeing was</text><text start="5840.14" dur="2.61">something that you weren&apos;t even saying</text><text start="5841.22" dur="4.02">because I didn&apos;t seek to understand well</text><text start="5842.75" dur="4.29">enough creates very turbulent flow</text><text start="5845.24" dur="2.43">rather than laminar flow breaks down</text><text start="5847.04" dur="3.96">coherence</text><text start="5847.67" dur="5.64">right if people could just do that</text><text start="5851.0" dur="3.96">towards coherence if they could just</text><text start="5853.31" dur="7.77">give the benefit of the doubt that each</text><text start="5854.96" dur="7.56">other that everyone has some signal even</text><text start="5861.08" dur="2.91">if it&apos;s on a very different part of</text><text start="5862.52" dur="3.72">reality than the part they&apos;re focused on</text><text start="5863.99" dur="5.09">and even if there&apos;s noise involved and</text><text start="5866.24" dur="5.46">they&apos;re listening for the signal first</text><text start="5869.08" dur="3.55">that would change everything that&apos;s a</text><text start="5871.7" dur="3.03">starting place</text><text start="5872.63" dur="3.0">so Daniel expresses something and let&apos;s</text><text start="5874.73" dur="2.82">see he&apos;s trying to suppose something&apos;s</text><text start="5875.63" dur="4.7">hard which by the way the rule make is</text><text start="5877.55" dur="4.38">designed for that kind of a thing like</text><text start="5880.33" dur="2.68">I&apos;m not interested in having</text><text start="5881.93" dur="3.78">conversations that aren&apos;t actually</text><text start="5883.01" dur="4.11">trying to break new ground so okay do it</text><text start="5885.71" dur="5.04">dude so you expressing something hard</text><text start="5887.12" dur="5.7">and in the expression ninety-eight</text><text start="5890.75" dur="4.32">percent is noise and two percent is</text><text start="5892.82" dur="3.96">signal like the chance riff but what</text><text start="5895.07" dur="4.62">happens is that my job is to actually do</text><text start="5896.78" dur="5.19">two things one hold all of it not just</text><text start="5899.69" dur="3.21">say [ __ ] that was that wasn&apos;t a</text><text start="5901.97" dur="2.7">hundred percent right so I&apos;m just gonna</text><text start="5902.9" dur="5.19">nuke it hold all of it</text><text start="5904.67" dur="6.15">then in my self discernment to what</text><text start="5908.09" dur="4.44">degree can i express something back that</text><text start="5910.82" dur="4.64">gets rid of the fifty fifty percent that</text><text start="5912.53" dur="6.06">is noise so now I&apos;ve got six percent</text><text start="5915.46" dur="4.0">signal express it back and of course if</text><text start="5918.59" dur="3.09">he can then do that</text><text start="5919.46" dur="3.96">and now you three is even better a more</text><text start="5921.68" dur="2.52">profound instrument because you&apos;re gonna</text><text start="5923.42" dur="2.07">be bringing a different perspective</text><text start="5924.2" dur="3.21">perhaps you can take it and actually</text><text start="5925.49" dur="3.96">zoom in on it down to the point where</text><text start="5927.41" dur="2.43">actually 50 percent signal that&apos;s the</text><text start="5929.45" dur="2.22">idea</text><text start="5929.84" dur="3.36">right and so one it&apos;s an invitation to</text><text start="5931.67" dur="2.85">say hey we&apos;re trying to do some things</text><text start="5933.2" dur="2.94">hard let&apos;s all try to do something</text><text start="5934.52" dur="9.66">that&apos;s hard to be willing to take the</text><text start="5936.14" dur="10.8">risk of not speaking elegantly and on</text><text start="5944.18" dur="6.42">the premise that everyone else is doing</text><text start="5946.94" dur="6.03">their absolute

start="5955.01" dur="4.29">themselves like oh there it is tone got</text><text start="5957.35" dur="4.41">it there&apos;s something beautiful and clear</text><text start="5959.3" dur="4.59">there here&apos;s what I heard and that&apos;s</text><text start="5961.76" dur="4.62">real Omega and there&apos;s a psychological</text><text start="5963.89" dur="6.15">safety that&apos;s created to be able

start="5971.06" dur="3.27">the benefit of the doubt so it actually</text><text start="5972.77" dur="4.32">does become more explorative and that&apos;s</text><text start="5974.33" dur="4.02">where you get more novelty and then I</text><text start="5977.09" dur="2.52">imagine I don&apos;t know if this is true for</text><text start="5978.35" dur="2.61">Daniel I imagine it&apos;s true for you

start="6345.88" dur="3.029">switch this domain I&apos;m thinking about</text><text start="6347.17" dur="2.819">the folks in this side of the camera so</text><text start="6348.909" dur="2.911">let&apos;s take this and make this practical</text><text start="6349.989" dur="7.8">in the context of sense making in the</text><text start="6351.82" dur="7.35">world we live in right now

yeah it&apos;s a</text><text start="6394.3" dur="7.46">mess so game a has a sense making</text><text start="6399.94" dur="6.15">architecture</text><text start="6401.76" dur="5.5">broadly speaking waste of time well that</text><text start="6406.09" dur="2.909">opens up some very interesting</text><text start="6407.26" dur="3.709">challenges alright and this goes back to</text><text

say is</text><text start="6419.429" dur="15.88">holding yourself a feeling of care for</text><text start="6427.469" dur="11.17">everything and then truly act and make</text><text start="6435.309"

it</text><text start="6442.539" dur="3.69">think globally act locally</text><text start="6443.639" dur="5.02">just take that seriously like the</text><text start="6446.229" dur="4.77">reality is is

but I think it&apos;s super critical</text><text start="6600.25" dur="6.18">so I want to emphasize it which is okay</text><text start="6604.66" dur="3.0">so why can&apos;t we trust any of the things</text><text start="6606.43" dur="2.61">that normally look like sense-making</text><text start="6607.66" dur="5.07">well there&apos;s a bunch of reasons but</text><text start="6609.04" dur="5.64">basically we learn how to do signaling</text><text start="6612.73" dur="4.65">for intentional game theoretic purposes</text><text start="6614.68" dur="4.86">and so rather than just share signal</text><text start="6617.38" dur="3.48">that is true and representative we share</text><text start="6619.54" dur="4.98">signal that will advantage some</text><text start="6620.86" dur="9.15">rivalries agenda so most signal ends up</text><text start="6624.52" dur="9.93">being that and one of the things that</text><text start="6630.01" dur="6.87">you were just saying is a consequence of</text><text start="6634.45" dur="5.46">it is that there&apos;s an ethic to not [ __ ]</text><text start="6636.88" dur="4.44">up the information ecology right like in</text><text

dur="5.1">mentioning earlier that the people who</text><text start="7112.29" dur="5.07">went into the Arctic like probably most</text><text start="7114.9" dur="3.6">of them failed and then some small

dur="4.44">that make it through are awesome right</text><text start="7136.62" dur="2.79">and one of the things you&apos;re asking</text><text start="7137.79" dur="4.77">about timing is can we do

up for</text><text start="7607.17" dur="5.96">sure and it&apos;s recursive I was landing</text><text start="7611.49" dur="5.79">there as well I was thinking okay so</text><text start="7613.13" dur="5.23">state and stage obviously for me the</text><text start="7617.28" dur="5.16">first thing that comes up in terms of</text><text start="7618.36" dur="5.64">state is there&apos;s the constant recurrence</text><text start="7622.44" dur="2.73">of the trap of taking the state for the</text><text start="7624.0" dur="2.46">stage all right so let&apos;s carefully</text><text start="7625.17"

big</text><text start="7639.3" dur="4.23">red flag state is not staged the state</text><text start="7642.12" dur="5.25">is not going to get you to stage by</text><text start="7643.53" dur="5.91">itself take it slow okay so then what</text><text start="7647.37" dur="3.48">happens in state and as I was kind of</text><text start="7649.44" dur="4.2">just again for some first-person</text><text start="7650.85" dur="4.23">experience well a lot of the stuff that</text><text start="7653.64" dur="3.66">we were talking about in terms of what</text><text start="7655.08" dur="5.4">given individual has to actually be able</text><text start="7657.3" dur="5.28">to come into to be able to start</text><text start="7660.48" dur="4.65">participating in a direct

dur="4.88">to try to heal trauma trauma healing can</text><text start="7670.23" dur="5.67">happen very well with say psychedelics</text><text start="7672.77" dur="4.63">art of transparent mind really really</text><text start="7675.9" dur="5.16">effectively supported by certain kinds</text><text start="7677.4" dur="4.68">of ecstatic states so there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="7681.06" dur="2.58">things I think I think if you actually</text><text start="7682.08" dur="3.75">take the state and think of it as an</text><text start="7683.64" dur="5.04">instrument they can be pointed at</text><text start="7685.83" dur="6.0">particular capacities that can be moved</text><text start="7688.68" dur="5.34">into stage because or through the use of</text><text start="7691.83"

start="8924.359" dur="3.781">actually I noticed it&apos;s such an odd</text><text start="8925.949" dur="7.111">thing for me is that I grew up in in</text><text start="8928.14" dur="6.42">Texas in the 70s so where prayer at</text><text start="8933.06" dur="4.35">mealtimes was actually very commonplace</text><text start="8934.56" dur="4.08">but my family didn&apos;t practice that so I</text><text start="8937.41" dur="5.279">had this experience of like what the</text><text start="8938.64" dur="5.759">heck is that and this was when move into</text><text start="8942.689" dur="3.481">secularism and even the New Atheism was</text><text start="8944.399" dur="3.09">becoming part of the cultural fabric so</text><text start="8946.17" dur="4.62">as would is that and also a little bit</text><text start="8947.489" dur="5.37">of like that&apos;s not cool alright and as I</text><text start="8950.79" dur="3.12">got older that actually kind of</text><text start="8952.859" dur="2.941">disappeared but I&apos;ve actually noticed</text><text start="8953.91" dur="3.9">over the past what maybe even four years</text><text start="8955.8" dur="4.229">I&apos;ve actually been to build a prayer and</text><text start="8957.81" dur="4.049">mealtime practice myself but from the</text><text start="8960.029" dur="4.29">inside out meaning that it&apos;s not formal</text><text start="8961.859" dur="4.021">it&apos;s not imposed I&apos;m not like we&apos;re just</text><text start="8964.319" dur="4.08">reciting a script that I&apos;ve learned I</text><text start="8965.88" dur="5.399">haven&apos;t learned it rather I had an</text><text start="8968.399" dur="5.431">insight which was oh well there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="8971.279" dur="7.441">of basic practices like feeling deep</text><text start="8973.83" dur="8.069">gratitude that are crucial and you</text><text start="8978.72" dur="4.8">always have to eat yeah so I would</text><text start="8981.899" dur="3.63">always forget to have my gratitude</text><text start="8983.52" dur="3.87">practice but when I said you know what</text><text start="8985.529" dur="3.21">I&apos;m gonna do this before I eat I&apos;m gonna</text><text start="8987.39" dur="2.639">do my gratitude practice I&apos;m just gonna</text><text start="8988.739" dur="3.301">bind something that just has this really</text><text

really</text><text start="8995.52" dur="5.219">useful and has a little bit of cultural</text><text start="8998.279" dur="4.17">Vectren just combine the two and then it</text><text start="9000.739" dur="4.74">just began to expand from there so this</text><text start="9002.449" dur="4.651">is of course the recreation of ritual it</text><text start="9005.479" dur="4.141">is also part of the story yeah and</text><text start="9007.1" dur="4.62">that&apos;s a lot of culture hacking we can</text><text start="9009.62" dur="6.449">do right I mean I mean grace gratitude</text><text start="9011.72" dur="6.509">at dinner Shabbos you know Sabbath day</text><text start="9016.069" dur="3.781">down a down day every week to reflect</text><text start="9018.229" dur="4.771">and reset like these are simple things</text><text start="9019.85" dur="4.86">that are easy to dust off and reanimate</text><text start="9023.0" dur="3.63">and I really think again I think there&apos;s</text><text start="9024.71" dur="3.269">a lot that can be open sourced we just</text><text start="9026.63" dur="4.859">have to make sure that we&apos;re not open</text><text start="9027.979" dur="5.742">sourcing

about</text><text start="9056.631" dur="6.189">education that is not teaching info but</text><text start="9059.011" dur="5.91">that is facilitating Epiphany yeah when</text><text start="9062.82" dur="3.42">someone has real epiphany and they</text><text start="9064.921" dur="2.67">figure out something that&apos;s useful and</text><text start="9066.24" dur="2.79">then they teach other people and the</text><text start="9067.591" dur="3.0">other people don&apos;t understand why and</text><text start="9069.03" dur="3.84">that happens a few generations the</text><text start="9070.591" dur="5.04">Dharma becomes dogma right like the</text><text start="9072.87" dur="3.811">thing that that had real wisdom just</text><text start="9075.631" dur="3.479">becomes a thing to do because the</text><text start="9076.681" dur="3.779">authorities told us and then liberation</text><text start="9079.11" dur="3.63">actually looks like rebelling against it</text><text start="9080.46" dur="4.65">and even if we&apos;re submitting to it we</text><text start="9082.74" dur="4.321">don&apos;t really get the gist and so to not</text><text start="9085.11" dur="5.55">have Dharma become dogma and become a</text><text start="9087.061" dur="5.7">control system it has to be alive and</text><text start="9090.66" dur="3.901">real and rediscovered for everyone and</text><text start="9092.761" dur="3.689">that&apos;s a different process than an</text><text start="9094.561" dur="4.049">emetic transmission exactly the medic</text><text start="9096.45" dur="4.981">transmission well what about a catalytic</text><text start="9098.61" dur="5.701">mimetic because that has to be a lot of</text><text start="9101.431" dur="4.769">good syllables doesn&apos;t it sound like no</text><text start="9104.311" dur="4.639">truly I mean what would to your point</text><text start="9106.2" dur="5.46">about your you&apos;re giving your to your</text><text start="9108.95" dur="6.51">disclosing and the protocols for self</text><text start="9111.66" dur="6.09">disclosure that that could arguably be a</text><text start="9115.46" dur="4.45">catalytic them principles more than</text><text start="9117.75" dur="4.08">protocols mmm-hmm yeah yeah no more I</text><text start="9119.91" dur="6.45">mean I&apos;m interested like we&apos;re even a</text><text start="9121.83" dur="8.0">mythopoetic catalytic mimetic so what is</text><text start="9126.36" dur="6.21">the story of how we begin to remember</text><text start="9129.83" dur="5.2">and it&apos;s going to have to be again more</text><text start="9132.57" dur="5.79">in the direction of poetry or the</text><text start="9135.03" dur="5.88">parable of how we begin to remember so</text><text start="9138.36" dur="4.951">that it&apos;s hinting to people in</text><text start="9140.91" dur="5.82">themselves moments in their lives but</text><text start="9143.311" dur="5.099">they have in fact come across

then I</text><text start="9156.271" dur="5.58">can testify by the fruits right and then</text><text start="9160.681" dur="4.799">we have to be very mindful of the fact</text><text start="9161.851" dur="6.299">that you this is what the twelfth</text><text start="9165.48" dur="6.93">done we&apos;ve kind of gone through this</text><text start="9168.15" dur="8.4">cycle on who&apos;s counting which

dur="4.741">it&apos;s not very slow now it&apos;s in the very</text><text start="9232.11" dur="5.61">quickly compounding place and so we&apos;re</text><text start="9235.141" dur="4.349">getting exponentially larger levers on</text><text start="9237.72" dur="4.28">our choices but we&apos;re not getting</text><text start="9239.49" dur="5.37">exponentially better choice making and</text><text start="9242.0" dur="4.99">so we are getting the power of gods</text><text start="9244.86" dur="4.05">without getting the love or wisdom of</text><text start="9246.99" dur="5.64">gods to wield that

start="9254.7" dur="6.24">power of gods that seems eminent and</text><text start="9257.311" dur="5.46">unavoidable and so they&apos;re really like</text><text start="9260.94" dur="5.76">there really is this enlightenment or</text><text start="9262.771" dur="7.019">bust thing that I see which is if we</text><text start="9266.7" dur="4.981">have catastrophic level tech not just</text><text start="9269.79" dur="4.981">isolated two state actors but they can</text><text start="9271.681" dur="7.71">be radically decentralized who gets to</text><text start="9274.771" dur="6.149">be totally [ __ ] up nobody or even not</text><text start="9279.391" dur="4.439">be very Omni considerate to can do</text><text start="9280.92" dur="5.82">catastrophic stuff on accident so this</text><text start="9283.83" dur="5.4">is like the existential Bodhisattva yes</text><text start="9286.74" dur="4.56">it is this is the bodhisattva imperative</text><text start="9289.23" dur="3.871">actually has to become universal for us</text><text start="9291.3" dur="3.48">to make it through this phase and that</text><text start="9293.101" dur="2.579">wasn&apos;t true in the Bronze Age or Stone</text><text start="9294.78" dur="2.73">Age or Iron Age</text><text start="9295.68" dur="3.45">the other ages because we could just</text><text start="9297.51" dur="3.63">kill a lot of people we could destroy a</text><text start="9299.13" dur="3.45">lot of environments and we did now it&apos;s</text><text start="9301.14" dur="2.67">just kill everybody in all environment</text><text start="9302.58" dur="2.52">right so let&apos;s then jump back to the</text><text start="9303.81" dur="3.75">story I was trying to tell earlier quite</text><text start="9305.1" dur="5.099">poorly so zone of proximal development</text><text start="9307.56" dur="5.549">we&apos;ve all got that notion right that</text><text start="9310.199" dur="4.74">there&apos;s a place we could get to now</text><text start="9313.109" dur="5.271">let&apos;s think about them the level up from</text><text start="9314.939" dur="6.75">Homo habilis to homo sapiens and the</text><text start="9318.38" dur="6.04">many many different things that all had</text><text start="9321.689" dur="4.25">to come together simultaneously for that</text><text start="9324.42" dur="4.59">zone of proximal development tool and</text><text start="9325.939" dur="5.141">you had to have yet Yatta knee and</text><text start="9329.01" dur="3.42">grandmothers and fathers and the</text><text start="9331.08" dur="3.96">emergence of the capacity for language</text><text start="9332.43" dur="3.84">and a certain affinity to not beat the</text><text start="9335.04" dur="2.46">[ __ ] out of other males as soon as you</text><text start="9336.27" dur="4.589">can counter like a whole bunch of stuff</text><text start="9337.5" dur="5.52">each one of which independently isn&apos;t</text><text start="9340.859" dur="3.721">necessary particularly useful and any</text><text start="9343.02" dur="3.209">one of which is lacking it the thing</text><text start="9344.58" dur="3.51">doesn&apos;t hold together very well right so</text><text start="9346.229" dur="3.241">you&apos;ve got a bunch of like little micro</text><text start="9348.09" dur="2.82">versions and if they don&apos;t that don&apos;t</text><text start="9349.47" dur="2.729">work and they fall apart until</text><text start="9350.91" dur="3.63">eventually get to the zone of proximal</text><text start="9352.199" dur="4.441">development and then pop it kind of pops</text><text start="9354.54" dur="4.439">together I was thinking about that in</text><text start="9356.64" dur="4.559">terms of oK we&apos;ve we&apos;re in this place</text><text start="9358.979" dur="4.291">for all right we&apos;re making another run</text><text start="9361.199" dur="3.691">at it we&apos;re trying to get we&apos;re trying</text><text start="9363.27" dur="4.62">to get to this spot and the question is</text><text start="9364.89" dur="4.65">well was what are the pieces what are</text><text start="9367.89" dur="2.94">the pieces of the puzzle and I was</text><text start="9369.54" dur="2.76">really interested in like noticing that</text><text start="9370.83" dur="3.149">we&apos;ve got a whole bunch and they come</text><text start="9372.3" dur="3.929">from lots of different places you know</text><text start="9373.979" dur="5.101">you mentioned the Quakers and the Sioux</text><text start="9376.229" dur="3.991">and we&apos;ve talked about like Buddhism has</text><text start="9379.08" dur="3.3">stuff like non-attachment</text><text start="9380.22" dur="3.479">like one of the interesting traps for</text><text start="9382.38" dur="3.24">example I was thinking through in terms</text><text start="9383.699" dur="4.851">of like okay if I had an epiphany and I</text><text start="9385.62" dur="4.829">want to share it and it turns to Dogma</text><text start="9388.55" dur="5.17">one of the reasons when in terms of</text><text start="9390.449" dur="6.361">Dogma is attachment I want people I&apos;m</text><text start="9393.72" dur="4.92">attached to the good word and so some</text><text start="9396.81" dur="3.75">interesting things about okay what&apos;s the</text><text start="9398.64" dur="6.66">toolkit what are the pieces of this next</text><text start="9400.56" dur="8.19">stage that if they come together they</text><text start="9405.3" dur="5.07">mutually support each other like the mat</text><text start="9408.75" dur="2.91">that when people stand in a circle they</text><text start="9410.37" dur="2.43">all kind of like turn and they begin to</text><text start="9411.66" dur="3.21">sit down simultaneously</text><text start="9412.8" dur="3.36">we&apos;re just perfectly as you begin to</text><text start="9414.87" dur="2.34">lose your balance you sit and you land</text><text start="9416.16" dur="2.4">on somebody else&apos;s knees and it goes all</text><text start="9417.21" dur="3.63">the way around the whole circle like</text><text start="9418.56" dur="4.02">what&apos;s that thing where all the pieces</text><text start="9420.84" dur="3.0">come together and the stage now has the</text><text start="9422.58" dur="5.27">elements that support each other so we</text><text start="9423.84" dur="4.01">actually have reached a new place</text><text start="9428.42" dur="4.6">and what I notice is this this really</text><text start="9430.68" dur="3.45">interesting thing where like if I</text><text start="9433.02" dur="2.97">applied non-attachment</text><text start="9434.13" dur="3.54">and humility by the way which are really</text><text start="9435.99" dur="2.73">interesting cross products if they&apos;re</text><text start="9437.67" dur="2.58">coming from very different Latin</text><text start="9438.72" dur="2.58">lineages and they reinforce each other</text><text start="9440.25" dur="4.83">quite nice so say them again</text><text start="9441.3" dur="8.25">non-attachment and humility in the</text><text start="9445.08" dur="6.78">context of urgency and in the context by</text><text start="9449.55" dur="5.4">the way of we&apos;ve done a lot of</text><text start="9451.86" dur="4.53">conversations about the if you really</text><text start="9454.95" dur="3.05">really think clearly about the</text><text start="9456.39" dur="3.81">circumstances that we find ourselves in</text><text start="9458.0" dur="4.72">even just the simple construction daniel</text><text start="9460.2" dur="5.01">did of as you&apos;re becoming more and more</text><text start="9462.72" dur="3.719">powerful as you become unlike and to god</text><text start="9465.21" dur="4.229">in the direction of destructive capacity</text><text start="9466.439" dur="4.531">if there&apos;s not an equivalent like unto</text><text start="9469.439" dur="3.451">god then in level of wisdom and care</text><text start="9470.97" dur="6.15">you&apos;re likely gonna [ __ ] things up real</text><text start="9472.89" dur="6.54">quick and we&apos;ve been through this many</text><text start="9477.12" dur="4.35">many times there&apos;s every construction</text><text start="9479.43" dur="4.86">you go through leads to the fact that we</text><text start="9481.47" dur="4.86">really don&apos;t have that much leeway we</text><text start="9484.29" dur="3.39">don&apos;t have that much time and the number</text><text start="9486.33" dur="4.26">of paths that are not in fact</text><text start="9487.68" dur="5.88">catastrophic are extremely narrow okay</text><text start="9490.59" dur="5.82">well hold that that&apos;s true</text><text start="9493.56" dur="4.35">hold that hold the energy and the degree</text><text start="9496.41" dur="3.989">to which that creates a motivational</text><text start="9497.91" dur="5.7">push to cause you to just do stuff that</text><text start="9500.399" dur="6.601">is hard at the same time have both</text><text start="9503.61" dur="4.8">humility and non-attachment yeah those</text><text start="9507.0" dur="3.57">the and committed at a level of</text><text start="9508.41" dur="4.86">intensity that&apos;s like way up there and</text><text start="9510.57" dur="5.39">not attached like that&apos;s the stuff that</text><text start="9513.27" dur="4.98">moves you to this point this singularity</text><text start="9515.96" dur="6.76">where the pop happens and the stage</text><text start="9518.25" dur="8.67">settles in yeah this is the being doing</text><text start="9522.72" dur="7.62">dialectic being grounded in a being that</text><text start="9526.92" dur="5.37">is actually full means unattached to</text><text start="9530.34" dur="6.11">needing fullness from the doing</text><text start="9532.29" dur="7.71">achieving a particular thing and yet</text><text start="9536.45" dur="6.01">like a way i think about it is there&apos;s a</text><text start="9540.0" dur="4.5">fullness of what is but i stopped</text><text start="9542.46" dur="5.01">thinking about reality as a noun and</text><text start="9544.5" dur="5.79">think about it as more verb like i can</text><text start="9547.47" dur="4.65">have a fullness with what is and they</text><text start="9550.29" dur="4.5">can also recognize an evolutionary</text><text start="9552.12" dur="4.41">trajectory i can recognize the beauty of</text><text start="9554.79" dur="3.75">life and be nourished by it and i can</text><text start="9556.53" dur="3.339">also know that it&apos;s mine to add to the</text><text start="9558.54" dur="7.339">beauty of life as best i can</text><text start="9559.869" dur="7.96">and that&apos;s
