dur="3.209">schmuck Dan Berger good to see you did</text><text start="7.56" dur="3.39">good to see you my friend thanks for</text><text start="9.179" dur="4.051">having us into your home I look forward</text><text start="10.95" dur="4.26">to this conversation thanks for thanks</text><text start="13.23" dur="5.1">for coming yeah we&apos;re gonna we&apos;re gonna</text><text start="15.21" dur="5.31">go deep here my friend so I&apos;m just gonna</text><text start="18.33" dur="3.72">jump right in a couple things that I&apos;ve</text><text start="20.52" dur="3.089">learned about you from reading about you</text><text start="22.05" dur="4.71">and listening to you on other shows is</text><text start="23.609" dur="5.49">that you were homeschooled that&apos;s true</text><text start="26.76" dur="5.04">and at the same time you&apos;re a really</text><text start="29.099" dur="5.491">bright guy who is very knowledgeable and</text><text start="31.8" dur="4.439">articulate I would consider you and I</text><text start="34.59" dur="3.899">don&apos;t throw this term around but I would</text><text start="36.239" dur="3.631">consider you to be someone that&apos;s highly</text><text start="38.489" dur="3.75">intelligent to the point where you could</text><text start="39.87" dur="4.2">be called brilliant and I don&apos;t call</text><text start="42.239" dur="2.521">everyone brilliant you&apos;re a really smart</text><text start="44.07" dur="3.03">guy</text><text start="44.76" dur="4.08">so why did your parents elect to</text><text start="47.1" dur="5.04">home-school you and what impact does</text><text start="48.84" dur="6.75">that had on your yeah on your you know a</text><text start="52.14" dur="5.009">mental acuity so it was a educational</text><text start="55.59" dur="4.5">experiment my parents were interested in</text><text start="57.149" dur="6.241">and my dad particularly spent his life</text><text start="60.09" dur="4.649">thinking about educational philosophy</text><text start="63.39" dur="3.69">and human potential and how do we</text><text start="64.739" dur="5.611">actually actualize human potential</text><text start="67.08" dur="4.92">better and my mom had shared interests</text><text start="70.35" dur="3.03">in different skills and so they they</text><text start="72.0" dur="4.11">decided to take it on together and the</text><text start="73.38" dur="4.83">experiment was what happens if we give a</text><text start="76.11" dur="4.71">kid no curriculum at all no fixed</text><text start="78.21" dur="4.92">curriculum so I didn&apos;t have English and</text><text start="80.82" dur="5.49">social studies in mathematics and but</text><text start="83.13" dur="5.34">just expose them to everything possible</text><text start="86.31" dur="5.73">facilitate their interests and see what</text><text start="88.47" dur="6.21">happens and so that was the experiment</text><text start="92.04" dur="4.41">and having gone through the whole</text><text start="94.68" dur="4.47">experiment we could do it much better</text><text start="96.45" dur="4.65">now there were parts that learned along</text><text start="99.15" dur="3.179">the way but the effective parts that I</text><text start="101.1" dur="8.519">would say we&apos;re a successful experiment</text><text start="102.329" dur="9.661">is every kid has profound fascination</text><text start="109.619" dur="4.941">with life in their own ways and we</text><text start="111.99" dur="4.65">usually do a good job of breaking it and</text><text start="114.56" dur="5.099">we also usually do a good job of</text><text start="116.64" dur="6.119">training them not to think well so</text><text start="119.659" dur="4.901">little kids ask what is that what is</text><text start="122.759" dur="3.0">that what is that at first right it&apos;s</text><text start="124.56" dur="3.899">the first question they&apos;re getting the</text><text start="125.759" dur="5.941">anatomy of universe down and then why</text><text start="128.459" dur="4.701">why why and the depth of why run into</text><text start="131.7" dur="3.05">philosophically and physically</text><text start="133.16" dur="3.96">need questions that we usually don&apos;t</text><text start="134.75" dur="3.96">know how to answer and so we give them</text><text start="137.12" dur="2.28">we just don&apos;t answer them or give them</text><text start="138.71" dur="4.23">[ __ ] answers</text><text start="139.4" dur="5.34">what made-up answers yes yeah but or</text><text start="142.94" dur="3.21">some less conscious parents who say</text><text start="144.74" dur="4.26">because I said so</text><text start="146.15" dur="4.17">yeah because it just is or God made it</text><text start="149.0" dur="3.87">that way or whatever so when ready to</text><text start="150.32" dur="3.99">asks why is the sky blue and most adults</text><text start="152.87" dur="3.33">realize they don&apos;t actually know</text><text start="154.31" dur="3.48">something that is that fundamental to</text><text start="156.2" dur="4.95">our experience every day right and all</text><text start="157.79" dur="5.37">human experience they either say I don&apos;t</text><text start="161.15" dur="3.45">know how do you spell cat right like to</text><text start="163.16" dur="2.54">move it into the domain of the gnome but</text><text start="164.6" dur="3.06">they move it from something that was</text><text start="165.7" dur="5.17">fundamental about the nature of universe</text><text start="167.66" dur="4.92">to something that wasn&apos;t and so if you</text><text start="170.87" dur="3.42">really want to explain why the sky is</text><text start="172.58" dur="4.17">blue you have to understand that our</text><text start="174.29" dur="4.11">upper atmosphere is made of nitrogen and</text><text start="176.75" dur="3.72">oxygen and the percentage of it and</text><text start="178.4" dur="4.23">nitrogen specifically as n2 and how</text><text start="180.47" dur="3.9">molecules work and how light coming from</text><text start="182.63" dur="3.12">the Sun works and the speed of light and</text><text start="184.37" dur="3.78">diffraction and understanding what</text><text start="185.75" dur="4.44">optics is and it like there&apos;s a lot of</text><text start="188.15" dur="3.84">deep things and then the wait that&apos;s why</text><text start="190.19" dur="3.6">it is that specific wavelength but why</text><text start="191.99" dur="3.24">do I subjectively experience it as blue</text><text start="193.79" dur="3.57">so now we&apos;re looking at the mind brain</text><text start="195.23" dur="3.9">interface right and the relationship</text><text start="197.36" dur="4.11">between consciousness and physics and</text><text start="199.13" dur="4.05">kids want to know that right they want</text><text start="201.47" dur="3.39">to know why is fire hot which again is a</text><text start="203.18" dur="4.29">[ __ ] deep question and they&apos;re like</text><text start="204.86" dur="4.23">every kid asks these things and since we</text><text start="207.47" dur="3.99">don&apos;t know we don&apos;t facilitate what</text><text start="209.09" dur="4.74">they&apos;re naturally fascinated in that it</text><text start="211.46" dur="3.99">passed me by and we force them to be</text><text start="213.83" dur="4.5">interested in stuff that is totally not</text><text start="215.45" dur="4.35">interesting and in doing so we don&apos;t</text><text start="218.33" dur="2.55">teach them the interesting things we</text><text start="219.8" dur="2.67">don&apos;t teach them the things that are</text><text start="220.88" dur="3.27">foundational about life that actually</text><text start="222.47" dur="3.57">lead to the ability to understand</text><text start="224.15" dur="3.69">everything else and we actually break</text><text start="226.04" dur="3.0">their interest in life which is why then</text><text start="227.84" dur="4.74">they just want to veg out and watch TV</text><text start="229.04" dur="5.88">or you know the the whole welfare person</text><text start="232.58" dur="3.95">phenomena who yeah is actually I was</text><text start="234.92" dur="4.8">gonna say they become great taxpayers</text><text start="236.53" dur="5.47">but see those are broken people that&apos;s</text><text start="239.72" dur="4.47">the key insight is that everyone is born</text><text start="242.0" dur="3.99">fascinated interested and if you</text><text start="244.19" dur="3.48">facilitate that then not only are you</text><text start="245.99" dur="3.57">helping them learn a tremendous amount</text><text start="247.67" dur="3.539">and you&apos;re and they&apos;re gonna be fussing</text><text start="249.56" dur="3.33">about different things some more in the</text><text start="251.209" dur="3.991">direction of aesthetics or ethics or</text><text start="252.89" dur="3.93">fundamental science or athletics or but</text><text start="255.2" dur="4.89">there will be a unique genius</text><text start="256.82" dur="4.74">actualization if it&apos;s followed and so</text><text start="260.09" dur="3.63">that was the experiment and we could go</text><text start="261.56" dur="4.72">on about educational philosophy but one</text><text start="263.72" dur="5.26">of the key like insights there is that</text><text start="266.28" dur="4.8">we have an educational system in the US</text><text start="268.98" dur="3.75">right now and in most of the West it was</text><text start="271.08" dur="5.1">built in the industrial revolution to</text><text start="272.73" dur="5.49">make industrial pots brand it was there</text><text start="276.18" dur="3.87">thank you no I love going here I was</text><text start="278.22" dur="3.24">hoping I&apos;d hoping we could get into this</text><text start="280.05" dur="5.52">so carry on please</text><text start="281.46" dur="6.81">and so as we started to look at building</text><text start="285.57" dur="5.34">industrial supply chains then we wanted</text><text start="288.27" dur="4.59">every assembly line worker before we had</text><text start="290.91" dur="3.69">automated that task to basically be</text><text start="292.86" dur="3.96">anatomica right they would do the exact</text><text start="294.6" dur="4.29">same thing and so anyone who had been</text><text start="296.82" dur="2.79">trained into doing that could be</text><text start="298.89" dur="2.25">replaceable</text><text start="299.61" dur="3.96">they were fungible for anyone else and</text><text start="301.14" dur="4.38">any MBA from a good business school was</text><text start="303.57" dur="3.96">replaceable for any other MBA any vp of</text><text start="305.52" dur="4.14">marketing and so we want to take unique</text><text start="307.53" dur="4.86">humans and collapse them into fungible</text><text start="309.66" dur="4.05">roles and so then we can just have an</text><text start="312.39" dur="2.76">org chart and say I&apos;m looking for three</text><text start="313.71" dur="3.78">of these and four of these totally</text><text start="315.15" dur="3.75">replaceable in the process of doing that</text><text start="317.49" dur="4.05">when you collapse the uniqueness of a</text><text start="318.9" dur="4.44">human into a fungible role there&apos;s of</text><text start="321.54" dur="4.59">course the intrinsic motive to do that</text><text start="323.34" dur="4.17">is gone deep competition in comparison</text><text start="326.13" dur="2.91">because we&apos;re competing on being the</text><text start="327.51" dur="2.85">exact same role so we&apos;re competing on</text><text start="329.04" dur="3.09">the same metrics rather than any</text><text start="330.36" dur="4.53">uniqueness like there&apos;s no way to</text><text start="332.13" dur="5.64">compare Salvador Dali and MC Escher and</text><text start="334.89" dur="4.65">DaVinci because how the [ __ ] would you</text><text start="337.77" dur="3.78">do that right like there you can&apos;t</text><text start="339.54" dur="4.49">compare them on the same metrics and if</text><text start="341.55" dur="4.59">like if Dali hadn&apos;t done what he did</text><text start="344.03" dur="3.55">some other artists wouldn&apos;t have done</text><text start="346.14" dur="3.36">the same thing universe would just have</text><text start="347.58" dur="3.45">been less that was the uniqueness of</text><text start="349.5" dur="3.21">that being expressing in a totally</text><text start="351.03" dur="2.94">[ __ ] unique way which is why all the</text><text start="352.71" dur="4.56">artists for history hadn&apos;t done that</text><text start="353.97" dur="5.55">thing and so so much of the jealousy and</text><text start="357.27" dur="4.44">the comparison competition also comes</text><text start="359.52" dur="3.84">from being collapsed to categories and</text><text start="361.71" dur="3.84">there were reasons why we did this as we</text><text start="363.36" dur="4.68">you know for all of human history until</text><text start="365.55" dur="4.619">not that long ago until the beginning of</text><text start="368.04" dur="3.84">what we call civilization ten thousand</text><text start="370.169" dur="3.781">years ago give or take for eight million</text><text start="371.88" dur="4.349">years of hominid history we never had</text><text start="373.95" dur="4.38">got more than 150 people and those</text><text start="376.229" dur="3.661">hundred and fifty person tribes every</text><text start="378.33" dur="3.51">one could be pretty unique and actually</text><text start="379.89" dur="3.089">get along well because they knew</text><text start="381.84" dur="2.94">everybody else and they could actually</text><text start="382.979" dur="3.961">keep track of it and as soon as you want</text><text start="384.78" dur="4.02">to go to start having very large numbers</text><text start="386.94" dur="3.66">we had to create some homogeneity</text><text start="388.8" dur="3.36">between everyone so we started making</text><text start="390.6" dur="3.629">them a lot more like termites or ants</text><text start="392.16" dur="4.02">which are animals that can do a lot of</text><text start="394.229" dur="3.211">them working together but within a class</text><text start="396.18" dur="2.91">a worker ant row</text><text start="397.44" dur="3.48">they&apos;re all fungible right they&apos;re all</text><text start="399.09" dur="3.39">replaceable for each other so this</text><text start="400.92" dur="3.51">system is very much like that in</text><text start="402.48" dur="3.69">education is the indoctrination and to</text><text start="404.43" dur="4.08">be going from a unique human to a</text><text start="406.17" dur="6.48">fungible boughten dude you just</text><text start="408.51" dur="6.21">described my hole in a very deeply</text><text start="412.65" dur="6.78">intellectual way my whole experience</text><text start="414.72" dur="7.17">subjectively with education and it the</text><text start="419.43" dur="4.02">whole time you&apos;re talking about caste</text><text start="421.89" dur="6.06">and this is why I do what I do because</text><text start="423.45" dur="6.54">I&apos;m so curious and so fascinated by by</text><text start="427.95" dur="5.31">the way things work and what they the</text><text start="429.99" dur="7.07">questions of why right and so I was</text><text start="433.26" dur="6.96">always seeking truth even as a kid like</text><text start="437.06" dur="5.05">how does this work why does it work but</text><text start="440.22" dur="4.59">the system that I was put into and</text><text start="442.11" dur="5.4">literally physically the desks I was put</text><text start="444.81" dur="4.95">into we&apos;re like little torture chambers</text><text start="447.51" dur="6.84">and and my creativity was actually</text><text start="449.76" dur="7.02">discouraged and and was you know almost</text><text start="454.35" dur="3.84">forced you know forced to join the</text><text start="456.78" dur="3.03">basketball team because I was having</text><text start="458.19" dur="3.12">behavioral problems and their solution</text><text start="459.81" dur="2.58">was like cool make him conform to</text><text start="461.31" dur="2.85">something that makes him even more</text><text start="462.39" dur="3.42">insecure and feel like even more of an</text><text start="464.16" dur="3.9">outsider being the kid with the long</text><text start="465.81" dur="4.29">hair and refusing to wear the right</text><text start="468.06" dur="3.96">shoes so I wore my vans and slid around</text><text start="470.1" dur="3.54">the court and got made fun of and you</text><text start="472.02" dur="4.23">know harassed and picked on and stuff</text><text start="473.64" dur="4.56">like that and it&apos;s like once I turned</text><text start="476.25" dur="3.81">the day turned 18 I quit high school I</text><text start="478.2" dur="3.54">was marking it off on my calendar like a</text><text start="480.06" dur="3.51">prisoner you know putting notches on the</text><text start="481.74" dur="5.13">wall is like marking the calendar talk</text><text start="483.57" dur="5.58">tober 29th 1988 and that was the day of</text><text start="486.87" dur="4.23">freedom and from that moment on once I</text><text start="489.15" dur="4.47">left school then I became obsessed with</text><text start="491.1" dur="4.47">learning and so it&apos;s so interesting to</text><text start="493.62" dur="4.41">look from the standpoint of your</text><text start="495.57" dur="4.98">perspective because it wasn&apos;t that I</text><text start="498.03" dur="5.25">didn&apos;t want to learn it&apos;s that I didn&apos;t</text><text start="500.55" dur="5.82">want to learn that way that those topics</text><text start="503.28" dur="5.01">those topics and that way yes and so now</text><text start="506.37" dur="4.65">it&apos;s like you know here I&apos;m 47 and I&apos;m</text><text start="508.29" dur="5.79">like I&apos;m like the most curious child</text><text start="511.02" dur="4.44">like energy I think there is I mean I</text><text start="514.08" dur="2.94">don&apos;t know anyone that&apos;s as curious is</text><text start="515.46" dur="2.79">me about the way things work and it&apos;s</text><text start="517.02" dur="3.48">such a gift to be able to interview</text><text start="518.25" dur="5.43">people yeah and and really learn about</text><text start="520.5" dur="4.95">this stuff so so that&apos;s so no note how</text><text start="523.68" dur="3.96">fortuitous that your parents you know</text><text start="525.45" dur="4.26">you were so situated that your parents</text><text start="527.64" dur="2.34">got that right you had an opportunity to</text><text start="529.71" dur="2.85">take</text><text start="529.98" dur="6.39">different paths now is because you</text><text start="532.56" dur="5.85">didn&apos;t actually identify you you didn&apos;t</text><text start="536.37" dur="3.75">actually succeed at school in that way</text><text start="538.41" dur="2.4">that you were able to actually do</text><text start="540.12" dur="2.07">something else</text><text start="540.81" dur="3.029">to the degree you succeed at it then</text><text start="542.19" dur="4.29">you&apos;re trapped by the continuation of</text><text start="543.839" dur="4.68">that curve forever so notice the smarter</text><text start="546.48" dur="4.43">the kids are smart meaning good at that</text><text start="548.519" dur="4.201">particular definition of smart the</text><text start="550.91" dur="2.77">earlier we push them in the</text><text start="552.72" dur="2.489">hyperspecialization</text><text start="553.68" dur="3.42">right we want to get them in AP classes</text><text start="555.209" dur="2.911">towards their specialty young and then</text><text start="557.1" dur="3.09">the further we push them in</text><text start="558.12" dur="4.589">specialization so by the time they do</text><text start="560.19" dur="3.69">their dissertation 10 people in the</text><text start="562.709" dur="3.391">world know what the [ __ ] they&apos;re talking</text><text start="563.88" dur="4.319">about so they know so much about such a</text><text start="566.1" dur="3.87">narrow area so they&apos;re not thinking</text><text start="568.199" dur="4.111">about big picture things or thing</text><text start="569.97" dur="6.21">interdisciplinary things at all that</text><text start="572.31" dur="6.32">means that the smartest people aren&apos;t</text><text start="576.18" dur="4.29">actually questioning macroeconomics and</text><text start="578.63"

dur="5.88">dumb enough so what is really happening</text><text start="702.94" dur="8.61">think about this if the kid who gets a</text><text start="706.66" dur="8.07">4.0 one of the keys of getting a 4.0 is</text><text start="711.55" dur="4.89">making no mistakes right like that&apos;s how</text><text start="714.73" dur="2.97">you that&apos;s how you write that is that</text><text start="716.44" dur="3.72">you need everything right and everything</text><text start="717.7" dur="4.02">perfect now everything right means you</text><text start="720.16" dur="3.48">learned what had already been

dur="3.69">then at a certain point once you</text><text start="729.52" dur="3.96">understand that system completely enough</text><text start="731.14" dur="5.25">you can extend it a little bit which you</text><text start="733.48" dur="6.18">know in the postdoc level you take the</text><text start="736.39" dur="5.04">current whatever the field is an</text><text start="739.66" dur="3.41">extended a tiny bit after proving that</text><text start="741.43" dur="5.94">you understood it you know perfectly</text><text start="743.07" dur="6.25">people who got a lot of praise and a lot</text><text

oriented to</text><text start="754.18" dur="3.72">do things that have a very high risk of</text><text start="755.71" dur="7.11">failure that&apos;s great</text><text start="757.9" dur="7.08">so true so when when kids are praised</text><text start="762.82" dur="5.97">for getting things right you [ __ ] them</text><text start="764.98" dur="6.18">up because a number of things one so</text><text start="768.79" dur="4.92">think about this in general all the</text><text start="771.16" dur="4.32">praise that kids get is when they do</text><text start="773.71" dur="3.93">something that the authority wants them</text><text start="775.48" dur="3.81">to do and has already designated as</text><text start="777.64" dur="2.85">right and good and true right so whether</text><text start="779.29" dur="3.6">it&apos;s the teacher the preacher of the</text><text start="780.49" dur="3.81">parents they get praised for doing what</text><text start="782.89" dur="3.39">someone else wanted them to do they</text><text start="784.3" dur="3.51">almost always get punishment for doing</text><text start="786.28" dur="3.39">things that made sense to them that they</text><text start="787.81" dur="5.57">wanted to do so this is how you</text><text start="789.67" dur="6.17">conditioned people to be</text><text start="793.38" dur="4.92">well you know cogs within an</text><text start="795.84" dur="4.86">authoritarian system where we defer our</text><text start="798.3" dur="4.83">own agency our ability to assess the</text><text start="800.7" dur="4.59">world in our own agency to somebody that</text><text start="803.13" dur="3.18">knows better than us and the teacher the</text><text start="805.29" dur="3.15">preacher the parent right they all</text><text start="806.31" dur="6.15">represent that and then it becomes the</text><text start="808.44" dur="7.38">boss and the you know macroeconomy the</text><text start="812.46" dur="7.35">state the etc writ large and so if we</text><text start="815.82" dur="6.0">want people that actually can really be</text><text start="819.81" dur="4.5">innovative we can&apos;t train them that way</text><text start="821.82" dur="5.82">we have to train them to self assess and</text><text start="824.31" dur="5.13">self initiate and not actually get hits</text><text start="827.64" dur="4.08">of praise from getting something right</text><text start="829.44" dur="3.84">that others already figured out and when</text><text start="831.72" dur="3.51">we do that like oftentimes there&apos;s a kid</text><text start="833.28" dur="4.65">who becomes a Spelling Bee champion or</text><text start="835.23" dur="4.38">math genius because they just happen to</text><text start="837.93" dur="3.3">[ __ ] figure out like how spelling</text><text start="839.61" dur="3.72">works or how math works and they got so</text><text start="841.23" dur="3.39">much praise for it and they weren&apos;t</text><text start="843.33" dur="3.72">getting enough unconditional love</text><text start="844.62" dur="5.22">otherwise that they were optimizing for</text><text start="847.05" dur="5.16">the extrinsic reward associated with the</text><text start="849.84" dur="4.71">math of getting the prey is even though</text><text start="852.21" dur="3.75">they might actually hate math or be not</text><text start="854.55"

alright but</text><text start="860.52" dur="3.06">they&apos;re actually fascinated by art and</text><text start="861.87" dur="3.81">so then they can become very good at</text><text start="863.58" dur="4.44">something they have no passion for and</text><text start="865.68" dur="6.9">it&apos;s all based on extrinsic motive that</text><text start="868.02" dur="5.1">is damaging intrinsic motive why do you</text><text start="872.58" dur="3.66">have kids</text><text start="873.12" dur="5.22">I don&apos;t have kids like you get great dad</text><text start="876.24" dur="4.56">dude I was picturing your kid man</text><text start="878.34" dur="4.44">they&apos;re gonna be so well developed if</text><text start="880.8" dur="2.61">and when you have them I don&apos;t I don&apos;t I</text><text start="882.78" dur="2.79">don&apos;t either</text><text start="883.41" dur="5.46">and I think partially because I&apos;m like</text><text start="885.57" dur="4.86">terrified of not doing

there&apos;s so many</text><text start="949.67" dur="3.45">things I want to cover with you but the</text><text start="951.53" dur="2.79">education thing definitely piqued my</text><text start="953.12"

there&apos;s this just where we</text><text start="989.51" dur="5.34">are culturally is so interesting because</text><text start="991.28" dur="5.12">this millennial generation I read</text><text start="994.85" dur="3.9">something the other day for example that</text><text start="996.4" dur="5.17">they surveyed a bunch of Millennials and</text><text start="998.75" dur="5.52">50% of them

start="1005.55" dur="6.43">post-modernism and and Marxist ideas and</text><text start="1009.88" dur="4.29">all this to me really crazy stuff that</text><text start="1011.98" dur="3.96">this seemed to have seeped its way into</text><text start="1014.17" dur="3.9">higher education and you have this</text><text start="1015.94" dur="5.01">generation of kids that are in this</text><text start="1018.07"

carried on</text><text start="1040.089" dur="6.301">alright that&apos;s it like quite a few</text><text start="1043.18" dur="6.81">really deep topics mixed together and</text><text start="1046.39" dur="5.01">unwound yeah so post-modernism as one</text><text start="1049.99" dur="2.04">topic in its relationship to higher</text><text start="1051.4" dur="3.0">education</text><text start="1052.03" dur="3.43">okay the trend of higher education writ</text><text start="1054.4" dur="3.73">large and the other issue</text><text start="1055.46" dur="5.31">beyond post-modernism looking at macro</text><text start="1058.13" dur="4.41">economy and questioning capitalism and</text><text start="1060.77" dur="4.26">looking at other macroeconomic systems</text><text start="1062.54"

you know I&apos;m very</text><text start="1079.13" dur="3.9">zoomed out and I&apos;m looking at things</text><text start="1080.72" dur="4.14">that I see like that like we kids don&apos;t</text><text start="1083.03" dur="3.99">understand communism doesn&apos;t work how</text><text start="1084.86" dur="4.89">did we get there you know it&apos;s just it&apos;s</text><text start="1087.02" dur="4.65">so bizarre to me in this whole I don&apos;t</text><text start="1089.75" dur="4.35">know the climate of so there&apos;s free</text><text start="1091.67" dur="4.47">speech being crushed

dur="6.6">thing okay so the issue as I see it is</text><text start="1103.55" dur="4.32">actually quite nuanced and complex and</text><text start="1105.74" dur="6.3">most of the reactionary simplistic takes</text><text start="1107.87" dur="6.63">on it are part of the problem so let&apos;s</text><text start="1112.04" dur="6.15">explore this nuance all right cool so</text><text start="1114.5" dur="4.98">let&apos;s take em the issue of race okay</text><text start="1118.19" dur="3.33">which is right at the heart of that</text><text start="1119.48" dur="5.7">topic we can make it race we can look at</text><text start="1121.52" dur="5.43">gender we can look at transgender LGBTQ</text><text start="1125.18" dur="4.17">we can look at any of those dynamics</text><text start="1126.95" dur="3.87">that are part of the the identity</text><text start="1129.35" dur="5.13">politics part you&apos;re bringing up right</text><text start="1130.82" dur="6.39">now this is related to post-modernism</text><text start="1134.48" dur="4.41">and it derives some of its intellectual</text><text start="1137.21" dur="4.17">basis from post-modernism but it&apos;s also</text><text start="1138.89" dur="4.11">related to some other key things so if</text><text start="1141.38" dur="3.6">we look at race and we look at black</text><text start="1143.0" dur="11.1">lives matter or

not</text><text start="1571.679" dur="3.181">all going to be equally true some of</text><text start="1573.36" dur="2.97">them can have distortion in them so we</text><text start="1574.86" dur="3.87">need to be able to bet for distortion</text><text start="1576.33" dur="5.12">and all the perspectives are going to be</text><text start="1578.73" dur="5.579">less different in simpler

because of everything you just</text><text start="2596.18" dur="6.14">described so is this just a set of</text><text start="2599.96" dur="4.32">principles then going to just take that</text><text start="2602.32" dur="4.09">addiction away know what it&apos;s going to</text><text start="2604.28" dur="4.26">do is it&apos;s going to give me a framework</text><text start="2606.41" dur="4.14">to

start="2615.349" dur="4.681">then the need for that thing that I was</text><text start="2617.39" dur="4.17">using goes away and it&apos;s the straight I</text><text start="2620.03" dur="3.78">mean

time</text><text start="2697.28" dur="6.01">now just because this is adjacent to a</text><text start="2700.38" dur="4.71">topic I want to discuss this is one of</text><text start="2703.29" dur="4.38">the things that is most gruesome about</text><text start="2705.09" dur="5.7">social media and I&apos;ll say most gruesome</text><text start="2707.67" dur="5.4">about the topic of personal

dur="6.65">with this a lot so I&apos;m looking forward</text><text start="2717.24" dur="10.47">to what you have to say when someone</text><text start="2722.51" dur="7.06">creates a brand as a business but even</text><text start="2727.71" dur="3.3">if not they&apos;re just social media and</text><text start="2729.57" dur="3.11">there&apos;s a persona right but let&apos;s take</text><text start="2731.01" dur="4.35">the brand as a very clear example</text><text start="2732.68" dur="4.09">they&apos;re now a life coach there are yoga</text><text start="2735.36" dur="3.42">teacher they&apos;re an Instagram model but</text><text start="2736.77" dur="3.99">whatever the [ __ ] it is right which has</text><text start="2738.78" dur="3.27">become radically easier there used to be</text><text start="2740.76" dur="3.27">a few people too that would based on the</text><text start="2742.05" dur="4.86">media tech now everybody gets it to some</text><text start="2744.03" dur="5.25">degree of this then what happens is I</text><text start="2746.91" dur="3.87">have a feed background an analytics</text><text start="2749.28" dur="3.57">mechanism of how much people like my</text><text start="2750.78" dur="4.32">persona which is how many likes the</text><text start="2752.85" dur="3.99">thing gets and how many clicks and</text><text start="2755.1" dur="4.71">impressions and purchases whatever you</text><text start="2756.84" dur="5.31">know thing and so I&apos;m going to now split</text><text start="2759.81" dur="3.45">test optimize my persona based on what</text><text start="2762.15" dur="2.52">people are responding to and they&apos;re</text><text start="2763.26" dur="6.45">gonna respond the hyper normal stimuli</text><text start="2764.67" dur="7.56">and so the brand is going to get based</text><text start="2769.71" dur="4.47">on the financial driver based on the</text><text start="2772.23" dur="2.64">analytics is going to evolve in the</text><text start="2774.18" dur="1.98">direction of</text><text start="2774.87" dur="2.64">it&apos;s maximum engagement it&apos;s gonna get</text><text start="2776.16" dur="3.45">further and further from who I actually</text><text start="2777.51" dur="3.78">am there will be whole areas of who I am</text><text start="2779.61" dur="3.36">that I definitely don&apos;t share

dur="3.48">people are liking that thing now that I</text><text start="2788.49" dur="4.68">feel different than the more depressed I</text><text start="2790.23" dur="4.89">feel right the more addictive desire I</text><text start="2793.17" dur="4.2">have in that depression let&apos;s go ready</text><text start="2795.12" dur="5.07">hit right and put out another [ __ ]</text><text start="2797.37" dur="4.92">thing that&apos;s gonna get a likes and the</text><text start="2800.19" dur="3.27">more I feel like a fraud and a phony and</text><text start="2802.29" dur="2.07">that if anyone really saw me they</text><text start="2803.46" dur="3.12">wouldn&apos;t love me and I&apos;m really</text><text start="2804.36" dur="3.63">unlovable and etc right so in the</text><text start="2806.58" dur="3.33">12-step room the opposite of that&apos;s</text><text start="2807.99" dur="4.26">happening right someone is actually</text><text start="2809.91" dur="3.96">saying I&apos;m a [ __ ] [ __ ] up

dur="5.4">be the basis it&apos;s not sufficient right</text><text start="2825.99" dur="4.59">but it starts to be the basis of a human</text><text start="2828.93" dur="3.69">life that doesn&apos;t drive addiction as a</text><text start="2830.58" dur="4.71">way to deal with the emptiness right</text><text start="2832.62" dur="5.31">remove the emptiness and then the need</text><text start="2835.29" dur="3.99">to run from it goes away it&apos;s</text><text start="2837.93" dur="4.17">interesting though as you were talking</text><text start="2839.28" dur="4.98">about the social media persona and the</text><text start="2842.1" dur="3.72">profile because I&apos;ve owned a company for</text><text start="2844.26" dur="4.08">nine years and it&apos;s it&apos;s a company

then we&apos;re gonna create</text><text start="4155.12" dur="4.53">dependence and addiction and so these</text><text start="4157.37" dur="3.96">were the things that I saw was a scaling</text><text start="4159.65" dur="4.23">amount of dependence and addiction and</text><text start="4161.33" dur="4.259">very narrow positives with a lot of the</text><text start="4163.88" dur="4.2">positives that

start="4170.06" dur="4.949">people in a in an integrative medical</text><text start="4172.1" dur="4.71">clinical environment - when we had their</text><text start="4175.009" dur="4.321">genomics we had their blood labs we had</text><text start="4176.81" dur="4.11">brain scans to customize chemistry that</text><text start="4179.33" dur="3.659">helped them tremendously so we knew we</text><text start="4180.92" dur="3.839">can do that and then question was can we</text><text start="4182.989" dur="2.52">do that at scale without personalization</text><text start="4184.759" dur="2.25">which I didn&apos;t know because</text><text start="4185.509" dur="2.821">personalization is a big deal and we&apos;re</text><text start="4187.009" dur="4.08">working towards methods to build a</text><text

personalized they&apos;re so different</text><text start="4194.51" dur="3.51">person-to-person so alright right we</text><text start="4196.489" dur="3.69">don&apos;t have any type of folate or

dur="2.55">makes such a really big difference there</text><text start="4203.3" dur="2.58">right we just don&apos;t [ __ ] with that</text><text start="4204.38" dur="3.78">access if we can&apos;t personalize that yeah</text><text start="4205.88" dur="4.23">but there are a lot of axes that</text><text start="4208.16" dur="3.84">everyone who is self selecting into a</text><text start="4210.11" dur="3.48">particular kind of thing like something</text><text start="4212.0" dur="3.78">for cognitive enhancement do pretty well</text><text start="4213.59" dur="5.879">across the whole board so you know high</text><text start="4215.78" dur="5.13">success and well tolerated so what we</text><text start="4219.469" dur="3.061">wanted to do with quality was say can we</text><text start="4220.91" dur="3.53">make an alternative so that people don&apos;t</text><text start="4222.53" dur="5.419">have to go to just a tremendous amount</text><text start="4224.44" dur="5.52">caffeine or off-label smart drugs or</text><text start="4227.949" dur="3.661">just suffer without the ability to focus</text><text start="4229.96" dur="2.58">they will actually help them in what</text><text start="4231.61" dur="3.0">they&apos;re looking for</text><text start="4232.54" dur="4.56">with enough subjective effect that they</text><text start="4234.61" dur="5.01">actually feel it and that will actually</text><text start="4237.1" dur="5.22">have a much wider host of positive</text><text start="4239.62" dur="5.04">effects that we&apos;re getting focusing</text><text start="4242.32" dur="4.169">concentration and drive but also</text><text start="4244.66" dur="3.84">emotional resilience and task switching</text><text start="4246.489" dur="4.171">and creativity and analysis and</text><text start="4248.5" dur="4.65">synthesis and you know so we we started</text><text start="4250.66" dur="4.38">by doing a a kind of cognitive map of</text><text start="4253.15" dur="3.39">what are all of the states and all of</text><text start="4255.04" dur="2.76">the capacities that people are looking</text><text start="4256.54" dur="3.78">for when they were they wanting to do</text><text start="4257.8" dur="4.919">productive work and then saying what are</text><text start="4260.32" dur="3.75">the underlying physiologic pathways that</text><text start="4262.719" dur="4.23">mediate those that we know about from</text><text start="4264.07" dur="6.08">the various neuro scientific and</text><text start="4266.949" dur="6.211">bioscience fields and then can we</text><text start="4270.15" dur="4.69">understand how those systems work so how</text><text start="4273.16" dur="2.97">does the body regulate dopamine so you</text><text start="4274.84" dur="2.879">know as you start to look at you say</text><text start="4276.13" dur="3.3">alright so protein comes in dietarily</text><text start="4277.719" dur="4.23">gets broken down to amino acids</text><text start="4279.43" dur="4.35">phenylalanine converts into tyrosine</text><text start="4281.949" dur="3.181">converts to n acetyl tyrosine converts</text><text start="4283.78" dur="3.51">to l-dopa crosses the blood-brain</text><text start="4285.13" dur="4.589">barrier converts to dopamine and a</text><text start="4287.29" dur="5.25">presynaptic neuron transport a protein</text><text start="4289.719" dur="4.651">down an axon crosses a synapse has to</text><text start="4292.54" dur="3.69">get by synaptic enzymes that will break</text><text start="4294.37" dur="4.829">it down in different ways hydroxylase</text><text start="4296.23" dur="4.23">and they may OB and CMT and etc and then</text><text start="4299.199" dur="1.921">goes into one of a few dopamine</text><text start="4300.46" dur="2.64">receptors</text><text start="4301.12" dur="3.36">there&apos;s inter cellular dynamics that are</text><text start="4303.1" dur="2.97">involved so you just start to look at</text><text start="4304.48" dur="4.38">that and say how does the body do this</text><text start="4306.07" dur="4.649">thing on its own and are there</text><text start="4308.86" dur="4.379">deficiencies in any of those key</text><text start="4310.719" dur="5.191">nutrients or transform factors or things</text><text start="4313.239" dur="5.25">that are oftentimes under fully</text><text start="4315.91" dur="4.2">supported that we can support and that</text><text start="4318.489" dur="3.181">would be just looking at dopamine right</text><text start="4320.11" dur="3.95">then you do that with acetylcholine when</text><text start="4321.67" dur="5.22">you look at glutamate then you look at</text><text start="4324.06" dur="4.42">functions like neurogenesis but is</text><text start="4326.89" dur="2.79">continuously developing new neurons are</text><text start="4328.48" dur="3.03">there things that actually support</text><text start="4329.68" dur="4.26">increased neurogenesis or neuro etaf</text><text start="4331.51" dur="5.459">that gee killing old neurons better so</text><text start="4333.94" dur="4.2">you don&apos;t have senescence so we looked</text><text start="4336.969" dur="3.961">at what are the host of things people</text><text start="4338.14" dur="4.59">are looking for there are healthy states</text><text start="4340.93" dur="3.48">and capacities what is the underlying</text><text start="4342.73" dur="3.719">physiology involved how does that</text><text start="4344.41" dur="3.69">physiology naturally regulate and what</text><text start="4346.449" dur="3.961">what what might we be able to do to</text><text start="4348.1" dur="5.099">support the natural regulatory systems</text><text start="4350.41" dur="5.1">so that people both have a more complete</text><text start="4353.199" dur="4.201">positive state and that rather than</text><text start="4355.51" dur="2.669">create dependence right there on it for</text><text start="4357.4" dur="2.849">a while</text><text start="4358.179" dur="4.141">overrode their regulatory system and now</text><text start="4360.249" dur="3.631">there&apos;s addiction that it actually is</text><text start="4362.32" dur="2.94">supporting the robustness of the</text><text start="4363.88" dur="1.92">regulatory system so that when they get</text><text start="4365.26" dur="2.429">off it</text><text start="4365.8" dur="4.949">there is elevation from baseline that</text><text start="4367.689" dur="4.29">lasts right the exact opposite side</text><text start="4370.749" dur="4.531">effect in the exact opposite of</text><text start="4371.979" dur="5.49">dependence so that was our goal and so</text><text start="4375.28" dur="4.319">we did hundreds of iterations bunch of</text><text start="4377.469" dur="4.17">testing you know after doing full litter</text><text start="4379.599" dur="3.451">to review database of five hundred no</text><text start="4381.639" dur="2.73">tropic chemicals and looking at the</text><text start="4383.05" dur="2.879">pathways of them and then looking at</text><text start="4384.369" dur="4.29">positive synergies negative synergies</text><text start="4385.929" dur="5.101">delivery mechanisms and we ended up</text><text start="4388.659" dur="5.121">getting to this formula</text><text start="4391.03" dur="5.37">you know that&apos;s there right now which</text><text start="4393.78" dur="5.02">over a large enough number of people</text><text start="4396.4" dur="3.989">over a large enough amount of time</text><text start="4398.8" dur="3.839">tested well enough that we were actually</text><text start="4400.389" dur="4.23">really happy with it and so that&apos;s that</text><text start="4402.639" dur="4.05">first product and that the goal there</text><text start="4404.619" dur="5.04">was to be able to support people having</text><text start="4406.689" dur="4.62">increased productive capacity rate</text><text start="4409.659" dur="3.241">increased cognitive clarity and the</text><text start="4411.309" dur="5.88">associated emotional states like</text><text start="4412.9" dur="8.039">resilience and and drive that was</text><text start="4417.189" dur="5.55">actually not bad for people and good for</text><text start="4420.939" dur="3.421">people now I can&apos;t claim that we know</text><text start="4422.739" dur="3.36">that because we haven&apos;t done long enough</text><text start="4424.36" dur="4.139">term trials with enough metrics with</text><text start="4426.099" dur="4.471">enough controls to claim all that but</text><text start="4428.499" dur="3.571">you know we&apos;ve done preclinical trials</text><text start="4430.57" dur="3.54">with pre and post brain scans and</text><text start="4432.07" dur="5.19">biometrics and seen you know really</text><text start="4434.11" dur="6.179">meaningful statistical correlations and</text><text start="4437.26" dur="5.279">we&apos;ve had I don&apos;t forty thousand people</text><text start="4440.289" dur="6.091">over three years we&apos;re collecting data</text><text start="4442.539" dur="6.511">from what their experience is really so</text><text start="4446.38" dur="4.139">we we&apos;re very happy about that and</text><text start="4449.05" dur="3.75">that&apos;s the first car that didn&apos;t you</text><text start="4450.519" dur="4.531">know what it kind of is is a complex</text><text start="4452.8" dur="4.319">approach because her brain is a complex</text><text start="4455.05" dur="3.389">system embodies a complex system so</text><text start="4457.119" dur="3.27">rather than here&apos;s one molecule to</text><text start="4458.439" dur="3.51">override it it&apos;s how does it</text><text start="4460.389" dur="3.63">self-regulate and can we support it</text><text start="4461.949" dur="4.92">self-regulation across many related axes</text><text start="4464.019" dur="4.051">now if we were gonna approach anxiety we</text><text start="4466.869" dur="4.02">would do it the same way if we were</text><text start="4468.07" dur="6.509">gonna approach pain rather than you know</text><text start="4470.889" dur="4.891">just some end set or opiate we do it the</text><text start="4474.579" dur="3.6">same way how does the body naturally</text><text start="4475.78" dur="4.04">produce its own opiates how does it</text><text start="4478.179" dur="4.011">naturally deal with inflammation</text><text start="4479.82" dur="3.569">and can we support those dynamics if</text><text start="4482.19" dur="6.389">we&apos;re gonna work with sleep we go to the</text><text start="4483.389" dur="6.21">same way so those are things I like I</text><text start="4488.579" dur="3.181">can&apos;t wait to see what you guys are</text><text start="4489.599" dur="4.02">coming up with next so there&apos;s a couple</text><text start="4491.76" dur="5.1">of things in there that I really like is</text><text start="4493.619" dur="5.79">that you guys really were very</text><text start="4496.86" dur="4.23">thoughtful about the synergy between the</text><text start="4499.409" dur="3.301">different compounds I think there&apos;s a</text><text start="4501.09" dur="3.149">lot of cowboys and Indians right now in</text><text start="4502.71" dur="4.04">the nootropic spaces I&apos;m sure you&apos;re</text><text start="4504.239" dur="4.65">aware where you see the same kind of</text><text start="4506.75" dur="3.76">formulations on 10 different products</text><text start="4508.889" dur="3.121">and it&apos;s like one guy just looked at</text><text start="4510.51" dur="3.899">what the next guys doing on a label oh</text><text start="4512.01" dur="4.41">yeah here that&apos;s good for short-term</text><text start="4514.409" dur="3.361">memory focus cognition whatever blah</text><text start="4516.42" dur="4.17">blah and they just kind of throw those</text><text start="4517.77" dur="4.98">stacks out there without necessarily for</text><text start="4520.59" dur="3.48">thought as to how those interact with</text><text start="4522.75" dur="4.199">one another right so you have one</text><text start="4524.07" dur="4.62">molecule and it does one thing and let&apos;s</text><text start="4526.949" dur="3.63">just even say that that that effect of</text><text start="4528.69" dur="2.94">that molecule is universal and you&apos;re</text><text start="4530.579" dur="2.611">choosing ones that are kind of</text><text start="4531.63" dur="3.69">universally affecting people in the same</text><text start="4533.19" dur="3.719">way but then you combine that with other</text><text start="4535.32" dur="2.49">molecules another one&apos;s another ones and</text><text start="4536.909" dur="3.75">now you have something totally different</text><text start="4537.81" dur="5.76">you have a third party compound now</text><text start="4540.659" dur="5.371">right and so that can go well or not</text><text start="4543.57" dur="5.069">based on self experimentation there&apos;s</text><text start="4546.03" dur="3.93">been times where I&apos;ve you know taken too</text><text start="4548.639" dur="3.511">many different things at the same time</text><text start="4549.96" dur="4.139">and too much of them and I&apos;m having the</text><text start="4552.15" dur="4.41">opposite effect where I can&apos;t focus and</text><text start="4554.099" dur="4.56">I&apos;m actually feel like I&apos;m freaking nuts</text><text start="4556.56" dur="4.44">because I took too many smart drugs or</text><text start="4558.659" dur="4.591">whatever I overdosed on yohimbe wants</text><text start="4561.0" dur="4.8">for example just random like don&apos;t do</text><text start="4563.25" dur="4.77">that kids at home you know pay attention</text><text start="4565.8" dur="4.799">to the the dosage and stuff but I think</text><text start="4568.02" dur="4.079">what&apos;s cool about qualia is that you</text><text start="4570.599" dur="2.161">really looked at how things relate to</text><text start="4572.099" dur="2.911">one another</text><text start="4572.76" dur="3.419">that you&apos;re not putting anything in</text><text start="4575.01" dur="3.75">there that&apos;s gonna cause your body to</text><text start="4576.179" dur="4.261">down regulate its own production we&apos;re</text><text start="4578.76" dur="3.93">to the point where there&apos;s a dependency</text><text start="4580.44" dur="4.17">and oh my god now I can&apos;t make this</text><text start="4582.69" dur="3.719">neurotransmitter or whatever because</text><text start="4584.61" dur="5.79">I&apos;ve it&apos;s been done for me for so long</text><text start="4586.409" dur="6.0">and then also I did the whole basis of</text><text start="4590.4" dur="3.569">it is coming from what I like about the</text><text start="4592.409" dur="3.98">company itself is that it&apos;s coming

ago and I was</text><text start="4605.099" dur="5.1">in Colorado and I had to speak at two</text><text start="4607.53" dur="5.21">events and they were pretty substantial</text><text start="4610.199" dur="5.271">for me and I was so</text><text start="4612.74" dur="5.16">and I didn&apos;t I could not make myself be</text><text start="4615.47" dur="5.34">in a good mood like I literally just</text><text start="4617.9" dur="4.44">couldn&apos;t be happy you know it&apos;s just I</text><text start="4620.81" dur="3.3">was just depressed and even though my</text><text start="4622.34"

dur="5.13">down-regulation piece is that when I</text><text start="4734.27" dur="4.8">started I took the full dose I think it</text><text start="4737.24" dur="3.96">was three of number one and six of</text><text start="4739.07" dur="3.39">number two and I did that a lot and it</text><text start="4741.2" dur="3.15">kind of just brought me up to a nice</text><text start="4742.46" dur="3.219">base

dur="2.79">in you build the tolerance you need more</text><text start="4768.269" dur="2.491">and more and then your body forgets how</text><text start="4769.559" dur="3.12">to make it and you end up

all right so that&apos;s very good</text><text start="4844.439" dur="5.941">from a lifetime revenue point of view</text><text start="4846.329" dur="6.571">and if it creates side effects did need</text><text start="4850.38" dur="5.94">other drugs to resolve them that&apos;s</text><text start="4852.9" dur="5.789">called a cross seller and a perfect and</text><text start="4856.32" dur="3.389">then if to maximize lifetime value I</text><text start="4858.689" dur="3.47">want to start them as young as possible</text><text start="4859.709" dur="5.631">so we make up new diseases like a TD</text><text start="4862.159" dur="6.46">after we put two ritalin shitty</text><text start="4865.34" dur="5.17">desks and so they still make those desks</text><text start="4868.619"

dur="3.36">if it causes addiction we want to create</text><text start="4882.49" dur="2.91">a long-term benefit because the side</text><text start="4884.35" dur="2.52">effects you want the side effects

was hard for</text><text start="4907.75" dur="2.55">us because and is why we started with</text><text start="4909.01" dur="2.61">supplement as opposed to bigger things</text><text start="4910.3" dur="4.59">we could have done is because I didn&apos;t</text><text start="4911.62" dur="6.0">want to take capital from any financial</text><text start="4914.89" dur="4.44">service places that would then bind us</text><text start="4917.62" dur="3.93">to doing things were unethical so like</text><text start="4919.33" dur="3.87">our right our cost of goods to make</text><text start="4921.55"

not filler</text><text start="4936.37" dur="3.93">it&apos;s because it just takes that much of</text><text start="4937.99" dur="3.93">those things it&apos;s just expensive no and</text><text start="4940.3" dur="3.42">also the fact that you guys aren&apos;t using</text><text start="4941.92" dur="3.3">excipient sand binders and all that</text><text start="4943.72" dur="3.39">weird stuff which I always notice right</text><text start="4945.22" dur="3.72">away I&apos;m like I go to the end of the</text><text start="4947.11" dur="3.51">label and a suddenly I got that there it</text><text start="4948.94" dur="3.42">is which means that you can&apos;t work with</text><text start="4950.62" dur="2.73">almost any manufacturers because that&apos;s</text><text start="4952.36" dur="2.76">what they need to make it work in their</text><text start="4953.35" dur="5.43">machine it&apos;s a magnesium stearate and</text><text start="4955.12" dur="5.25">and all this stuff right yeah so all all</text><text start="4958.78" dur="3.18">of that like doing the integrity thing</text><text start="4960.37" dur="4.2">is just a hard thing to make work</text><text start="4961.96" dur="4.29">fiscally but like you have found with</text><text start="4964.57" dur="3.06">your podcast if you do there will be</text><text start="4966.25" dur="2.67">people that are attracted to that thing</text><text start="4967.63" dur="3.42">and it can grow so that&apos;s what we&apos;re</text><text start="4968.92" dur="9.33">trying to do that&apos;s cool yeah the real</text><text start="4971.05" dur="9.72">deal so in terms of the other things</text><text start="4978.25" dur="4.92">that people typically use I want to just</text><text start="4980.77" dur="5.43">run run a couple of these by you because</text><text start="4983.17" dur="4.86">I take my qualia I guess about five days</text><text start="4986.2" dur="3.93">a week and as I said it&apos;s been strange</text><text start="4988.03" dur="4.02">that my dosage has gone down it must be</text><text start="4990.13" dur="3.99">fixing me that&apos;s the way I look at it</text><text start="4992.05" dur="3.75">like it&apos;s it&apos;s connecting synapses or</text><text start="4994.12" dur="3.24">something that were off and other</text><text start="4995.8" dur="3.12">they&apos;re getting more in alignment so</text><text start="4997.36" dur="4.62">what I look at it but there&apos;s other</text><text start="4998.92" dur="5.28">things to that depending on where I&apos;m</text><text start="5001.98" dur="4.05">going what I&apos;m doing I find to be useful</text><text start="5004.2" dur="3.27">so today for example I knew that I was</text><text start="5006.03" dur="3.12">gonna have a very social day I&apos;m going</text><text start="5007.47" dur="3.84">to be talking to you I&apos;m being interview</text><text start="5009.15" dur="3.75">the way back home after this so I did a</text><text start="5011.31" dur="4.8">number of different things one of them</text><text start="5012.9" dur="4.95">being phenibut for example which I&apos;ll</text><text start="5016.11" dur="3.69">maybe do once a week or something like</text><text start="5017.85" dur="5.849">that and I just find it&apos;s just a really</text><text start="5019.8" dur="7.169">great social lubricant and then I also</text><text start="5023.699" dur="8.04">took some piracetam because I find that</text><text start="5026.969" dur="7.291">it really helps me with speech so some</text><text start="5031.739" dur="5.46">of these other things I&apos;ll do but I</text><text start="5034.26" dur="5.729">could give Joe here piracetam and it&apos;ll</text><text start="5037.199" dur="4.801">give him anxiety or he won&apos;t notice</text><text start="5039.989" dur="4.71">anything or I give someone else I gave a</text><text start="5042.0" dur="4.02">girlfriend once phenibut and she</text><text start="5044.699" dur="4.081">probably took a little bit too much but</text><text start="5046.02" dur="4.59">she got deathly ill you know andand what</text><text start="5048.78" dur="3.93">I would take for this it&apos;s like a</text><text start="5050.61" dur="3.75">sprinkle to me to her she was a bit</text><text start="5052.71" dur="4.38">smaller and just had this huge adverse</text><text start="5054.36" dur="4.92">reaction same thing I modafinil is</text><text start="5057.09" dur="6.33">another one that I really like and for</text><text start="5059.28" dur="6.689">me I take an eighth a dose of modafinil</text><text start="5063.42" dur="4.59">for me is an eighth of one tablet right</text><text start="5065.969" dur="3.75">so it&apos;s like a 200 milligram tablet once</text><text start="5068.01" dur="2.91">I took a half I was like oh my god I</text><text start="5069.719" dur="4.141">feel like I&apos;m on crystal meth</text><text start="5070.92" dur="6.09">not fun a quarter if

doing full</text><text start="5820.93" dur="4.98">research on the actual products and say</text><text start="5823.78" dur="3.81">does this product have the</text><text start="5825.91" dur="3.72">specifications that the literature shows</text><text start="5827.59" dur="3.33">are useful and then curate those things</text><text start="5829.63" dur="4.47">so we&apos;re building a

dur="5.01">like you really can do a lot on your own</text><text start="5886.63" dur="4.35">and then if you&apos;re if you are tied into</text><text start="5888.88" dur="4.01">someone good and functional medicine and</text><text start="5890.98" dur="4.14">they&apos;re able to kind of you know be a</text><text start="5892.89" dur="3.82">step above you in terms of their body</text><text

footwork and</text><text start="5900.55" dur="3.87">order my own labs and geek out in like</text><text start="5902.38" dur="3.39">which labs are the best and most updated</text><text start="5904.42" dur="3.51">because even my functional medicine</text><text start="5905.77" dur="4.53">doctor they&apos;re still in the labs that</text><text start="5907.93" dur="3.99">were the best GI test last year

know my</text><text start="5921.22" dur="2.88">limitations in terms of my body of</text><text start="5923.14" dur="2.13">knowledge and what I may have been</text><text start="5924.1"

start="5929.86" dur="3.45">I know what I know and then I go to the</text><text start="5931.78" dur="3.53">experts that are higher of the food</text><text start="5933.31" dur="4.89">chain and in their area of special</text><text start="5935.31" dur="5.77">specialization right so it&apos;s really cool</text><text start="5938.2" dur="5.76">that that you guys are thinking that far</text><text

about</text><text start="5946.21" dur="7.38">is a integrative medical functional</text><text start="5951.43" dur="3.93">medical program so we&apos;ve got a number of</text><text start="5953.59" dur="3.48">doctors who are kind of the best</text><text start="5955.36" dur="1.92">integrative psychiatrists that I&apos;m aware</text><text start="5957.07" dur="2.94">of</text><text start="5957.28" dur="4.53">yeah well psychiatrists or just</text><text start="5960.01" dur="6.53">functional medicine that does second or</text><text start="5961.81" dur="7.95">pharmacology and so you know we&apos;re not</text><text start="5966.54" dur="5.05">allowed to provide medical information</text><text start="5969.76" dur="5.19">prescribe diagnose treat anything like</text><text start="5971.59" dur="5.67">that right so if people and if someone</text><text start="5974.95" dur="3.72">is on has psych conditions or on psych</text><text start="5977.26" dur="3.42">meds you don&apos;t use our stuff because</text><text start="5978.67" dur="3.99">there&apos;s there&apos;s real interactions that</text><text start="5980.68" dur="3.15">need to be factored but we don&apos;t want to</text><text start="5982.66" dur="2.34">just say go to your doctor if your</text><text start="5983.83" dur="3.06">doctor doesn&apos;t know anything we want to</text><text start="5985.0" dur="3.33">provide better resources so go to your</text><text start="5986.89" dur="2.55">doctor and here are doctors that</text><text start="5988.33" dur="4.19">actually know that field really well</text><text start="5989.44" dur="5.88">they can run a qejy on you they can run</text><text start="5992.52" dur="5.92">neural hormones they can run your Walsh</text><text start="5995.32" dur="4.35">metabolic labs they can run your gut</text><text start="5998.44" dur="3.12">brain access they can look at your</text><text start="5999.67" dur="5.73">genomics etc and actually do the the</text><text start="6001.56" dur="7.47">best of what functional brain chemistry</text><text start="6005.4" dur="5.13">optimization currently looks like and so</text><text start="6009.03" dur="2.79">that&apos;s something that we&apos;ll be rolling</text><text start="6010.53" dur="3.2">out in this next year and then we&apos;ve</text><text start="6011.82" dur="4.29">been already working with another that&apos;s</text><text start="6013.73" dur="4.45">amazing that&apos;s amazing</text><text start="6016.11" dur="4.89">yeah because you do need that that</text><text start="6018.18" dur="4.23">middleman you know you&apos;re just a freakin</text><text start="6021.0" dur="4.11">genius and you have the time and energy</text><text start="6022.41" dur="4.17">to devote to yourself but I think each</text><text start="6025.11" dur="3.69">one of us can only take it to a certain</text><text start="6026.58" dur="3.51">level and we need you know we need that</text><text start="6028.8" dur="2.97">help but it&apos;s like how do you find a</text><text start="6030.09" dur="3.18">good one I always get the question of</text><text start="6031.77" dur="4.11">who&apos;s the best functional medicine</text><text start="6033.27" dur="4.5">doctor and I&apos;m just I just made it easy</text><text start="6035.88" dur="4.23">on myself after working with a number of</text><text start="6037.77" dur="4.53">them individually and I just joined</text><text start="6040.11" dur="3.9">parsley health which is like a you know</text><text start="6042.3" dur="3.84">sort of I think of it as the uber of</text><text start="6044.01" dur="4.05">functional medicine just a a modern</text><text start="6046.14" dur="4.83">interface and a membership model rather</text><text start="6048.06" dur="4.38">than paying per visit and and I find it</text><text start="6050.97" dur="2.82">to be really effective because they can</text><text start="6052.44" dur="2.88">deal with my insurance in the billing</text><text start="6053.79" dur="2.97">and they know how to code the labs and</text><text start="6055.32" dur="3.3">stuff but it&apos;s still very much</text><text start="6056.76" dur="2.19">self-directed like I could just follow</text><text start="6058.62" dur="1.8">their</text><text start="6058.95" dur="4.56">program probably be healthy but I&apos;m</text><text start="6060.42" dur="5.31">always digging deeper so I&apos;ll do you</text><text start="6063.51" dur="3.78">know three different tests for metals</text><text start="6065.73" dur="3.69">where they might just order me the pre</text><text start="6067.29" dur="3.72">and post challenged your intestine like</text><text start="6069.42" dur="3.69">oh that gives me a certain metric but</text><text start="6071.01" dur="4.47">just hair analysis there&apos;s blood there&apos;s</text><text start="6073.11" dur="4.74">other ways you can dive into that but</text><text start="6075.48" dur="3.99">it&apos;s helpful to have someone you trust</text><text start="6077.85" dur="3.93">that&apos;ll go along with what you&apos;re doing</text><text start="6079.47" dur="5.1">he&apos;s back in the Western medicine model</text><text start="6081.78" dur="4.5">I go into the general practitioner and</text><text start="6084.57" dur="3.48">be like hey I have X Y &amp; Z wrong they</text><text start="6086.28" dur="3.9">send me out to a number of specialists</text><text start="6088.05" dur="3.45">that are their cronies and it&apos;s like you</text><text start="6090.18" dur="2.82">get stuck in that whole thing and I&apos;m</text><text start="6091.5" dur="3.0">going in there telling them about some</text><text start="6093.0" dur="3.51">new supplement or technology and the</text><text start="6094.5" dur="4.74">doctors like what I don&apos;t even know</text><text start="6096.51" dur="4.41">about that you know like I was having</text><text start="6099.24" dur="4.29">some problems with like vertigo and</text><text start="6100.92" dur="5.13">dizziness and I you know went up the the</text><text start="6103.53" dur="3.99">ladder in LA medical system which i</text><text start="6106.05" dur="2.79">think is probably a pretty good place to</text><text start="6107.52" dur="3.69">live if you want some you know</text><text start="6108.84" dur="4.83">high-level medical care and I got sent</text><text start="6111.21" dur="4.08">to did you know the world&apos;s best EMT</text><text start="6113.67" dur="3.45">that people travel from all over the</text><text start="6115.29" dur="3.06">world I go sit down with this guy said</text><text start="6117.12" dur="2.43">yeah man I don&apos;t know man I have you</text><text start="6118.35" dur="2.79">know I have a little hearing loss over</text><text start="6119.55" dur="2.97">here that&apos;s about 20% I&apos;m well aware of</text><text start="6121.14" dur="2.67">that but I have this thing where I&apos;m</text><text start="6122.52" dur="4.38">getting dizzy all the time and I always</text><text start="6123.81" dur="4.65">feel carsick and he ran some tests for</text><text start="6126.9" dur="3.54">me I came in again he goes yeah I think</text><text start="6128.46" dur="4.74">you probably should just not drink</text><text start="6130.44" dur="4.38">coffee I think it&apos;s the the caffeine can</text><text start="6133.2" dur="4.2">do that like really this is what you</text><text start="6134.82" dur="4.71">guys this the best you guys can do is</text><text start="6137.4" dur="3.87">that the caffeine is making me you know</text><text start="6139.53" dur="3.84">it was just like oh my god</text><text start="6141.27" dur="4.02">I could have done a much better job of</text><text start="6143.37" dur="3.87">being my own doctor and of course I you</text><text start="6145.29" dur="4.26">know finding finding the root of that</text><text start="6147.24" dur="3.69">but it&apos;s a cool time to be alive where</text><text start="6149.55" dur="3.09">those of us that are waking up and have</text><text start="6150.93" dur="4.52">access to information like you guys are</text><text start="6152.64" dur="6.24">providing can really take responsibility</text><text start="6155.45" dur="6.01">well no and not become this dependent</text><text start="6158.88" dur="6.42">infant on the teat of Western medicine</text><text start="6161.46" dur="4.86">and all the inherent expenses and things</text><text start="6165.3" dur="2.76">that come along with that</text><text start="6166.32" dur="5.28">and it&apos;s really important to keep the</text><text start="6168.06" dur="6.0">Pareto principle in mind which is it</text><text start="6171.6" dur="3.96">does get complex quickly and to be able</text><text start="6174.06" dur="3.96">to synthesize that complexity is a</text><text start="6175.56" dur="5.07">really deep topic and the foundations</text><text start="6178.02" dur="4.59">are still 80% of it and the foundations</text><text start="6180.63" dur="3.63">are not that hard right I mean they</text><text start="6182.61" dur="2.79">might be hard to do from a discipline</text><text start="6184.26" dur="5.4">point of view in the life that is</text><text start="6185.4" dur="6.33">conditioned otherwise but if someone is</text><text start="6189.66" dur="2.82">not sleeping enough sleeping well and</text><text start="6191.73" dur="2.94">sleeping enough</text><text start="6192.48" dur="4.02">everything else they&apos;ll do is just tiny</text><text start="6194.67" dur="5.61">diminishing returns in comparison and</text><text start="6196.5" dur="6.39">sleeping enough right right and if</text><text start="6200.28" dur="4.68">someone is not exercising and if they&apos;re</text><text start="6202.89" dur="3.69">not generally eating well and if they&apos;re</text><text start="6204.96" dur="6.84">not doing some kinds of stress</text><text start="6206.58" dur="8.01">management and mental processes then the</text><text start="6211.8" dur="5.97">you know biohacking is actually a way to</text><text start="6214.59" dur="4.89">support living shittily right trying to</text><text start="6217.77" dur="4.17">like symptom manage the fact that their</text><text start="6219.48" dur="6.06">life actually sucks right and that&apos;s</text><text start="6221.94" dur="4.95">just not the way to go right and so if</text><text start="6225.54" dur="3.33">someone really just does the</text><text start="6226.89" dur="4.77">foundational stuff it&apos;s amazing how much</text><text start="6228.87" dur="5.16">of it that addresses and even like I say</text><text start="6231.66" dur="4.559">we look at heavy metals so I can do a</text><text start="6234.03" dur="4.709">pre and post provocation test and I can</text><text start="6236.219" dur="3.661">test with the MPs or DMS a or EDTA and</text><text start="6238.739" dur="5.551">I&apos;m gonna get different specific</text><text start="6239.88" dur="6.21">findings and I can look at hair labs</text><text start="6244.29" dur="4.139">which will give me a different time</text><text start="6246.09" dur="5.37">scale of what&apos;s being excreted and I can</text><text start="6248.429" dur="6.031">look at you know metal antibody stands</text><text start="6251.46" dur="5.58">ND and then what I&apos;m gonna find is okay</text><text start="6254.46" dur="4.35">there are specific chelation or binders</text><text start="6257.04" dur="4.4">that I&apos;m going to use differentially if</text><text start="6258.81" dur="6.09">it&apos;s lead versus mercury right or</text><text start="6261.44" dur="5.56">gadolinium or whatever it is that&apos;s a</text><text start="6264.9" dur="4.86">lot to figure out it&apos;s a lot of expense</text><text start="6267.0" dur="4.86">and if I just put the person in a sauna</text><text start="6269.76" dur="4.29">every day and I gave them chlorella in</text><text start="6271.86" dur="6.54">the morning that would be 80% as good</text><text start="6274.05" dur="7.11">right yeah and so it&apos;s just kind of</text><text start="6278.4" dur="4.38">important like one of the things we want</text><text start="6281.16" dur="3.42">people to know is that there are</text><text start="6282.78" dur="4.98">foundational things that if they don&apos;t</text><text start="6284.58" dur="4.86">have the time money proclivity will</text><text start="6287.76" dur="5.04">really help them be radically healthier</text><text start="6289.44" dur="4.83">and and then optimization on top of that</text><text start="6292.8" dur="3.57">it&apos;s nice right</text><text start="6294.27" dur="3.87">right yeah that&apos;s that&apos;s well stated</text><text start="6296.37" dur="4.29">sometimes they&apos;ll find myself taking a</text><text start="6298.14" dur="4.829">50 pills in the morning trying to turn</text><text start="6300.66" dur="4.289">my brain on and then I realized maybe if</text><text start="6302.969" dur="5.581">I hadn&apos;t gone to bed at 2:00 a.m. and</text><text start="6304.949" dur="5.52">woken up at 7:30 you know so that&apos;s</text><text start="6308.55" dur="4.29">that&apos;s very true some of those things</text><text start="6310.469" dur="3.601">are just basic lifestyle choices if you</text><text start="6312.84" dur="4.109">eat if you think about it if you&apos;re</text><text start="6314.07" dur="6.18">gonna eat food in its measured in pounds</text><text start="6316.949" dur="5.101">and it&apos;s all nutrients right that&apos;s all</text><text start="6320.25" dur="3.12">stalks in our nutrient and then you&apos;re</text><text start="6322.05" dur="2.11">gonna take supplements that are measured</text><text start="6323.37" dur="3.17">in grey</text><text start="6324.16" dur="3.55">the supplement the word supplement means</text><text start="6326.54" dur="3.21">to supplement that what you&apos;re getting</text><text start="6327.71" dur="3.84">from right-right like getting the pounds</text><text start="6329.75" dur="4.86">right is a big [ __ ] deal right</text><text start="6331.55" dur="5.82">and similarly was sleep like when you</text><text start="6334.61" dur="4.14">exercise all that torn muscle that it</text><text start="6337.37" dur="3.27">needs repair is gonna be repairing</text><text start="6338.75" dur="3.15">during sleep during Delta&apos;s they can</text><text start="6340.64" dur="2.85">particular and all those nutrients that</text><text start="6341.9" dur="4.89">need to go into new tissues are gonna do</text><text start="6343.49" dur="4.71">that during sleep and so if you&apos;re not</text><text start="6346.79" dur="3.0">sleeping enough like all the other stuff</text><text start="6348.2" dur="3.87">just kind of doesn&apos;t matter that much</text><text start="6349.79" dur="4.05">and so this is one of the places where I</text><text start="6352.07" dur="4.32">want to empower people in the face of</text><text

that&apos;s what we want to do but I&apos;m</text><text start="7265.42" dur="7.11">excited about it cool awesome man okay</text><text start="7268.33" dur="6.75">so yeah I will say obviously we didn&apos;t</text><text start="7272.53" dur="6.42">get into psychedelics and entheogens no</text><text start="7275.08" dur="6.11">I have a whole section on that yeah and</text><text start="7278.95"

evolutionary</text><text start="7285.97" dur="4.68">environment I will make a thought and</text><text start="7287.8" dur="4.89">closing is just like a statin is</text><text start="7290.65" dur="3.81">optimizing for one thing right lower</text><text start="7292.69" dur="3.299">your cholesterol without looking at hey</text><text start="7294.46" dur="3.15">is the cholesterol maybe

start="7299.47" dur="5.34">whole rest of the story going on when we</text><text start="7302.26" dur="3.69">optimize for something that is affecting</text><text start="7304.81" dur="3.179">a lot of other things we&apos;re not paying</text><text start="7305.95" dur="5.91">attention we get externality rate which</text><text start="7307.989" dur="6.961">is also a cold side effect we built the</text><text start="7311.86" dur="4.89">entire world the human built world for a</text><text start="7314.95" dur="3.24">few purposes and ways that affected a</text><text start="7316.75" dur="4.89">lot of other things so we build a house</text><text start="7318.19" dur="6.299">to protect us from the elements and give</text><text start="7321.64" dur="4.8">us a you know a safe place to be and</text><text start="7324.489" dur="3.511">then maybe for a certain aspects of</text><text start="7326.44" dur="4.11">aesthetics but we didn&apos;t pay attention</text><text start="7328.0" dur="4.5">to oh well there&apos;s actually chemistry</text><text start="7330.55" dur="4.2">that&apos;s in the paint that is affecting us</text><text start="7332.5" dur="5.22">and oh you have the fungicides that are</text><text start="7334.75" dur="5.22">in there that are making fungicide</text><text start="7337.72" dur="3.42">resistant funguses that are why we have</text><text start="7339.97" dur="2.82">an issue with mold we never did before</text><text start="7341.14" dur="4.89">oh that that actually it&apos;s important</text><text start="7342.79" dur="4.8">thing like in the drywall paints out in</text><text start="7346.03" dur="4.38">the paint in the 70s started having</text><text start="7347.59" dur="6.24">fungicides added resist mold and then</text><text start="7350.41" dur="5.67">the mold became super MRSA mold oh god</text><text start="7353.83" dur="4.21">that&apos;s so the reason everyone has mold</text><text start="7356.08" dur="3.16">issues when we lived with mold forever</text><text start="7358.04" dur="5.55">we&apos;re in an environment that&apos;s because</text><text start="7359.24" dur="8.07">this is me anymore oh my god so but even</text><text start="7363.59" dur="5.46">Suns like you know the color and angle</text><text start="7367.31" dur="3.27">right all of these end up affecting the</text><text start="7369.05" dur="3.96">the psyche this field of environmental</text><text start="7370.58" dur="3.69">cycling right if you&apos;re in an if you&apos;re</text><text start="7373.01" dur="5.13">in an area where there&apos;s graffiti and</text><text start="7374.27" dur="5.43">trash on the ground and the walls this</text><text start="7378.14" dur="3.63">kind of environmental psych studies been</text><text start="7379.7" dur="3.48">done many times if if you just paint</text><text start="7381.77" dur="3.18">over the graffiti and clean up the trash</text><text start="7383.18" dur="2.4">violent crime drops like thirty to fifty</text><text start="7384.95" dur="2.73">percent</text><text start="7385.58" dur="4.38">Wow and it&apos;s because you think about</text><text start="7387.68" dur="5.55">what the environments

start="7395.87" dur="3.54">a place where law doesn&apos;t operate</text><text start="7397.01" dur="4.65">mmm-hmm right cuz yeah a bit broken and</text><text start="7399.41" dur="3.39">they&apos;re not right rectified right and</text><text start="7401.66" dur="3.66">right as soon as you fix those things</text><text start="7402.8" dur="4.47">how violent human beings are is being</text><text start="7405.32" dur="4.44">changed at the like fifty percent level</text><text start="7407.27" dur="5.73">by an environmental psych right I&apos;ve</text><text start="7409.76" dur="5.46">heard David Hawkins talk about that he</text><text start="7413.0" dur="4.23">called it the broken window theory you</text><text start="7415.22" dur="3.87">know you have the building in the ghetto</text><text start="7417.23" dur="3.33">and it gets ignored and then someone</text><text start="7419.09" dur="2.82">breaks the window and then someone comes</text><text start="7420.56" dur="2.82">along breaks another window then comes</text><text start="7421.91" dur="2.79">the graffiti then the drug dealers on</text><text start="7423.38" dur="3.66">the corner and Everett I never thought</text><text start="7424.7" dur="4.65">about the kind of mechanics of it that&apos;s</text><text start="7427.04" dur="3.8">very interesting it&apos;s I guess the it&apos;s</text><text start="7429.35" dur="3.72">like the level of consciousness of</text><text start="7430.84" dur="5.8">anything could you say would you frame</text><text start="7433.07" dur="5.67">it in that way I would say that&apos;s a way</text><text start="7436.64" dur="6.09">of reducing the complexity of it right</text><text start="7438.74" dur="5.88">um which is kind of my thing I interview</text><text start="7442.73" dur="4.77">people like you and go to squish that</text><text start="7444.62" dur="4.74">down into a bite-sized thought but I</text><text start="7447.5" dur="5.94">mean so if you go into a cathedral</text><text start="7449.36" dur="8.19">they&apos;re doing environmental psych and so</text><text start="7453.44" dur="6.45">the sound and the smell and the visual</text><text start="7457.55" dur="4.65">and every aspect of the sensory process</text><text start="7459.89" dur="4.59">is designed to uplift and exulting but</text><text start="7462.2" dur="4.83">then specifically that it&apos;s narrow and</text><text start="7464.48" dur="4.71">very high has a certain effect that&apos;s</text><text start="7467.03" dur="4.41">different than if it was wide and high</text><text start="7469.19" dur="4.44">or if it was not high right which is</text><text start="7471.44" dur="5.04">you&apos;re very focused on up</text><text start="7473.63" dur="5.01">and so then you feel very small and you</text><text start="7476.48" dur="3.81">can both have a sense of feeling you</text><text start="7478.64" dur="3.69">know and then the priest is halfway</text><text start="7480.29" dur="2.91">between you and where Jesus is up there</text><text start="7482.33" dur="3.3">right and where God is</text><text start="7483.2" dur="4.2">and so both if you want to look at the</text><text start="7485.63" dur="3.65">cynical side of the this is how you make</text><text start="7487.4" dur="3.86">a good authority rien</text><text start="7489.28" dur="3.45">dynamic where everybody feels small an</text><text start="7491.26" dur="3.18">authority up there but also the</text><text start="7492.73" dur="3.36">beautiful the mystical side of people</text><text start="7494.44" dur="4.29">feeling a sense of all an exaltation</text><text start="7496.09" dur="4.14">right the environmental psychology of</text><text start="7498.73" dur="3.329">how those buildings are done induced</text><text start="7500.23" dur="3.54">state right just like Burning Man</text><text start="7502.059" dur="5.611">induces state because of the environment</text><text start="7503.77" dur="5.76">even if you don&apos;t period so what we are</text><text start="7507.67" dur="4.08">realizing is that we have built a world</text><text start="7509.53" dur="3.839">that we are not well adapted to all</text><text start="7511.75" dur="2.789">right and it&apos;s affecting us in a lot of</text><text start="7513.369" dur="4.131">ways that we didn&apos;t pay attention to</text><text
