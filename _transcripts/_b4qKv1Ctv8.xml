never a lot of broadcast my goal was</text><text start="936.15" dur="3.42">to communicate with people that I also</text><text start="938.07" dur="3.66">thought were earnestly endeavoring

things together well I</text><text start="947.99" dur="7.39">suppose that the way I view it is that</text><text start="952.32" dur="7.05">there are very few people at the moment</text><text

there are so few people who</text><text start="999.51" dur="7.44">are interested in what I would think are</text><text start="1001.99" dur="9.97">the existential questions for humans do</text><text start="1006.95" dur="7.5">you find first of all that you think</text><text start="1011.96" dur="4.74">that that our our world in our society</text><text start="1014.45" dur="8.1">is thinking properly about where it is</text><text start="1016.7" dur="8.1">and at this point in human history ah no</text><text start="1022.55" dur="6.029">I obviously don&apos;t think that we&apos;re</text><text

epistemic</text><text start="1048.83" dur="4.38">inadequacy coming from whatever domain</text><text start="1051.14" dur="3.33">specialty looking at something that&apos;s so</text><text start="1053.21" dur="2.79">much more complex than any domain</text><text start="1054.47" dur="6.92">specialty by itself is going to do a</text><text start="1056.0" dur="8.82">good job of I think you speak well to</text><text start="1061.39" dur="6.82">why there are not more different ideas</text><text start="1064.82" dur="7.14">trying to figure things out is you end</text><text start="1068.21" dur="6.329">up getting some kind of dominant system</text><text start="1071.96" dur="4.62">that is this autopoietic it&apos;s</text><text start="1074.539" dur="4.201">self-perpetuating and so then it&apos;s you</text><text start="1076.58" dur="5.069">want to say what what you mean by</text><text start="1078.74" dur="6.299">autopoietic yes self-perpetuating self</text><text start="1081.649" dur="5.431">authoring and so let&apos;s and when we say</text><text start="1085.039" dur="3.63">system it&apos;s like what system we talk</text><text start="1087.08" dur="3.78">about the academic system are we talking</text><text start="1088.669" dur="3.931">about the monetary system are we talking</text><text start="1090.86" dur="3.029">about our government system are we</text><text start="1092.6" dur="2.28">talking about culture are we talking</text><text start="1093.889" dur="3.211">about media and information</text><text start="1094.88" dur="6.06">communication and it&apos;s yes it&apos;s the</text><text start="1097.1" dur="7.74">intersection of all those into a kind of</text><text start="1100.94" dur="6.0">civilizational system and that I think</text><text start="1104.84" dur="4.62">can be best thought of if we want to</text><text start="1106.94" dur="5.93">think of it in simple terms as the</text><text start="1109.46" dur="6.27">system that confers power to things and</text><text start="1112.87" dur="4.689">so of course everything that supports</text><text start="1115.73" dur="3.36">that system gets more power within the</text><text start="1117.559" dur="5.431">system and everything that would</text><text start="1119.09" dur="6.51">possibly threaten the core relevancy or</text><text start="1122.99" dur="3.929">validity of the system threatens people</text><text start="1125.6" dur="3.63">who are doing well in the system and so</text><text start="1126.919" dur="5.581">it gets kind of spit out by the system</text><text start="1129.23" dur="7.62">and so I think that&apos;s a very strong</text><text start="1132.5" dur="7.289">normative force all right so let me let</text><text start="1136.85" dur="4.65">me give a little bit of my frame we can</text><text start="1139.789" dur="3.841">try to pass things back and forth and</text><text start="1141.5" dur="4.409">feel free to take over if you like but</text><text start="1143.63" dur="4.019">here&apos;s what I see that I think of is</text><text start="1145.909" dur="4.471">being really interesting and rather</text><text start="1147.649" dur="6.15">mysterious I see a decision tree in</text><text start="1150.38" dur="5.81">which I think at a society-wide level I</text><text start="1153.799" dur="5.73">can&apos;t accept any of the major branches</text><text

start="1281.39" dur="5.73">I&apos;m fairly dubious of not because we</text><text start="1284.51" dur="3.99">couldn&apos;t with near-term tech get some</text><text start="1287.12" dur="2.79">people

dur="4.12">on earth</text><text start="1297.36" dur="3.72">at least the trajectory as I see it so</text><text start="1299.91" dur="7.05">then the question you asked is there</text><text start="1301.08" dur="7.86">some other thing like progress to a</text><text start="1306.96" dur="3.6">totally different type of social system</text><text start="1308.94" dur="4.53">here or totally

that all converge if we</text><text start="1493.11" dur="6.63">look at the kind of Club of Rome limits</text><text start="1495.509" dur="7.561">of growth type model I think that this</text><text

dur="4.969">understanding your terminology positive</text><text start="1530.19" dur="6.3">some dynamics means that whatever the</text><text start="1533.179" dur="7.87">mythical PI of it keeps getting

dur="3.63">all be captured by a few right like not</text><text start="1544.83" dur="3.24">actually have anything like appropriate</text><text start="1546.509" dur="3.27">to distribution and we know that wealth</text><text start="1548.07" dur="3.329">has a power-law distribution and there&apos;s</text><text start="1549.779" dur="2.73">some very fundamental things about why</text><text

dur="4.71">people who have almost everything and</text><text start="1572.22" dur="4.89">most people have quite little and that</text><text start="1575.34" dur="3.36">as you know if we look at like the</text><text start="1577.11" dur="3.809">increase in wealth that has happened</text><text start="1578.7" dur="3.959">since the internet it has not been</text><text start="1580.919"

there a name for</text><text start="1588.45" dur="4.26">the pie that&apos;s growing but we&apos;re almost</text><text start="1590.279" dur="5.851">everybody slice except for a few</text><text start="1592.71" dur="5.55">people&apos;s is shrinking well I mean we</text><text start="1596.13" dur="5.429">could call it global GDP is one very</text><text start="1598.26" dur="5.34">simplified metric and we can say okay so</text><text start="1601.559" dur="4.171">we want global GDP to increase because</text><text start="1603.6" dur="5.579">that represents total goods and services</text><text start="1605.73" dur="5.04">that represent some way of thinking</text><text start="1609.179" dur="3.151">about value it&apos;s a really bad way of</text><text start="1610.77" dur="10.379">thinking about value and I think we</text><text start="1612.33" dur="12.12">should discuss that okay if obviously up</text><text start="1621.149" dur="4.561">until the Industrial Revolution they</text><text start="1624.45" dur="4.8">were about a half a billion people on</text><text start="1625.71" dur="5.849">the planet at most okay and then we go</text><text start="1629.25" dur="8.279">as soon as the Industrial ushion and our</text><text start="1631.559" dur="7.651">ability to extract resources at faster</text><text start="1637.529" dur="4.321">than their reproduction amounts from the</text><text start="1639.21" dur="4.949">biosphere we go from half a billion</text><text start="1641.85" dur="5.15">people over whatever three hundred</text><text start="1644.159" dur="5.281">thousand years of Homo Sapien history to</text><text start="1647.0" dur="5.26">eight billion people in almost no time</text><text start="1649.44" dur="7.41">at all and so that&apos;s like there&apos;s a real</text><text start="1652.26" dur="6.389">issue there that is we are subsidizing</text><text start="1656.85" dur="3.84">our growth with savings accounts that</text><text start="1658.649" dur="3.121">are finite and this a bunch of different</text><text start="1660.69" dur="3.63">ways of thinking about that but if we</text><text start="1661.77" dur="4.56">look at biodiversity loss or species</text><text start="1664.32" dur="4.05">extinction or growing dead zones in the</text><text start="1666.33" dur="5.63">ocean or any of these issues not just</text><text start="1668.37" dur="7.2">climate change we can see that we have</text><text start="1671.96" dur="6.64">we have a linear materials economy that</text><text start="1675.57" dur="5.719">takes resources from the earth unruhe</text><text start="1678.6" dur="5.73">new ibly and produces a bunch of</text><text start="1681.289" dur="4.481">pollution waste heat whatever in the</text><text start="1684.33" dur="3.12">process of manufacturing transportation</text><text start="1685.77" dur="5.1">and then turns them into trash on this</text><text start="1687.45" dur="5.579">side and so we get both accumulation</text><text start="1690.87" dur="4.02">dynamics and depletion dynamics and you</text><text start="1693.029" dur="4.951">can&apos;t keep running accumulation and</text><text start="1694.89" dur="7.53">lesion dynamics on a finite biosphere</text><text start="1697.98" dur="7.2">indefinitely okay now of course you see</text><text start="1702.42" dur="5.12">the the immediate next argument which is</text><text start="1705.18" dur="5.07">make a closed-loop economy well that you</text><text start="1707.54" dur="4.66">you needed to burn fossil fuels for a</text><text start="1710.25" dur="3.72">period of time in order to become</text><text start="1712.2" dur="3.66">wealthy enough to figure out how to do</text><text start="1713.97" dur="3.96">something clean green and sustainable</text><text start="1715.86" dur="4.59">right and so the idea is that these are</text><text start="1717.93" dur="4.89">really just intermediate phases and it</text><text start="1720.45" dur="6.09">looks pretty dirty and grubby now but in</text><text start="1722.82" dur="5.79">fact good news human human ingenuity is</text><text start="1726.54" dur="3.42">boundless and so we&apos;ll just think our</text><text start="1728.61" dur="5.37">way out of whatever new problems we&apos;ve</text><text start="1729.96" dur="5.85">created so we can all easily say we</text><text start="1733.98" dur="5.16">can&apos;t keep running a linear materials</text><text start="1735.81" dur="4.92">economy with exponential growth on the</text><text start="1739.14" dur="4.44">planet that&apos;s pretty straightforward and</text><text start="1740.73" dur="4.59">that we&apos;re actually very near limits of</text><text start="1743.58" dur="6.03">our capacity to keep doing that on a</text><text start="1745.32" dur="5.34">bunch of different atomic cycles so then</text><text start="1749.61" dur="2.73">we say okay well we have to go</text><text start="1750.66" dur="3.06">closed-loop where the new stuff that we</text><text start="1752.34" dur="2.82">make comes from the old stuff that old</text><text start="1753.72" dur="2.76">stuff turns into new stuff and that</text><text start="1755.16" dur="4.83">we&apos;re able to do that closed loop</text><text start="1756.48" dur="6.9">cycling of matter using renewable energy</text><text start="1759.99" dur="5.01">and so this is one necessary dynamic but</text><text start="1763.38" dur="2.97">this already doesn&apos;t look like the model</text><text start="1765.0" dur="3.27">that you&apos;re mentioning of society</text><text start="1766.35" dur="3.39">hobbling along mostly the same because</text><text start="1768.27" dur="3.42">that&apos;s actually really really different</text><text start="1769.74" dur="4.02">that would already be a significant</text><text start="1771.69" dur="4.2">change not maybe a significant as a warp</text><text start="1773.76" dur="4.05">drive but it would be a fundamentally</text><text start="1775.89" dur="6.18">different type of civilization okay</text><text start="1777.81" dur="5.91">and so I would say that that movement to</text><text start="1782.07" dur="3.03">a closed loop materials economy is</text><text start="1783.72" dur="9.48">necessary but no we&apos;re close to</text><text start="1785.1" dur="11.25">sufficient one one thing that&apos;s going to</text><text start="1793.2" dur="5.37">come is if I want to run anything like</text><text start="1796.35" dur="5.88">capitalism just from a materials economy</text><text start="1798.57" dur="5.49">basis where I&apos;m going to have to keep</text><text start="1802.23" dur="3.36">growing the capital supply year over</text><text start="1804.06" dur="3.51">year just to keep up with interest right</text><text start="1805.59" dur="5.25">you there&apos;s an exponential expansion of</text><text start="1807.57" dur="5.67">the monetary basis that is required for</text><text start="1810.84" dur="5.31">capitalism to exist so then to not</text><text start="1813.24" dur="5.55">debase the currency we have to keep</text><text start="1816.15" dur="4.29">growing the goods and services and I</text><text start="1818.79" dur="3.3">can&apos;t actually in a closed-loop</text><text start="1820.44" dur="3.69">materials economy that is near the</text><text start="1822.09" dur="5.04">carrying capacity I can&apos;t keep growing</text><text start="1824.13" dur="4.35">the goods and services indefinitely so</text><text start="1827.13" dur="5.15">then of course the argument is well</text><text start="1828.48" dur="6.24">we can do it almost all digitally and</text><text start="1832.28" dur="3.639">this a bit of a complex argument but I</text><text start="1834.72" dur="3.78">would say there are some coupling</text><text start="1835.919" dur="4.5">coefficients between how much virtual</text><text start="1838.5" dur="3.69">value we have that keeps being valued</text><text start="1840.419" dur="4.14">that doesn&apos;t go into diminishing returns</text><text start="1842.19" dur="3.69">relative to how much physical value that</text><text start="1844.559" dur="3.99">there&apos;s some coupling coefficients</text><text start="1845.88" dur="4.08">between atoms energy and bits that make</text><text start="1848.549" dur="8.401">up the materials economy and then also</text><text start="1849.96" dur="9.06">time human attention so I don&apos;t think</text><text start="1856.95" dur="3.99">that we can keep running a exponential</text><text start="1859.02" dur="6.77">capital expansion but I&apos;ll make a</text><text start="1860.94" dur="7.14">simpler argument capitalism and</text><text start="1865.79" dur="4.9">nationalism but feudalism is also an</text><text

dur="3.181">may have caused the last 50 years I</text><text start="2039.289" dur="2.971">think that people who had direct</text><text start="2040.58" dur="4.74">experience of the depression in

was the first time that we actually</text><text start="2068.21" dur="5.58">had existential level technology as the</text><text start="2070.909" dur="4.081">species in our recorded history that&apos;s a</text><text start="2073.79" dur="2.67">big deal because we couldn&apos;t have</text><text start="2074.99" dur="4.71">actually blown ourselves up before then</text><text start="2076.46" dur="4.919">and in evolutionary time or even</text><text start="2079.7" dur="3.389">civilization time that&apos;s just like a few</text><text start="2081.379" dur="5.76">minutes right like this not very long</text><text start="2083.089" dur="5.82">that we&apos;ve had that I agree and if you</text><text start="2087.139" dur="4.381">read like if you read Ellsberg&apos;s</text><text start="2088.909" dur="3.96">doomsday machine it is kind of lucky</text><text start="2091.52" dur="2.76">that we haven&apos;t blown ourselves up</text><text start="2092.869" dur="2.671">because there were a lot of just</text><text start="2094.28" dur="5.61">mistakes it should have blown</text><text start="2095.54" dur="7.5">right but it&apos;s really hard to build</text><text start="2099.89" dur="5.04">nukes right it really takes nation state</text><text start="2103.04" dur="4.2">level capacity and mostly only a few</text><text start="2104.93" dur="4.32">nation states so could do it yeah and</text><text start="2107.24" dur="4.28">this is the point is that if you only</text><text start="2109.25" dur="4.44">have a few actors that have nukes</text><text start="2111.52" dur="3.7">everybody can monitor each other and</text><text start="2113.69" dur="5.25">have something like mutually assured</text><text start="2115.22" dur="5.76">destruction to force an equilibrium but</text><text start="2118.94" dur="3.48">this is the thing about exponential tech</text><text start="2120.98" dur="4.19">is we don&apos;t just get exponentially more</text><text start="2122.42" dur="5.55">powerful tech we get exponentially more</text><text start="2125.17" dur="4.3">distribution on powerful tech Daniel I</text><text start="2127.97" dur="3.18">want to keep going with this but I&apos;m</text><text start="2129.47" dur="3.39">gonna keep slowing you down when you use</text><text start="2131.15" dur="4.89">a term that may not be familiar to a</text><text start="2132.86" dur="6.03">sufficient number of our listeners what</text><text start="2136.04" dur="7.17">do you mean by X is exponential tech so</text><text start="2138.89" dur="6.69">tech that helps us make better tech so</text><text start="2143.21" dur="5.31">we get a return curve on the technology</text><text start="2145.58" dur="5.28">so we see this kind of exponential the</text><text start="2148.52" dur="4.32">very famously Moore&apos;s law in computing</text><text start="2150.86" dur="5.04">we see this kind of exponential rate of</text><text start="2152.84" dur="5.19">growth of computing power because like</text><text start="2155.9" dur="3.57">nuclear bombs don&apos;t actually give us</text><text start="2158.03" dur="3.3">better insight into how to make nuclear</text><text start="2159.47" dur="3.12">bombs directly but computers give us</text><text start="2161.33" dur="5.04">better insight into how to make better</text><text start="2162.59" dur="5.52">computers and so there are different</text><text start="2166.37" dur="4.29">areas of exponential tech where the</text><text start="2168.11" dur="4.23">technology itself increases our capacity</text><text start="2170.66" dur="3.18">to make more of the technology or some</text><text start="2172.34" dur="3.96">underlying dynamic where we get some</text><text start="2173.84" dur="4.89">exponential increases in our capacity so</text><text start="2176.3" dur="5.33">we can see for varying reasons</text><text start="2178.73" dur="5.46">exponential increases in compute power</text><text start="2181.63" dur="4.72">exponential increases in certain types</text><text start="2184.19" dur="4.92">of biotech like specifically things</text><text start="2186.35" dur="6.53">associated with like CRISPR genetic</text><text start="2189.11" dur="7.35">engineering gene drives nanotech and</text><text start="2192.88" dur="5.14">those things all you get Exponential&apos;s</text><text start="2196.46" dur="3.9">also because they&apos;re we&apos;re dealing with</text><text start="2198.02" dur="5.34">things that could self replicate right</text><text start="2200.36" dur="5.04">and so a nuclear bomb is a big deal but</text><text start="2203.36" dur="3.93">it doesn&apos;t self replicate but a</text><text start="2205.4" dur="3.54">synthetic biology device can self</text><text start="2207.29" dur="3.57">replicate or a genetically engineered</text><text start="2208.94" dur="6.59">thing can and so we can have exponential</text><text start="2210.86" dur="4.67">growth of the effect of something and so</text><text start="2216.49" dur="6.51">if we if we take a look at the growth in</text><text start="2223.21" dur="3.64">biotechnology capacity and we</text><text start="2225.23" dur="3.44">specifically look at breakthroughs like</text><text start="2226.85" dur="3.92">CRISPR tech</text><text start="2228.67" dur="5.97">and the capacity for things like gene</text><text start="2230.77" dur="7.89">drives to be able to modify foundational</text><text start="2234.64" dur="6.3">biology well that makes it to where by a</text><text start="2238.66" dur="4.59">warfare capacity like very high level by</text><text start="2240.94" dur="3.45">a warfare capacity becomes much much</text><text start="2243.25" dur="3.059">much simpler so things that</text><text start="2244.39" dur="4.199">nation-states used to be able to do non</text><text start="2246.309" dur="4.77">nation-states are gaining the capacity</text><text start="2248.589" dur="5.46">to be able to do even drone tech like we</text><text start="2251.079" dur="4.801">had the the first everybody&apos;s who&apos;s</text><text start="2254.049" dur="3.3">thought about it has been like when are</text><text start="2255.88" dur="3.33">we going to have a really big problem</text><text start="2257.349" dur="3.48">with drones and a couple years ago was</text><text start="2259.21" dur="3.3">the first time in the Ukraine where a</text><text start="2260.829" dur="4.171">commercial drone with a homemade</text><text start="2262.51" dur="4.349">thermite bomb dropped it on a munitions</text><text start="2265.0" dur="3.27">factory and because they had a munitions</text><text start="2266.859" dur="3.781">factory and detonated the whole thing</text><text start="2268.27" dur="4.319">you get a billion dollars of damage from</text><text start="2270.64" dur="3.63">just they can be one person doing a very</text><text start="2272.589" dur="3.841">simple thing in their garage with out</text><text start="2274.27" dur="6.39">any kind of really traceable exotic</text><text start="2276.43" dur="7.61">materials but we can do we can we can do</text><text start="2280.66" dur="5.13">much worse things than that with</text><text start="2284.04" dur="3.519">exponentially increasing technological</text><text start="2285.79" dur="4.11">power so the main thing when I say</text><text start="2287.559" dur="4.381">exponential tech is just we are getting</text><text start="2289.9" dur="5.79">an exponential increase in how powerful</text><text start="2291.94" dur="5.28">the choices we make can be and that&apos;s a</text><text start="2295.69" dur="4.139">good way to think about technology as a</text><text start="2297.22" dur="3.629">lever on our choice making right so no</text><text start="2299.829" dur="3.091">technology at all</text><text start="2300.849" dur="4.141">I can make different choices if I want</text><text start="2302.92" dur="3.78">to be violent I can hit somebody stone</text><text start="2304.99" dur="4.349">tool allows me to extend my hitting</text><text start="2306.7" dur="4.53">capacity and hit much harder right a gun</text><text start="2309.339" dur="3.901">takes that much further and an</text><text start="2311.23" dur="3.72">intercontinental ballistic missile takes</text><text start="2313.24" dur="5.579">that much further which it&apos;s a similar</text><text start="2314.95" dur="5.609">type of choice to make which is solve</text><text start="2318.819" dur="4.471">this problem through violence extended</text><text start="2320.559" dur="4.891">by a much much bigger lever and what I</text><text start="2323.29" dur="4.14">would say is if you look at the kind of</text><text start="2325.45" dur="5.31">people we have ever been like look at</text><text start="2327.43" dur="4.56">the Romans look at the Sumerians look at</text><text start="2330.76" dur="2.94">the mines look at any kind of people</text><text start="2331.99" dur="4.17">we&apos;ve been and look at the distribution</text><text start="2333.7" dur="4.26">of ways we&apos;ve made choices take any of</text><text start="2336.16" dur="2.49">those people and give them exponentially</text><text start="2337.96" dur="2.099">more power</text><text start="2338.65" dur="5.159">factoring how they&apos;ve used their power</text><text start="2340.059" dur="5.79">and they self-terminate like they don&apos;t</text><text start="2343.809" dur="3.361">use they&apos;re not good stewards of power</text><text start="2345.849" dur="3.331">and well I agree that we&apos;re not good</text><text start="2347.17" dur="5.429">stewards of power I think that there is</text><text start="2349.18" dur="5.28">a mystery here that if we

we</text><text start="2376.81" dur="7.53">don&apos;t know it&apos;s a mysterious situation</text><text start="2381.18" dur="5.26">there are plenty of reservoirs to poison</text><text start="2384.34"

that we</text><text start="2390.94" dur="4.8">experienced I&apos;m always astounded that</text><text start="2393.7" dur="4.95">the numbers are as low as they are and</text><text start="2395.74" dur="6.81">you could make an argument that said</text><text start="2398.65" dur="7.38">that in general people who are not in a</text><text start="2402.55" dur="6.69">position to benefit or engaged in

the</text><text start="3325.93" dur="3.42">mosquitoes off and then we recognize how</text><text start="3327.58" dur="3.51">lethal the DDT is so then we sell it to</text><text start="3329.35"

some new</text><text start="3335.58" dur="5.08">chemical that we say is less toxic just</text><text start="3339.37" dur="5.76">because the long term Studies on its</text><text start="3340.66"

dur="7.32">there&apos;s this idea of a multipolar trap</text><text start="3379.84" dur="5.88">which is some scenario where some agent</text><text start="3384.46" dur="4.35">in the system whether the

dur="3.21">everybody else that now everybody else</text><text start="3404.74" dur="3.51">has to race to do that thing and you get</text><text start="3406.36" dur="4.62">a race to the cliff so an arms

actually</text><text start="3534.849" dur="6.091">point us to some game theoretic thing</text><text start="3538.119" dur="4.62">that all all of our friends who did the</text><text start="3540.94"

with exponentially more</text><text start="3569.57" dur="4.53">power the race to the bottoms are much</text><text start="3571.58" dur="4.5">deeper bottoms so in the past we&apos;ve had</text><text start="3574.1" dur="5.1">boom and bust cycles associated with</text><text start="3576.08" dur="5.16">those right right and so everybody</text><text start="3579.2" dur="5.61">starts doing the pollution

dur="2.58">clean the pollution up at a certain</text><text start="3587.69" dur="2.94">point because people are willing to pay</text><text start="3589.1" dur="2.94">for that and so you&apos;ll get these kind of</text><text start="3590.63" dur="3.33">boom and bust cycles that&apos;s kind of the</text><text start="3592.04" dur="6.72">best that a market can give you with</text><text

this many people</text><text start="3602.87" dur="4.98">basically is unviable and so we&apos;ve never</text><text start="3606.2" dur="3.06">figured out how to solve for that class</text><text start="3607.85" dur="3.36">and I&apos;m saying that that&apos;s one of the</text><text start="3609.26" dur="4.26">things you&apos;re asking is there a game B</text><text start="3611.21" dur="3.69">that I believe in it would have to solve</text><text start="3613.52" dur="4.43">for a number of things it would have to</text><text start="3614.9" dur="6.03">actually remove rival risk

this has been always been my</text><text start="3647.45" dur="5.91">problem with game B is that I look at</text><text start="3650.36" dur="6.06">the I look at the game theory and I look</text><text

just</text><text start="3952.91" dur="4.67">I guess what I find very bizarre about</text><text start="3954.92" dur="5.46">all of this is that I live in multiple</text><text start="3957.58" dur="5.32">social worlds and intellectual worlds</text><text start="3960.38" dur="6.48">and in some of my worlds this stuff</text><text start="3962.9" dur="5.91">strikes people as loopy oh here comes</text><text start="3966.86" dur="5.31">the stuff about the AGI that the robots</text><text start="3968.81" dur="4.89">are gonna kill us all and in some other</text><text start="3972.17" dur="4.07">portion of my world it&apos;s like well</text><text start="3973.7" dur="5.01">clearly we&apos;re on the verge of AGI and</text><text start="3976.24" dur="6.58">that&apos;s going to be the existential risk</text><text start="3978.71" dur="5.67">and this is in part to go back to your</text><text start="3982.82" dur="4.83">original point and something that you</text><text start="3984.38" dur="6.42">and I share a failure a catastrophic</text><text start="3987.65" dur="5.76">failure of communal sense making right</text><text start="3990.8" dur="5.13">so what I&apos;ve claimed is is that the</text><text start="3993.41" dur="5.82">revolution that we&apos;re in is is based</text><text start="3995.93" dur="5.52">around the idea that we don&apos;t have what</text><text start="3999.23" dur="5.94">I&apos;ve called semi reliable communal sense</text><text start="4001.45" dur="5.97">making we can&apos;t all agree now even if</text><text start="4005.17" dur="4.68">it&apos;s slightly wrong or maybe even deeply</text><text start="4007.42" dur="4.44">wrong as to what it is that we&apos;re seeing</text><text start="4009.85" dur="5.52">where we are in human history what our</text><text start="4011.86" dur="5.7">issues are and so the first part of this</text><text start="4015.37" dur="5.22">decision tree that goes really wrong is</text><text start="4017.56" dur="7.35">that a lot of people think that we&apos;re in</text><text start="4020.59" dur="5.16">great shape okay so this is I I&apos;m</text><text start="4024.91" dur="2.37">actually gonna come back to the</text><text start="4025.75" dur="3.68">paperclip Maximizer because it explains</text><text start="4027.28" dur="4.65">why we don&apos;t have communal sense making</text><text start="4029.43" dur="4.6">if instead of thinking about an</text><text start="4031.93" dur="4.47">artificial intelligence they can</text><text start="4034.03" dur="4.14">increase its capacity while optimizing</text><text start="4036.4" dur="3.48">something we think of a collective</text><text start="4038.17" dur="3.45">intelligence that can some way that</text><text start="4039.88" dur="4.56">humans are processing information</text><text start="4041.62" dur="4.44">together in a group a market is a kind</text><text start="4044.44" dur="3.51">of collective intelligence right the</text><text start="4046.06" dur="3.69">whole idea of what the invisible hand of</text><text start="4047.95" dur="4.26">the market that the market will figure</text><text start="4049.75" dur="4.32">out what stuff people really want it&apos;s</text><text start="4052.21" dur="4.17">expressed as demand and then which</text><text start="4054.07" dur="5.42">version of the various supplies is best</text><text start="4056.38" dur="5.55">that I would say it&apos;s an intelligence</text><text start="4059.49" dur="3.64">it&apos;s not a central intelligence but the</text><text start="4061.93" dur="4.52">idea is that there is kind of an</text><text start="4063.13" dur="8.85">emergent intelligent is an emergent</text><text start="4066.45" dur="7.3">property of this thing and you know it</text><text start="4071.98" dur="3.33">computes things like prices and</text><text start="4073.75" dur="4.23">allocations and if that&apos;s what you mean</text><text start="4075.31" dur="6.48">by intelligence that I oh yeah so it&apos;s</text><text start="4077.98" dur="8.13">it is a bottom-up coordination system</text><text start="4081.79" dur="4.88">that does end up having new

market as a as</text><text start="4092.88" dur="4.29">kind of at the sender I can take</text><text start="4094.29" dur="5.67">capitalism at the center of the more</text><text start="4097.17" dur="4.5">general class of what I would call rival</text><text start="4099.96" dur="4.41">risk dynamics as a whole as a kind of</text><text start="4101.67" dur="4.47">collective intelligence because the</text><text start="4104.37" dur="3.54">thing that wins at the game of rivalry</text><text start="4106.14" dur="3.84">gets selected for and so there is this</text><text start="4107.91" dur="5.07">kind of learning of how to get better at</text><text start="4109.98" dur="5.55">rival risk games learning across the</text><text start="4112.98" dur="4.32">system as a whole which which things win</text><text start="4115.53" dur="4.65">in or which things keep more people</text><text start="4117.3" dur="4.59">believing the thing which keep people</text><text start="4120.18" dur="8.19">from at ridding out of the thing like</text><text start="4121.89" dur="8.73">that that makes sense yes and so I would</text><text start="4128.37" dur="7.77">say that we have if we just take the</text><text start="4130.62" dur="7.47">capitalism part capitalism is a paper</text><text start="4136.14" dur="4.32">clip Maximizer that is converting the</text><text start="4138.09" dur="4.47">natural world and human resources into</text><text start="4140.46" dur="5.25">capital while getting better at doing so</text><text start="4142.56" dur="5.16">so it goes from barter to currency to</text><text start="4145.71" dur="4.86">fiat currency to fractional reserve</text><text start="4147.72" dur="4.98">process to complex financial instruments</text><text start="4150.57" dur="4.83">to high-speed trading on those those are</text><text start="4152.7" dur="5.42">like the increase in its capacity to do</text><text start="4155.4" dur="5.16">that but specifically now it is a</text><text start="4158.12" dur="3.25">incentive for all the humans to do</text><text start="4160.56" dur="3.27">certain things</text><text start="4161.37" dur="4.95">so if leaving the whale alive in the</text><text start="4163.83" dur="4.62">ocean confers no economic advantage on</text><text start="4166.32" dur="3.24">me but killing it and selling it as meat</text><text start="4168.45" dur="3.99">is a million dollars of economic</text><text start="4169.56" dur="4.23">advantage and if I don&apos;t kill it the a</text><text start="4172.44" dur="2.73">whale still won&apos;t be alive because</text><text start="4173.79" dur="3.27">somebody else is gonna kill it anyways</text><text start="4175.17" dur="3.81">and then that they might actually even</text><text start="4177.06" dur="4.5">use that economic power against me now</text><text start="4178.98" dur="4.2">I&apos;ve got I have an incentive system that</text><text start="4181.56" dur="3.78">is encouraging all the humans to behave</text><text start="4183.18" dur="3.54">in certain kinds of ways and now not</text><text start="4185.34" dur="2.94">only do we need to kill the whales we</text><text start="4186.72" dur="4.26">need to race at getting better to do it</text><text start="4188.28" dur="5.04">and making better militaries and</text><text start="4190.98" dur="5.19">extracting all the resources and so I</text><text start="4193.32" dur="4.92">see this as a kind of so if I&apos;m</text><text start="4196.17" dur="3.78">understanding where you&apos;re headed what</text><text start="4198.24" dur="7.94">you&apos;re saying is is that the market is</text><text start="4199.95" dur="11.39">kind of a precursor to an AGI it is a</text><text start="4206.18" dur="5.16">collective intelligence that is</text><text start="4212.36" dur="4.9">eventually self terminating in the same</text><text start="4215.19" dur="3.9">way that a cancer is right the cancer</text><text start="4217.26" dur="2.37">cells are self-replicating and they&apos;re</text><text start="4219.09" dur="2.31">growing</text><text start="4219.63" dur="3.72">to the normal cells but they end up</text><text start="4221.4" dur="6.54">killing the host which kills themselves</text><text start="4223.35" dur="6.48">and so the the reason I&apos;m bringing this</text><text start="4227.94" dur="5.43">up in terms of collective sense making</text><text start="4229.83" dur="5.28">is those who do the will of capitalism</text><text start="4233.37" dur="4.349">like those who do the will of the</text><text start="4235.11" dur="4.29">paperclip Maximizer Moloch&apos;s or on</text><text start="4237.719" dur="4.561">whatever kind of analogy we want to use</text><text start="4239.4" dur="5.46">here those who do well at the game of</text><text start="4242.28" dur="4.41">power get more power and then they use</text><text start="4244.86" dur="5.1">that legislative power media power</text><text start="4246.69" dur="4.92">capital power to make systems that to</text><text start="4249.96" dur="4.59">modify the systems in ways that help</text><text start="4251.61" dur="5.19">them more right those who oppose the</text><text start="4254.55" dur="3.93">system of power also oppose those who</text><text start="4256.8" dur="3.839">are doing well at it so even though the</text><text start="4258.48" dur="4.08">system is inanimate the people who are</text><text start="4260.639" dur="3.871">doing well at it or animate so then they</text><text start="4262.56" dur="4.349">take those people out which is we see</text><text start="4264.51" dur="4.649">how Martin Luther King and Gandhi and</text><text start="4266.909" dur="6.121">Jesus and etc died people who actually</text><text start="4269.159" dur="6.531">opposed the system of power right and so</text><text start="4273.03" dur="6.6">you end up having a system that is</text><text start="4275.69" dur="6.75">selecting for or is conferring more</text><text start="4279.63" dur="5.19">power to those who are good at getting</text><text start="4282.44" dur="5.02">more power which ends up meaning who are</text><text start="4284.82" dur="8.85">selecting for conferring power to</text><text start="4287.46" dur="9.42">sociopathy yeah I I don&apos;t find this part</text><text start="4293.67" dur="6.299">of the argument well maybe I&apos;m just</text><text start="4296.88" dur="5.7">stuck somewhere doing okay let me be I</text><text start="4299.969" dur="4.051">mean I think I&apos;m on your side so I want</text><text start="4302.58" dur="4.29">to help make a different part of this</text><text start="4304.02" dur="5.46">case I think a lot of this comes down to</text><text start="4306.87" dur="7.41">magical thinking because of the non use</text><text start="4309.48" dur="9.69">of nuclear weapons against humans since</text><text start="4314.28" dur="7.29">1945 I think that one thing if 9/11 had</text><text start="4319.17" dur="5.58">been a nuclear attack rather than a</text><text start="4321.57" dur="5.97">weird conventional attack we would know</text><text start="4324.75" dur="6.659">where we were in human history and by</text><text start="4327.54" dur="6.06">virtue of our luck and our luck alone we</text><text start="4331.409" dur="4.29">are completely confused as to how</text><text start="4333.6" dur="4.71">perilous the present moment is because</text><text start="4335.699" dur="6.811">our luck has been amazing and if you</text><text start="4338.31" dur="6.659">believe surprising yeah if you believe</text><text start="4342.51" dur="6.209">that somehow it can&apos;t be luck because</text><text start="4344.969" dur="5.73">it&apos;s this good then you believe that</text><text start="4348.719" dur="3.75">there&apos;s some unknown principle keeping</text><text start="4350.699" dur="2.79">us safe and that you don&apos;t know what the</text><text start="4352.469" dur="3.871">name of that principle</text><text start="4353.489" dur="5.34">maybe it&apos;s human engine in ingenuity</text><text start="4356.34" dur="6.629">maybe it&apos;s some sort of secret</text><text start="4358.829" dur="5.761">collective that keeps the world sensible</text><text start="4362.969" dur="3.511">maybe it&apos;s that markets have tied us all</text><text start="4364.59" dur="3.929">together I don&apos;t know what your story is</text><text start="4366.48" dur="5.239">yeah but whatever your story is it&apos;s</text><text start="4368.519" dur="6.421">wrong and it&apos;s it&apos;s obviously wrong</text><text start="4371.719" dur="5.141">right the the idea that we didn&apos;t have</text><text start="4374.94" dur="6.469">anything like 9/11 and then we had a</text><text start="4376.86" dur="8.37">sudden 9/11 kind of attack is itself</text><text start="4381.409" dur="7.5">paradigm attic that these things with</text><text start="4385.23" dur="7.32">which you have no data familiarity I</text><text start="4388.909" dur="6.991">mean look there was no suicide bombing</text><text start="4392.55" dur="7.919">in the modern world before the 1980s and</text><text start="4395.9" dur="7.089">I think this is the point is that it&apos;s</text><text start="4400.469" dur="4.291">generally more advantageous within a</text><text start="4402.989" dur="3.09">market to believe that markets are good</text><text start="4404.76" dur="1.68">in the world as healthy and things are</text><text start="4406.079" dur="3.06">awesome</text><text start="4406.44" dur="4.619">I&apos;ll usually do better in academia if I</text><text start="4409.139" dur="3.511">say academia is good right which is a</text><text start="4411.059" dur="3.18">point that you make if I really</text><text start="4412.65" dur="3.119">criticize it heavily I&apos;m gonna get less</text><text start="4414.239" dur="5.101">tense this is Peter&apos;s point more than my</text><text start="4415.769" dur="5.52">point okay yeah I will usually do better</text><text start="4419.34" dur="3.509">in markets if I say they&apos;re awesome and</text><text start="4421.289" dur="3.031">do better in a corporation if I say it&apos;s</text><text start="4422.849" dur="5.821">awesome and so there is kind of an</text><text start="4424.32" dur="6.179">incentive for optimism about the</text><text start="4428.67" dur="3.06">dominant system if I want to do well in</text><text start="4430.499" dur="2.941">the dominant system and if I have</text><text start="4431.73" dur="3.059">critiques of the dominant system I&apos;m</text><text start="4433.44" dur="3.119">usually going to do less well in it</text><text start="4434.789" dur="3.511">which means less power will get</text><text start="4436.559" dur="4.381">conferred to those ideas and so there&apos;s</text><text start="4438.3" dur="5.819">kind of a mimetic selection right like</text><text start="4440.94" dur="5.219">the memes that that do well end up being</text><text start="4444.119" dur="3.75">the memes that propagate but do well</text><text start="4446.159" dur="5.101">with an ax current system well look this</text><text start="4447.869" dur="5.431">is why I&apos;ve called for a return to</text><text start="4451.26" dur="5.58">above-ground nuclear testing because my</text><text start="4453.3" dur="5.189">belief is is that we you laugh but I&apos;m</text><text start="4456.84" dur="4.83">not kidding yeah I mean if we don&apos;t get</text><text start="4458.489" dur="5.73">our amygdalas really engaged with where</text><text start="4461.67" dur="4.409">we are this magical thinking which by</text><text start="4464.219" dur="3.21">the way I suffer from this magical thing</text><text start="4466.079" dur="3.571">I&apos;m not it&apos;s not something I&apos;m claiming</text><text start="4467.429" dur="5.67">everyone else has I have the idea that</text><text start="4469.65" dur="5.069">nothing too bad can can come that you</text><text start="4473.099" dur="3.33">know I always asked this weird question</text><text start="4474.719" dur="4.351">which is how many foreign nuclear</text><text start="4476.429" dur="4.5">devices are currently on US soil people</text><text start="4479.07" dur="3.569">always think about the nukes will have</text><text start="4480.929" dur="2.911">to come through an ICBM I&apos;m not at all</text><text start="4482.639" dur="3.661">convinced that that would have to be</text><text start="4483.84" dur="3.549">true people just don&apos;t think about these</text><text start="4486.3" dur="3.75">things because</text><text start="4487.389" dur="5.911">we&apos;ve been in such a rare period of time</text><text start="4490.05" dur="5.1">that these things haven&apos;t like everybody</text><text start="4493.3" dur="4.74">who&apos;s talked in these terms</text><text start="4495.15" dur="4.39">sort of to me like there&apos;s a part of me</text><text start="4498.04" dur="3.51">that sounds like okay well that&apos;s the</text><text start="4499.54" dur="6.71">kind of a conversation you have on on a</text><text start="4501.55" dur="7.109">dorm floor during a bull session like</text><text start="4506.25" dur="5.32">grown-ups realize that something is</text><text start="4508.659" dur="4.08">keeping the world together which is</text><text start="4511.57" dur="4.379">funny right because it&apos;s basically</text><text start="4512.739" dur="7.771">saying grown-ups have bought into</text><text start="4515.949" dur="6.301">magical thinking exactly yeah and so by</text><text start="4520.51" dur="4.229">the way a lot of the people that I think</text><text start="4522.25" dur="4.38">of as being the smartest most</text><text start="4524.739" dur="4.351">interesting people have not bought into</text><text start="4526.63" dur="4.859">this magical thinking what has happened</text><text start="4529.09" dur="6.029">is is that those people have been pushed</text><text start="4531.489" dur="5.521">out of the institutions that form this</text><text start="4535.119" dur="3.781">sort of weird conversation that I refer</text><text start="4537.01" dur="5.7">to as the gated institutional narrative</text><text start="4538.9" dur="6.33">and the depopulation of dissenters like</text><text start="4542.71" dur="7.44">really serious dissenters from inside</text><text start="4545.23" dur="7.11">the institutional complex is one of the</text><text start="4550.15" dur="3.48">defining features of our age to me but</text><text start="4552.34" dur="4.649">something that you can&apos;t get any</text><text start="4553.63" dur="5.609">commentary on because the commentary</text><text start="4556.989" dur="5.19">you&apos;re really looking for is is that</text><text start="4559.239" dur="5.46">conversation so what I just try to do is</text><text start="4562.179" dur="4.201">to show people that no matter what you</text><text start="4564.699" dur="5.181">do the gated institutional narrative</text><text start="4566.38" dur="6.18">cannot look at certain very basic facts</text><text start="4569.88" dur="5.83">right so you get a very dangerous kind</text><text start="4572.56" dur="5.19">of groupthink there and even if someone</text><text

dur="6.39">wherever where you had an actual pretty</text><text start="4645.58" dur="5.19">developed nation that didn&apos;t also expect</text><text start="4649.63" dur="4.02">that it was going to go through war and</text><text start="4650.77" dur="4.8">collapse and then it did I bet that if</text><text start="4653.65" dur="4.08">we talk to those people they would have</text><text start="4655.57" dur="3.69">a very different intuition for the state</text><text start="4657.73" dur="3.99">of the fragility here because they</text><text start="4659.26" dur="4.35">actually have first-person experience</text><text start="4661.72" dur="2.85">it&apos;s something that seemed really stable</text><text start="4663.61" dur="3.39">and like it wasn&apos;t going to collapse</text><text start="4664.57" dur="4.8">actually did and most of us haven&apos;t</text><text start="4667.0" dur="4.59">actually been through anything like a</text><text start="4669.37" dur="3.78">collapse in our

start="4677.05" dur="4.95">where our intuition by itself like our</text><text start="4680.02" dur="4.32">intuition is informed by our experience</text><text start="4682.0" dur="5.46">but our experience is very short right</text><text start="4684.34" dur="4.62">and if we study past civilizations one</text><text start="4687.46" dur="3.33">of the things we know and you know we</text><text start="4688.96" dur="5.28">can read Tainter in the collapse of</text><text start="4690.79" dur="5.85">complex societies or you know other kind</text><text start="4694.24" dur="4.17">of good insights on how civilizational</text><text start="4696.64" dur="4.71">collapse works but none of the previous</text><text start="4698.41" dur="4.62">civilizations are still here like that&apos;s</text><text start="4701.35" dur="3.36">that&apos;s one of the important things to</text><text start="4703.03" dur="3.78">get is that they go through a life cycle</text><text start="4704.71" dur="4.98">and that they mostly collapse for</text><text start="4706.81" dur="4.44">self-induced reasons and that even if</text><text start="4709.69" dur="4.26">someone else overtook them oftentimes</text><text start="4711.25" dur="4.53">the group that overtook them was smaller</text><text start="4713.95" dur="3.78">than rivals that they had fended off</text><text start="4715.78" dur="3.6">previously because they had already</text><text start="4717.73" dur="3.6">started going through institutional</text><text start="4719.38" dur="4.29">collapse or civilizational collapse and</text><text start="4721.33" dur="4.14">if we look across all of them there are</text><text start="4723.67" dur="3.63">some things we can generalize about what</text><text start="4725.47" dur="3.96">leads to civilizational collapse but I</text><text start="4727.3" dur="3.39">think the difference now versus any of</text><text start="4729.43" dur="4.02">those other times is that due to</text><text start="4730.69" dur="4.2">globalization yeah in some ways the US</text><text start="4733.45" dur="3.12">and China are different civilizations</text><text start="4734.89" dur="5.31">but both of them would fail without each</text><text start="4736.57" dur="5.31">other currently and like we don&apos;t make</text><text start="4740.2" dur="3.3">our own computational substrate we don&apos;t</text><text start="4741.88" dur="3.12">make our own lots of things right like</text><text start="4743.5" dur="4.08">they don&apos;t do their own fundamental well</text><text start="4745.0" dur="6.03">but the size of the hope of the but the</text><text start="4747.58" dur="7.17">architects of many of these systems</text><text start="4751.03" dur="6.6">believed that a kind of eakin</text><text start="4754.75" dur="7.17">Sonic mutually assured destruction yeah</text><text start="4757.63" dur="6.81">it was the best way of producing hang</text><text start="4761.92" dur="4.38">that&apos;s been true you well so I was gonna</text><text start="4764.44" dur="3.0">bring up the case of Europe so one of</text><text start="4766.3" dur="5.19">the arguments for the European</text><text start="4767.44" dur="5.91">experiment is that you Europe is</text><text start="4771.49" dur="5.28">actually arguably the world&apos;s most</text><text start="4773.35" dur="5.48">dangerous region people are very</text><text start="4776.77" dur="8.34">competent and their long-standing</text><text start="4778.83" dur="9.07">rivalries and hatreds and you had some</text><text start="4785.11" dur="5.22">desire to create something that seems</text><text start="4787.9" dur="5.1">impossible which is a United States of</text><text start="4790.33" dur="4.35">Europe and nobody was gonna sign up for</text><text start="4793.0" dur="5.04">that so how do you do that while you</text><text start="4794.68" dur="5.7">back you back them into a financial</text><text start="4798.04" dur="4.17">union without political Union you give</text><text start="4800.38" dur="4.32">them their ability the ability to issue</text><text start="4802.21" dur="6.24">their own debt but not an ability to</text><text start="4804.7" dur="8.34">print it their currencies and then you</text><text start="4808.45" dur="7.26">wait for the collapse to come and then</text><text start="4813.04" dur="6.09">your hope in this storyline anyway you</text><text start="4815.71" dur="5.37">create a Federation which becomes a</text><text start="4819.13" dur="5.25">political Federation the United States</text><text start="4821.08" dur="5.19">of Europe is created because of a</text><text start="4824.38" dur="4.65">sovereign debt crisis and we sort of</text><text start="4826.27" dur="5.67">went through that which I believe was it</text><text start="4829.03" dur="5.19">was was sort of a sought after outcome</text><text start="4831.94" dur="6.02">which is maybe hopefully people will</text><text start="4834.22" dur="5.58">print their own their own debt and</text><text start="4837.96" dur="3.61">they&apos;ll issue debt and they won&apos;t be</text><text start="4839.8" dur="3.96">able to print their own currencies in</text><text start="4841.57" dur="5.1">order to inflate their way out of it</text><text start="4843.76" dur="7.29">ergo something positive will have to</text><text start="4846.67" dur="7.07">happen that seems to me to be also a</text><text start="4851.05" dur="6.09">recipe for disaster and that the</text><text start="4853.74" dur="5.65">architects of these plans seemingly died</text><text start="4857.14" dur="4.53">and everybody&apos;s on autopilot not</text><text start="4859.39" dur="4.32">understanding you know I&apos;ve seen this in</text><text start="4861.67" dur="5.19">the in terms of certain US policies</text><text start="4863.71" dur="5.58">where people create a policy for reasons</text><text start="4866.86" dur="4.08">that nobody&apos;s really understanding and a</text><text start="4869.29" dur="3.93">short time later nobody even knows why</text><text start="4870.94" dur="4.2">the policy was created the real reason</text><text start="4873.22" dur="3.93">and to begin with do you see that this</text><text start="4875.14" dur="4.98">kind of a world I think that&apos;s actually</text><text start="4877.15" dur="4.68">one of the meaningful dynamics in</text><text start="4880.12" dur="4.14">institutional decay and in</text><text start="4881.83" dur="4.5">civilizational decay is that a new</text><text start="4884.26" dur="4.32">civilization is formed coming out</text><text start="4886.33" dur="4.29">coming out of a war or after a migration</text><text start="4888.58" dur="8.01">or through a famine or after like some</text><text start="4890.62" dur="7.71">really developing yeah and to really be</text><text start="4896.59" dur="3.77">able to build something new took real</text><text start="4898.33" dur="4.38">capacities what you would call the</text><text start="4900.36" dur="4.93">contact with the unforgiving right like</text><text start="4902.71" dur="6.21">real empirical capacities and just</text><text start="4905.29" dur="4.71">loaded my lingo sir a bit yeah and I</text><text start="4908.92" dur="5.22">think that&apos;s really good</text><text start="4910.0" dur="6.99">lingo because like the I can&apos;t I can&apos;t</text><text start="4914.14" dur="5.76">lie to physics and have it reward me for</text><text start="4916.99" dur="4.56">it right like either I can grow corn or</text><text start="4919.9" dur="3.36">I can&apos;t grow corn either I can win it a</text><text start="4921.55" dur="4.38">war or I can&apos;t but there&apos;s a real</text><text start="4923.26" dur="4.86">situation and so oftentimes when we go</text><text start="4925.93" dur="5.27">from non more time where the generals</text><text start="4928.12" dur="5.22">are politicians to war time where the</text><text start="4931.2" dur="3.85">politician generals who maybe suck at</text><text start="4933.34" dur="2.97">war start losing battles and we cycle</text><text start="4935.05" dur="2.43">through looking for ones who are good at</text><text start="4936.31" dur="4.47">it then we get some who are actually</text><text start="4937.48" dur="6.72">good at war those difficult situations</text><text start="4940.78" dur="4.8">select for real empirical capacity but</text><text start="4944.2" dur="2.94">when you don&apos;t have those difficult</text><text start="4945.58" dur="3.27">situations then you&apos;re actually</text><text start="4947.14" dur="3.06">selecting for who can do politics best</text><text start="4948.85" dur="2.97">which means convince everyone of</text><text start="4950.2" dur="3.27">something whether it&apos;s true or not well</text><text start="4951.82" dur="5.28">this is what I call sharp Minds versus</text><text start="4953.47" dur="5.45">sharp elbows yeah and so you have the</text><text start="4957.1" dur="3.96">people who are at the beginning of</text><text start="4958.92" dur="5.4">figuring out how to do some new</text><text start="4961.06" dur="5.76">civilization and those people had some</text><text start="4964.32" dur="4.03">capacity to be in direct contact with</text><text start="4966.82" dur="4.77">reality and figure stuff out and then</text><text start="4968.35" dur="5.28">oftentimes what they pass on is the</text><text start="4971.59" dur="4.35">stuff they figured out but not the</text><text start="4973.63" dur="4.05">psychology in them and the capacities to</text><text start="4975.94" dur="3.45">figure stuff out so the generator</text><text start="4977.68" dur="4.26">function of the civilizational models</text><text start="4979.39" dur="4.86">lost and so now we start getting copying</text><text start="4981.94" dur="5.7">errors and people are hopefully trying</text><text start="4984.25" dur="5.16">to at least copy it earnestly so now</text><text start="4987.64" dur="3.93">we&apos;ve got a constitution or a set of law</text><text start="4989.41" dur="4.32">or a set of market practices or whatever</text><text start="4991.57" dur="5.28">it is but we don&apos;t really understand how</text><text start="4993.73" dur="4.77">we generated that effective thing and so</text><text start="4996.85" dur="3.81">that also means that as the environment</text><text start="4998.5" dur="4.5">changes we won&apos;t be able to adapt it</text><text start="5000.66" dur="3.75">adequately and that also means that</text><text start="5003.0" dur="3.24">we&apos;re not going to know how to deal with</text><text start="5004.41" dur="4.83">failures of it so then some people</text><text start="5006.24" dur="6.06">recognizing that start realizing that</text><text start="5009.24" dur="6.11">they can do better by defecting on the</text><text start="5012.3" dur="6.63">system and kind of preying on it then by</text><text start="5015.35" dur="4.69">participating with the system and so and</text><text start="5018.93" dur="2.61">this is what we</text><text start="5020.04" dur="5.7">think of as corruption right where they</text><text start="5021.54" dur="5.64">can start maximizing their own bonus</text><text start="5025.74" dur="3.0">structure or do it back in the or</text><text start="5027.18" dur="3.24">whatever and so long as it&apos;s adequately</text><text start="5028.74" dur="3.84">hidden they can get away with it and now</text><text start="5030.42" dur="3.63">that collapses the civilization even</text><text start="5032.58" dur="4.23">further so it goes from loss of</text><text start="5034.05" dur="5.01">generator function to copying errors to</text><text start="5036.81" dur="6.57">incentive for internal defection and</text><text start="5039.06" dur="6.66">disinformation and you know like I think</text><text start="5043.38" dur="4.08">that every civilization has faced this a</text><text start="5045.72" dur="3.12">loss of intergenerational knowledge</text><text start="5047.46" dur="2.73">transfer because it&apos;s not just the</text><text start="5048.84" dur="2.79">knowledge it&apos;s the generative function</text><text start="5050.19" dur="5.73">of how Lahti good it&apos;s also the case</text><text start="5051.63" dur="9.45">that real knowledge I think has become</text><text start="5055.92" dur="12.0">too dangerous to transmit and the real</text><text start="5061.08" dur="11.07">knowledge doesn&apos;t know what the social</text><text start="5067.92" dur="7.89">norms are and you know certainly the</text><text start="5072.15" dur="5.4">biological world is so disturbing I mean</text><text start="5075.81" dur="3.63">there&apos;s no corner of the biological</text><text start="5077.55" dur="3.87">world since you can look at where and</text><text start="5079.44" dur="5.82">not come away thinking wow that&apos;s</text><text start="5081.42" dur="5.52">incredibly destroyed and what we&apos;re</text><text start="5085.26" dur="3.57">seeing right now a situation in which we</text><text start="5086.94" dur="4.53">can&apos;t cope with any discussion of</text><text start="5088.83" dur="6.0">biology every single attempt to have a</text><text

dur="4.98">earliest place where I can see here&apos;s a</text><text start="5106.86" dur="4.41">subject of science that actually can&apos;t</text><text start="5109.83" dur="2.82">be discussed I

and so</text><text start="5250.739" dur="6.631">that was like a mental illness and but</text><text start="5254.63" dur="4.51">so they their definition of something</text><text start="5257.37" dur="4.29">that translated to schizophrenia the</text><text start="5259.14" dur="4.89">first symptom was had negative feelings</text><text start="5261.66" dur="4.559">about the state and the second symptoms</text><text start="5264.03" dur="3.87">might take a while to show up and so</text><text start="5266.219" dur="3.331">what I think happens is that the</text><text start="5267.9" dur="3.75">dominant system ends up eating</text><text start="5269.55" dur="3.6">psychology and saying that the</text><text start="5271.65" dur="3.36">psychology that supports the dominant</text><text start="5273.15" dur="3.3">system is healthy psychology and</text><text start="5275.01" dur="4.38">anything that is dissenting - it&apos;s not</text><text start="5276.45" dur="5.97">healthy it ends up beating spirituality</text><text start="5279.39" dur="5.64">and virtue and ethics and academia and</text><text start="5282.42" dur="4.44">whatever to basically say the the</text><text start="5285.03" dur="3.81">behaviors that support the system</text><text start="5286.86" dur="3.839">are good so the thinking that supports</text><text start="5288.84" dur="4.56">those behaviors is good and anything</text><text start="5290.699" dur="5.341">that&apos;s dissenting is bad and like it&apos;s</text><text start="5293.4" dur="4.77">so easy to see it in the Crusades or in</text><text

dur="5.97">by saying I think this is important and</text><text start="5439.409" dur="5.281">I think that you doing this as a portal</text><text start="5442.26" dur="6.689">to a better world where you

okay so what is the</text><text start="5467.52" dur="6.449">incentive for someone to agree with us</text><text start="5470.239" dur="5.831">that for the most part expressing these</text><text

no bottom</text><text start="5563.26" dur="4.89">at the moment okay so this is this is</text><text start="5565.93" dur="6.12">important about obviously stupidly wrong</text><text start="5568.15" dur="7.38">I understand obviously stupidly wrong</text><text start="5572.05" dur="6.06">when your ability to demonstrate your</text><text start="5575.53" dur="5.939">power is to go out in the public square</text><text start="5578.11" dur="5.16">and say the dumbest most ridiculous most</text><text start="5581.469" dur="6.511">obviously incorrect thing you can think</text><text start="5583.27" dur="6.929">of and nobody says a word yeah well one</text><text start="5587.98" dur="5.55">of the things I find interesting is you</text><text start="5590.199" dur="5.401">know if we ask a question like even</text><text start="5593.53" dur="5.72">what&apos;s actually causing coral die-off</text><text start="5595.6" dur="6.03">how much of it is temperature versus pH</text><text start="5599.25" dur="3.85">versus nitrogen messing up the</text><text start="5601.63" dur="3.569">phosphorous cycle versus trophic</text><text start="5603.1" dur="4.5">cascades right how long do we have</text><text start="5605.199" dur="4.831">before the coral die-off what are the</text><text start="5607.6" dur="5.22">consequences of that you know like</text><text start="5610.03" dur="4.53">really important questions right or what</text><text start="5612.82" dur="3.84">are the actual what really happened in</text><text start="5614.56" dur="4.139">North Korea like why there was such a</text><text start="5616.66" dur="3.87">change just recently and what are the</text><text start="5618.699" dur="4.951">actual tactical nuclear capabilities</text><text start="5620.53" dur="4.59">that they have or or how much leakage</text><text start="5623.65" dur="2.88">actually occurred at Fukushima or like</text><text start="5625.12" dur="3.93">any of these things nobody [ __ ] knows</text><text start="5626.53" dur="5.63">and you&apos;ll hear different narratives and</text><text start="5629.05" dur="5.46">you&apos;ll hear kind of equally compelling</text><text start="5632.16" dur="5.829">disagreeable narratives on those yeah</text><text start="5634.51" dur="6.15">and almost no one has the time or the</text><text start="5637.989" dur="4.861">will or the epistemic capacity to really</text><text start="5640.66" dur="3.96">figure that out so one point is the</text><text start="5642.85" dur="3.78">sense making is actually hard you have a</text><text start="5644.62" dur="6.51">situation in which a lot of these things</text><text start="5646.63" dur="7.98">are complex enough and there&apos;s so much</text><text start="5651.13" dur="5.28">disinformation that when people try to</text><text start="5654.61" dur="4.5">actually figure it out they just get a</text><text start="5656.41" dur="6.15">they get a information overwhelm and</text><text start="5659.11" dur="4.98">then it&apos;s very hard for them to continue</text><text start="5662.56" dur="3.09">so when you&apos;re saying like obviously</text><text start="5664.09" dur="4.5">stupid well there aren&apos;t there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="5665.65" dur="5.73">of places where people can hold a train</text><text start="5668.59" dur="4.71">of thought that seems cogent enough even</text><text start="5671.38" dur="4.5">if it&apos;s in direct opposition with</text><text start="5673.3" dur="4.77">another cogent train of thought and like</text><text start="5675.88" dur="3.81">just the plausible deniability that it</text><text start="5678.07" dur="3.84">might be one of the true ones since</text><text start="5679.69" dur="5.22">nobody can really sense make seems to be</text><text start="5681.91" dur="5.729">enough and so this is one of the really</text><text start="5684.91" dur="5.76">tricky things is in a world where</text><text start="5687.639" dur="5.1">if I have the incentive to dis inform ya</text><text start="5690.67" dur="4.35">at various different levels right and</text><text start="5692.739" dur="4.38">then I have exponential information tech</text><text start="5695.02" dur="3.96">so I can do exponential disinformation</text><text start="5697.119" dur="3.531">now this is when I say that the system</text><text start="5698.98"

like I think I think a lot</text><text start="5731.26" dur="7.08">of people know that news stations as</text><text start="5736.11" dur="5.14">for-profit companies have to make money</text><text start="5738.34" dur="6.51">right and they make money by monetizing</text><text start="5741.25" dur="6.389">attention and basically they they sell</text><text start="5744.85" dur="4.68">advertising and the advertisers pay more</text><text start="5747.639" dur="4.531">the more people who are watching for</text><text start="5749.53" dur="5.25">more total minutes so the incentive of</text><text start="5752.17" dur="5.34">the news station is to make stuff that</text><text start="5754.78" dur="4.709">is both inflaming and scary and</text><text start="5757.51" dur="3.419">entertaining and whatever it will engage</text><text start="5759.489" dur="4.891">people to spend a lot of time watching</text><text start="5760.929" dur="5.131">in and to not say things it would not be</text><text start="5764.38" dur="3.33">to the advantage of the advertisers that</text><text start="5766.06" dur="4.23">can afford to pay for them right so they</text><text start="5767.71" dur="5.34">have like they have an incentive to not</text><text start="5770.29" dur="4.679">share really complex nuanced things that</text><text start="5773.05" dur="4.379">will have most people click off but to</text><text start="5774.969" dur="5.491">share things if I see I don&apos;t I really</text><text start="5777.429" dur="4.411">don&apos;t let me give you an argument one of</text><text start="5780.46" dur="3.36">the things that I say that I think</text><text start="5781.84" dur="3.839">people find interesting is is that I</text><text start="5783.82" dur="4.04">believe the National

dur="5.58">I&apos;ve talked to the actual people who are</text><text start="5810.13" dur="7.02">involved with this it is amazingly</text><text start="5814.06" dur="6.21">interesting you could sell

I</text><text start="5841.75" dur="4.14">think profit is one part of it that&apos;s</text><text start="5844.0" dur="5.88">why I say we have to think of profit as</text><text start="5845.89" dur="6.99">one aspect of kind of power or rival</text><text start="5849.88" dur="7.16">risk dynamic more largely because it&apos;s I</text><text start="5852.88" dur="6.84">think government or academia

that</text><text start="6186.66" dur="4.11">profit had to be found abroad and so you</text><text start="6188.82" dur="6.06">had to loosen the bonds to your fellow</text><text start="6190.77"

and</text><text start="6200.88" dur="4.68">securitize and what I&apos;ve called the new</text><text start="6202.74" dur="6.0">gimmick economy so that right now we&apos;re</text><text start="6205.56"

dur="6.81">retribution for anyone who dissented</text><text start="6224.27" dur="7.42">famously a prominent trade theorist who</text><text start="6228.81" dur="6.0">was talking about the benefits

start="6393.88" dur="5.88">keep this in line it&apos;s to trivially easy</text><text start="6396.76" dur="6.84">to destroy individuals and my question</text><text start="6399.76" dur="5.07">has always been is there a program which</text><text start="6403.6" dur="4.53">I have tentatively called</text><text start="6404.83" dur="7.47">no living heroes and if you&apos;ve heard</text><text

start="6425.98" dur="4.32">self minted credibility in that he got</text><text start="6428.71" dur="4.13">into a plane and he flew it over an</text><text start="6430.3" dur="5.82">ocean solo and became a hero and that</text><text start="6432.84" dur="9.04">level of visibility allowed him to</text><text start="6436.12" dur="7.71">compete with the state okay I think that</text><text start="6441.88" dur="5.97">there was a program after Lindbergh that</text><text start="6443.83" dur="8.82">said individuals should not be able to</text><text start="6447.85" dur="7.5">amass sufficient mindshare to

dur="5.1">program that got started that said we&apos;re</text><text start="6460.09" dur="4.53">gonna wait and see if anything starts to</text><text start="6462.49" dur="4.32">bubble up that seems to

it&apos;s not</text><text start="7103.44" dur="4.83">the whole basis because then of course</text><text start="7106.14" dur="3.84">you still have incentive to figure out</text><text start="7108.27"

is</text><text start="7227.58" dur="4.74">I think that technology creation is</text><text start="7230.7" dur="3.84">something that we don&apos;t see happen in</text><text start="7232.32"

dur="6.18">think about here because I think it</text><text start="7258.36" dur="6.63">fundamentally changes our thinking on</text><text start="7262.47" dur="4.62">like social Darwinism and why markets</text><text start="7264.99" dur="5.28">are kind of a viable or an extra bolide</text><text start="7267.09" dur="3.87">eeeh is if we think about evolution as a</text><text start="7270.27" dur="3.96">process</text><text start="7270.96" dur="6.81">by which new things come about defined</text><text start="7274.23" dur="6.72">by mutation survival selection and then</text><text

creation in in evolution we see</text><text start="7289.23" dur="4.92">rivalry everywhere as you are mentioning</text><text start="7291.36" dur="6.24">in like biology there&apos;s a lot of really</text><text start="7294.15" dur="6.54">painful things to look at and I think</text><text start="7297.6" dur="6.3">we&apos;ve especially since Darwin modeled</text><text start="7300.69" dur="6.84">ourselves as apex predators for a long</text><text start="7303.9" dur="5.28">time and but I think and I think that we</text><text start="7307.53" dur="3.84">actually even reified the theory of</text><text start="7309.18" dur="5.49">markets with evolutionary biology to say</text><text start="7311.37" dur="5.19">that demand is like a niche and that the</text><text start="7314.67" dur="4.41">various versions of a product or a</text><text start="7316.56" dur="4.679">service are like mutations and the</text><text start="7319.08" dur="5.73">company that survives because it&apos;s able</text><text start="7321.239" dur="5.881">to supply the demand well those ideas</text><text start="7324.81" dur="4.409">and those technologies make it through</text><text start="7327.12" dur="3.66">and then if there&apos;s a couple that are</text><text start="7329.219" dur="3.121">mutually good we&apos;re merging would be</text><text start="7330.78" dur="3.87">good so you get a merger

that&apos;s kind of the way that a</text><text start="7345.75" dur="3.6">lot of people think about markets and</text><text start="7347.79" dur="3.03">relationship to evolution and I think</text><text

is that</text><text start="7858.81" dur="6.33">orcas get you part of the way there</text><text start="7862.05" dur="5.95">because they&apos;re a broadly distributed</text><text start="7865.14"

dur="4.53">the seas and I think the example there</text><text start="7914.92" dur="3.779">is just to think of an ocean trawler</text><text start="7916.57" dur="3.54">with a mile long drift net and the</text><text start="7918.699" dur="3.871">number of fish it pulls up compared to</text><text start="7920.11" dur="4.23">an orca and you realize that we can&apos;t</text><text start="7922.57"

or</text><text start="8128.199" dur="6.48">texting or whatever and so what I would</text><text start="8131.08" dur="6.21">say is that essential to human nature is</text><text start="8134.679" dur="5.581">the depth of nurture capacity relative</text><text start="8137.29" dur="5.429">to other species and so when I look at</text><text start="8140.26" dur="4.29">the thing we call human nature I look at</text><text start="8142.719" dur="4.261">how much I think the social sciences</text><text start="8144.55" dur="5.73">don&apos;t factor that there is Oba quit is</text><text start="8146.98"

start="8158.17" dur="4.23">correctly and now we&apos;re gonna just</text><text start="8159.61" dur="5.28">totally geek out we are the most case</text><text start="8162.4" dur="7.29">selective of

what that</text><text start="8206.76" dur="5.459">tells me is I look at some outliers on</text><text start="8209.88" dur="4.32">both sides of the bell curve of various</text><text start="8212.219"

the</text><text start="8235.02" dur="5.4">inexorability of violence in humans and</text><text start="8237.679" dur="5.051">then we look at say the Janjaweed or</text><text start="8240.42"

dur="4.41">conditioned to do both of those but then</text><text start="8253.41" dur="4.979">I see that we have a system where in</text><text start="8255.21" dur="7.679">general them as soon as a tribe

dur="5.939">easier to move than it was to war until</text><text start="8268.5" dur="5.31">we had moved everywhere in which case it</text><text start="8270.929" dur="4.951">was it started making sense to war and</text><text start="8273.81" dur="3.96">then as soon as any tribe militarized as</text><text start="8275.88" dur="2.82">every other tribe has to militarize or</text><text start="8277.77" dur="3.93">they lose by default</text><text start="8278.7" dur="4.83">and the game of power has begun in in</text><text start="8281.7" dur="6.269">earnest in that way the human on human</text><text start="8283.53" dur="7.08">game and I think we&apos;ve seen that the</text><text start="8287.969" dur="4.801">peaceful cultures largely got killed by</text><text start="8290.61" dur="3.72">the warring cultures and the warring</text><text start="8292.77" dur="4.29">cultures learn from each other how to be</text><text start="8294.33" dur="6.809">more successful at it and so the thing</text><text start="8297.06" dur="7.05">that we have now is something that has</text><text start="8301.139" dur="5.641">emerged through iterations on power</text><text start="8304.11" dur="4.05">dynamics and it&apos;s conditioning everyone</text><text start="8306.78" dur="3.06">within it and then we do all of our</text><text start="8308.16" dur="3.45">social studies within that and say this</text><text start="8309.84" dur="4.35">is human nature Wow</text><text start="8311.61" dur="5.609">so this is a very weird place to get</text><text start="8314.19" dur="5.01">brought back to because I&apos;m I&apos;m on the</text><text start="8317.219" dur="3.801">escape branch of our decision tree and</text><text start="8319.2" dur="8.04">what you&apos;re talking about</text><text start="8321.02"

in</text><text start="8396.149" dur="4.111">some of the Nordic countries and in</text><text start="8398.25" dur="3.63">Japan and he hadn&apos;t got to the point of</text><text start="8400.26" dur="4.08">seeing the phenomena that bring that</text><text start="8401.88" dur="5.7">about or the ability to recycle</text><text start="8404.34" dur="5.46">effectively and which means not a linear</text><text start="8407.58" dur="4.08">materials economy so I&apos;m starting is I&apos;m</text><text start="8409.8" dur="3.649">starting to guess where you&apos;re gonna go</text><text start="8411.66" dur="4.44">so if I if I understand you correctly</text><text start="8413.449" dur="4.181">the idea is that you&apos;re going to look at</text><text start="8416.1" dur="4.44">all of the places we&apos;ve been a little</text><text start="8417.63" dur="6.439">bit sloppy like recycling wasn&apos;t a place</text><text start="8420.54" dur="6.779">that we put too much attention and</text><text start="8424.069" dur="7.54">increasingly as we understand that stuff</text><text start="8427.319" dur="7.231">is limited we we have more of a reason</text><text start="8431.609" dur="6.33">to be careful about our land use rare</text><text start="8434.55" dur="5.91">rare resources I think I get that part</text><text start="8437.939" dur="7.141">of it then you have another idea here</text><text start="8440.46" dur="8.13">about development is kind of unused and</text><text start="8445.08" dur="5.13">we could do something far greater and</text><text start="8448.59" dur="6.3">then you just had another one as</text><text start="8450.21" dur="7.17">slipping my brain population oh that we</text><text start="8454.89" dur="4.53">would start to see fertility below</text><text start="8457.38" dur="4.08">replacement rates so that you would</text><text start="8459.42" dur="4.2">actually go into population decline as a</text><text start="8461.46" dur="4.71">means of taking pressure off of the</text><text start="8463.62" dur="5.88">system yeah so I see the possibility for</text><text start="8466.17" dur="5.64">a steady-state population</text><text start="8469.5" dur="5.58">that is within the carrying capacity of</text><text start="8471.81" dur="5.55">a closed-loop materials economy but that</text><text start="8475.08" dur="5.25">is fueled by renewable energy so you</text><text start="8477.36" dur="4.74">basically have a finite amount of atoms</text><text start="8480.33" dur="3.18">so you circle the atoms you don&apos;t have a</text><text start="8482.1" dur="2.52">finite amount of energy because you&apos;re</text><text start="8483.51" dur="3.18">getting more energy every day be of a</text><text start="8484.62" dur="3.42">finite amount per day and so you have to</text><text start="8486.69" dur="4.23">be able to cycle the atoms within the</text><text start="8488.04" dur="4.86">energy bandwidths and you&apos;re cycling it</text><text start="8490.92" dur="4.62">from one bit pattern into another bit</text><text start="8492.9" dur="4.29">pattern right like from one form into</text><text start="8495.54" dur="3.48">another form and the forms are stored as</text><text start="8497.19" dur="3.33">a bit so you have atoms energy and bits</text><text start="8499.02" dur="3.47">and you don&apos;t really have a limited</text><text start="8500.52" dur="6.36">number of the bits that you can have and</text><text start="8502.49" dur="6.49">so we can have a economy where it&apos;s</text><text start="8506.88" dur="4.23">getting continuously better but not by</text><text start="8508.98" dur="3.48">getting bigger but by getting better we</text><text start="8511.11" dur="3.33">continuously make more and more</text><text start="8512.46" dur="3.48">interesting things with the same format</text><text start="8514.44" dur="7.62">listen you&apos;ve always had the possibility</text><text start="8515.94" dur="10.68">of decoupling economic growth from let&apos;s</text><text start="8522.06" dur="7.7">say burning fossil fuels we just haven&apos;t</text><text start="8526.62" dur="7.47">gotten around to doing very well okay</text><text start="8529.76" dur="6.88">what I&apos;m starting to hear is that you</text><text start="8534.09" dur="6.63">believe potentially that maybe we should</text><text start="8536.64" dur="7.86">embrace declining populations as a means</text><text start="8540.72" dur="5.75">of either and I don&apos;t put words in your</text><text start="8544.5" dur="6.02">mouth but I&apos;m just trying to guess ahead</text><text start="8546.47" dur="7.63">one possibility is is that we need to</text><text start="8550.52" dur="5.68">amplify the people who can live</text><text start="8554.1" dur="4.14">peaceably and that maybe the idea is</text><text start="8556.2" dur="7.02">that people who can&apos;t live peaceably</text><text start="8558.24" dur="7.08">need to be incentivized to maybe have</text><text start="8563.22" dur="3.9">fabulous somatic lives but without</text><text start="8565.32" dur="6.27">reproducing I don&apos;t know so that we can</text><text start="8567.12" dur="6.21">drive certain traits towards zero maybe</text><text start="8571.59" dur="3.45">the idea is we just need to take ambient</text><text start="8573.33" dur="4.32">pressure off the system and so we need</text><text start="8575.04" dur="4.89">to go into a world where eight-billion</text><text start="8577.65" dur="6.72">becomes 6,000,000,000 becomes 1 billion</text><text start="8579.93" dur="8.37">and we start dropping down again I think</text><text start="8584.37" dur="5.1">we see that obviously birth rate is</text><text start="8588.3" dur="4.77">higher where there&apos;s poverty and we</text><text start="8589.47" dur="5.52">might lose some kids right and so as we</text><text start="8593.07" dur="6.29">just get out of abject poverty birth</text><text start="8594.99" dur="8.19">rates go down and then as total economic</text><text start="8599.36" dur="6.999">quality of life and the choice</text><text start="8603.18" dur="6.049">abilities for women and education and</text><text start="8606.359" dur="6.151">other things go up we start getting too</text><text start="8609.229" dur="5.5">much lower birth rates and no I&apos;m not</text><text start="8612.51" dur="4.29">concerned that the birth rate will just</text><text start="8614.729" dur="6.451">collapse forever we&apos;ll come to some</text><text start="8616.8" dur="6.57">steady-state birth rates but those are</text><text start="8621.18" dur="4.92">happening as a function of increased</text><text start="8623.37" dur="4.02">good things increased quality of life so</text><text start="8626.1" dur="4.16">in other words if you make the</text><text start="8627.39" dur="5.94">opportunity cost for

their whole life pregnant well</text><text start="8645.3" dur="6.54">look I mean the there&apos;s different issues</text><text start="8648.149" dur="5.851">with women not realizing that most of</text><text start="8651.84" dur="4.979">their children will survive which is</text><text start="8654.0" dur="5.189">happening in the demographic transition</text><text start="8656.819" dur="5.13">so people miscalculated for a period of</text><text start="8659.189" dur="5.55">time leading to fears about runaway</text><text start="8661.949" dur="4.2">population booms so that&apos;s that&apos;s one</text><text start="8664.739" dur="5.04">effect and then there&apos;s another one</text><text start="8666.149" dur="5.371">about if you give people education if</text><text start="8669.779" dur="4.051">you give if you educate women the</text><text start="8671.52" dur="4.74">opportunity costs of staying home and</text><text start="8673.83" dur="3.899">raising children starts to impress</text><text start="8676.26" dur="4.8">itself and so people will have fewer</text><text start="8677.729" dur="5.851">children yeah but I think where you&apos;re</text><text start="8681.06" dur="4.259">where you&apos;re headed is super interesting</text><text start="8683.58" dur="2.88">and part maybe it&apos;s one of the reasons</text><text start="8685.319" dur="5.37">that people might find it rather</text><text start="8686.46" dur="6.989">disturbing making life awesome for</text><text start="8690.689" dur="7.021">females might mean having far fewer</text><text start="8693.449" dur="6.361">children yep all right so that&apos;s a good</text><text start="8697.71" dur="5.22">thing in &apos;shmock did burgers well yeah</text><text start="8699.81" dur="5.58">this is so both I mean the Malthusian</text><text start="8702.93" dur="5.219">trap right the Malthusian situation is</text><text start="8705.39" dur="4.62">both the

dur="5.25">think the Buddhists got past one part of</text><text start="8896.94" dur="4.8">the Dunbar number if we think about it</text><text start="8900.24" dur="4.29">we think of a couple of

dur="8.34">that we are inexorably rival hrus can we</text><text start="9028.31" dur="5.79">take this weirdly into the the realm in</text><text start="9031.249" dur="6.061">which it is hardest to

Buddhism</text><text start="9096.54" dur="4.14">and why not an extra blue rival race and</text><text start="9098.49" dur="3.93">that then if they were to actually get</text><text start="9100.68" dur="3.45">the other side of the dunmer number</text><text start="9102.42" dur="3.18">which is not just getting care beyond</text><text start="9104.13" dur="4.05">the Dunbar number which they could

they couldn&apos;t because they didn&apos;t</text><text start="9111.57" dur="6.48">have the tech to do it and I&apos;m basically</text><text start="9114.45" dur="6.75">gonna say we can get something like abs</text><text start="9118.05" dur="4.38">oh well okay I&apos;ll do this X thing into</text><text start="9121.2" dur="5.52">Buddhism thing together cuz actually go</text><text start="9122.43" dur="6.54">together I think we get something like a</text><text start="9126.72" dur="4.92">certain level of empathy up to the</text><text start="9128.97" dur="4.29">Dunbar number just through mere neuron</text><text start="9131.64" dur="3.24">type effects through the fact that I</text><text start="9133.26" dur="3.48">know these people they know me we&apos;ve</text><text start="9134.88" dur="3.0">lived together if they&apos;re hurting I am</text><text start="9136.74" dur="4.41">gonna see it because they aren&apos;t</text><text start="9137.88" dur="5.46">somewhere far away okay and similarly</text><text start="9141.15" dur="4.11">I&apos;m less likely to pollute in an area</text><text start="9143.34" dur="3.09">I&apos;m in then through an industrial supply</text><text

dur="6.87">problem so I think the Buddhists were</text><text start="9162.15" dur="4.86">able to Train abstract empathy not just</text><text start="9165.12" dur="4.68">empathy for the people who I see hurting</text><text start="9167.01" dur="5.4">but empathy for all sentient beings</text><text start="9169.8" dur="4.71">throughout time and space right feeling</text><text start="9172.41"

right this</text><text start="9178.68" dur="4.62">is different religions have tried to do</text><text start="9182.01" dur="3.45">this but it&apos;s an example of a group</text><text start="9183.3" dur="6.6">succeeding at it where they were able to</text><text start="9185.46" dur="5.67">have a sense of positive coupling of my</text><text start="9189.9" dur="3.48">well-being in the well-being of another</text><text start="9191.13" dur="4.5">rather than inverse coupling they get</text><text start="9193.38" dur="5.25">ahead and it&apos;s decreasing my ability to</text><text start="9195.63" dur="5.04">get ahead what they the other side of</text><text start="9198.63" dur="3.809">the Dunbar number was not just who we</text><text start="9200.67" dur="4.559">care about but also our ability to</text><text start="9202.439" dur="4.321">coordinate and I don&apos;t think they were</text><text start="9205.229" dur="4.111">able to figure out coordination</text><text start="9206.76" dur="4.71">mechanisms that are adequately effective</text><text start="9209.34" dur="5.31">at scale okay I think if we do both of</text><text start="9211.47" dur="7.43">those things we can make a fundamentally</text><text start="9214.65" dur="7.5">different kind of civilization and</text><text start="9218.9" dur="5.8">rivalry mostly comes down to today</text><text start="9222.15" dur="4.56">private balance sheets which is I can</text><text start="9224.7" dur="3.06">get ahead economically and that money</text><text start="9226.71" dur="2.729">equals option</text><text

getting ahead and</text><text start="9233.49" dur="3.72">even at the expense of you getting ahead</text><text start="9235.08" dur="6.51">or the expense of the Commons right and</text><text start="9237.21" dur="7.38">so my near-term incentive can oftentimes</text><text start="9241.59" dur="5.76">be a long-term disadvantage to others of</text><text start="9244.59" dur="4.29">the whole so now this basis of where my</text><text start="9247.35" dur="3.719">well-being and the well-being of others</text><text start="9248.88" dur="5.189">were the Commons the Delta between those</text><text

costs keeps you</text><text start="9258.81" dur="5.759">know creating disinformation systems</text><text start="9260.97" dur="5.61">where we can&apos;t coordinate effectively so</text><text start="9264.569" dur="6.361">how we deal with the balance sheet part</text><text start="9266.58" dur="7.68">there&apos;s a few things right now for me to</text><text start="9270.93" dur="5.52">have access to stuff I have to mostly</text><text start="9274.26" dur="4.32">with a few exceptions possess the stuff</text><text start="9276.45" dur="5.25">right so possession and access are</text><text start="9278.58" dur="5.069">coupled and if I possess something I</text><text start="9281.7" dur="3.93">don&apos;t have to be using it I&apos;m just</text><text start="9283.649" dur="3.361">reserving

something means that I have</text><text start="9294.87" dur="4.529">access to it and means you don&apos;t have</text><text start="9296.34" dur="5.099">access to it and so with a finite

everybody</text><text start="9320.85" dur="4.35">bringing them so what matters is you</text><text start="9323.76" dur="3.84">having access to the shopping cart</text><text start="9325.2" dur="5.19">doesn&apos;t decrease my access and we start</text><text start="9327.6" dur="5.64">to see a potential for this if we think</text><text start="9330.39" dur="5.37">about something like an

by the things</text><text start="9373.62" dur="3.63">that you offer because you already have</text><text start="9375.99" dur="3.031">access to stuff so there&apos;s a</text><text start="9377.25"

metaphoric</text><text start="9705.42" dur="4.5">sense as just like let&apos;s say you and I</text><text start="9708.149" dur="3.661">were in the Bronze Age and we had just</text><text start="9709.92" dur="2.85">seen a larger war than had ever happened</text><text start="9711.81" dur="2.94">because there were some new better</text><text start="9712.77" dur="3.9">weapons Android shoot further

forever so this phase defined</text><text start="9740.22" dur="5.849">by increasing power on all sides used in</text><text start="9744.12" dur="5.04">destructive ways constructive narrowly</text><text start="9746.069" dur="4.981">but destructive broadly that phase comes</text><text start="9749.16" dur="3.27">to an end and there&apos;s something like a</text><text start="9751.05" dur="3.24">hard

actually good</text><text start="9770.34" dur="5.34">stewards of power so then the whole</text><text start="9772.92" dur="4.74">question for me becomes how do we make a</text><text start="9775.68" dur="3.87">social system like what is the the</text><text start="9777.66" dur="5.79">Bodhisattva engineering how do we make a</text><text start="9779.55" dur="5.37">social system that is conditioning

if anybody is doing the</text><text start="9800.609" dur="4.951">[ __ ] up thing that everybody has to do</text><text start="9802.26" dur="5.28">it and so I can start to think about</text><text start="9805.56" dur="4.65">what architectures such a system would</text><text start="9807.54" dur="4.739">have to have to be able to do sentence</text><text start="9810.21" dur="4.46">making as to what externalities would be</text><text start="9812.279" dur="5.79">and be able to internalize them and</text><text start="9814.67" dur="5.019">where then I can actually confer rights</text><text start="9818.069" dur="5.191">oice making and that we&apos;re developing</text><text start="9819.689" dur="5.431">humans so again think about the the</text><text start="9823.26" dur="3.69">education

there&apos;s good reason to think</text><text start="10571.579" dur="6.961">that there is a basis to do that in more</text><text start="10574.04" dur="6.779">areas so in a system where

dur="4.05">store then we need more shopping carts</text><text start="10615.89" dur="4.17">and so part of the answer is how do we</text><text start="10618.47" dur="3.3">actually increase the abundance
