dur="4.89">his experience of going to live with the</text><text start="92.49" dur="5.669">Pueblo Indians and how it completely</text><text start="95.189" dur="5.911">just blew apart his conception of what</text><text start="98.159" dur="5.281">was natural and how the Western world</text><text start="101.1" dur="6.18">view is different from other worldviews</text><text start="103.44" dur="6.9">and he noticed that they were so happy</text><text start="107.28" dur="4.8">and serene and they felt themselves as</text><text start="110.34" dur="3.3">one with their environment and they had</text><text start="112.08" dur="3.51">this very special relationship with the</text><text start="113.64" dur="4.05">Sun and it was just it was very</text><text start="115.59" dur="4.139">beautiful but at the same time he</text><text start="117.69" dur="5.28">realized how they were very vulnerable</text><text start="119.729" dur="5.611">to you know the invasion of the Western</text><text start="122.97" dur="4.349">civilization so if we create a new</text><text start="125.34" dur="4.41">civilization operating system that is</text><text start="127.319" dur="4.17">not oriented towards winning wars then</text><text start="129.75" dur="4.53">how do we ensure that it doesn&apos;t get</text><text start="131.489" dur="4.47">destroyed by those who are imagine</text><text start="134.28" dur="3.99">there&apos;s a group of people that get a</text><text start="135.959" dur="5.401">stronger theory of causation so they</text><text start="138.27" dur="4.98">learn Newton&apos;s physics and so now they</text><text start="141.36" dur="3.12">can use calculus to plot a ballistic</text><text start="143.25" dur="2.97">curve and make the cannon ball hit the</text><text start="144.48" dur="3.27">right spot every time rather than the</text><text start="146.22" dur="3.87">pendulum dowsing which is kind of a hit</text><text start="147.75" dur="4.5">or miss that belief is going to catch on</text><text start="150.09" dur="3.81">and that&apos;s why science really caught on</text><text start="152.25" dur="4.26">took us out of the Dark Ages was because</text><text start="153.9" dur="4.199">it led to better weapons and better</text><text start="156.51" dur="3.15">agriculture tech and better like real</text><text start="158.099" dur="3.75"> so it proliferated because it was</text><text start="159.66" dur="3.99">proliferative if we increased our theory</text><text start="161.849" dur="4.951">of causation that ends up catching on</text><text start="163.65" dur="5.1">but if we could increase our theory of</text><text start="166.8" dur="3.45">causation and our theory of choice and</text><text start="168.75" dur="3.599">the relationship between them that would</text><text start="170.25" dur="3.84">actually be the most adaptive especially</text><text start="172.349" dur="5.22">in the presence of where a particular</text><text start="174.09" dur="5.1">game theoretic model of choice with the</text><text start="177.569" dur="3.331">extension of causation we have is</text><text start="179.19" dur="4.62">definitely self terminating definitely</text><text start="180.9" dur="4.589">anti adaptive and so I know we&apos;ve been</text><text start="183.81" dur="3.45">on for a long time so there&apos;s really</text><text start="185.489" dur="3.661">only one more thing that I want to share</text><text start="187.26" dur="5.239">that kind of closes this set of concepts</text><text start="189.15" dur="5.309">so remember we said that any source of</text><text start="192.499" dur="4.541">asymmetric advantage competitive</text><text start="194.459" dur="4.801">advantage in a win-lose game will end up</text><text start="197.04" dur="3.779">once it&apos;s deployed being figured out in</text><text start="199.26" dur="4.83">utilized by everybody you just up the</text><text start="200.819" dur="5.64">level of fancy and playing field so but</text><text start="204.09" dur="3.63">we also said the Indians you were just</text><text start="206.459" dur="4.89">mentioning and many of the treasures</text><text start="207.72" dur="5.519">we&apos;ve mentioned lost win lose games we</text><text start="211.349" dur="3.78">don&apos;t want to try and build something</text><text start="213.239" dur="4.681">that&apos;s just going to lose at a win-lose</text><text start="215.129" dur="4.47">game but we know that if it tries to win</text><text start="217.92" dur="3.209">at win-lose games it&apos;s just still part</text><text start="219.599" dur="5.25">of the same existential curve that we&apos;re</text><text start="221.129" dur="6.061">on so it has to not lose at a win-lose</text><text start="224.849" dur="4.321">game while also not seeking to win but</text><text start="227.19" dur="3.93">do it so it&apos;s basically not playing the</text><text start="229.17" dur="4.409">game but it is oriented about how not to</text><text start="231.12" dur="6.75">lose this is a very important thing and</text><text start="233.579" dur="5.671">so we can think about power the way we</text><text start="237.87" dur="4.199">have traditionally thought of power is a</text><text start="239.25" dur="4.89">power over or power against type dynamic</text><text start="242.069" dur="4.26">a game theoretic win-lose dynamic and</text><text start="244.14" dur="3.569">that that any agent that deploys a</text><text start="246.329" dur="3.24">particular kind of power leads to other</text><text start="247.709" dur="3.9">agents for you on how to deploy the same</text><text start="249.569" dur="4.2">and other kinds of powered power keeps</text><text start="251.609" dur="3.66">it anting up till we get to problems but</text><text start="253.769" dur="3.391">we could think about another term we</text><text start="255.269" dur="3.9">might call strength which is not the</text><text start="257.16" dur="3.99">power to beat someone else but it&apos;s the</text><text start="259.169" dur="4.171">ability to not be beat by someone else</text><text start="261.15" dur="4.17">it&apos;s the ability to maintain our own</text><text start="263.34" dur="5.16">sovereignty and our own coherence in the</text><text start="265.32" dur="4.59">presence of outside forces and so we can</text><text start="268.5" dur="3.33">talk about my power like can I go beat</text><text start="269.91" dur="6.96">somebody up but my strength is can my</text><text start="271.83" dur="6.809">body fend off viruses and can I fend off</text><text start="276.87" dur="3.39">cancers and can I actually protect</text><text start="278.639" dur="2.701">myself if I need to protect myself which</text><text start="280.26" dur="4.5">is different than can I go beat other</text><text start="281.34" dur="5.79">people up and now the power game is the</text><text start="284.76" dur="4.23">game we actually have to cure power over</text><text start="287.13" dur="3.69">dynamics mean rivalry sign AMEX mean</text><text start="288.99" dur="3.78">when loose dynamics is the source of</text><text start="290.82" dur="4.02">evil it&apos;s not that money is the source</text><text start="292.77" dur="5.76">of evil it&apos;s that power over where I</text><text start="294.84" dur="5.82">think my well-being is ante coupled to</text><text start="298.53" dur="3.78">yours ends up being the source of evil</text><text start="300.66" dur="4.319">and money&apos;s just very deep in the stack</text><text start="302.31" dur="4.71">of power dynamics but statuses and</text><text start="304.979" dur="3.571">certain ways of relating to sex and the</text><text start="307.02" dur="3.269">number of things are so we have to get</text><text start="308.55" dur="2.94">rid of the power over dynamics but it</text><text start="310.289" dur="3.841">doesn&apos;t mean that I can&apos;t develop</text><text start="311.49" dur="5.399">strength that makes me anti fragile in</text><text start="314.13" dur="5.37">the presence of rivalry and then I say</text><text start="316.889" dur="4.53">well what kind of capacity can I</text><text start="319.5" dur="4.289">developed it doesn&apos;t get weaponized by</text><text start="321.419" dur="4.531">somebody else and used against me given</text><text start="323.789" dur="2.851">that any asymmetric capacity I get can</text><text start="325.95" dur="3.089">be weaponized</text><text start="326.64" dur="3.749">there&apos;s really only one and this is a</text><text start="329.039" dur="5.581">really interesting thing</text><text start="330.389" dur="5.221">if I make the adaptive capacity of they</text><text start="334.62" dur="4.5">were trying to make a new civilization</text><text start="335.61" dur="5.339">as a model and the new full-stack</text><text start="339.12" dur="3.269">civilization new economics new</text><text start="340.949" dur="4.44">governance new infrastructure new</text><text start="342.389" dur="4.74">culture that has comprehensive loop</text><text start="345.389" dur="3.631">closure right doesn&apos;t create</text><text start="347.129" dur="5.521">accumulation or depletion doesn&apos;t have</text><text start="349.02" dur="5.519">rival risk games within it etc if I try</text><text start="352.65" dur="5.28">to have some unique adaptive capacity</text><text start="354.539" dur="5.011">via certain type of information tech the</text><text start="357.93" dur="3.359">other world will see that information</text><text start="359.55" dur="3.989">Tekken is it for all kinds of purposes</text><text start="361.289" dur="4.081">including against me where there&apos;s an</text><text start="363.539" dur="3.78">incentive to do so and the same is true</text><text start="365.37" dur="8.159">if I used military tech or if I use</text><text start="367.319" dur="7.771">environmental extraction technology the</text><text start="373.529" dur="3.901">advantage of the way the civilization</text><text start="375.09" dur="4.59">structured has to do with increased</text><text start="377.43" dur="3.81">coherence in the sense making and choice</text><text start="379.68" dur="3.06">making between all the agents in the</text><text start="381.24" dur="5.1">system all the people in the system</text><text start="382.74" dur="6.359">increase interpersonal coherence this</text><text start="386.34" dur="4.919">cannot be weaponized and anyone else</text><text start="389.099" dur="5.521">employing it is now just a system itself</text><text start="391.259" dur="5.97">propagating so for instance when we</text><text start="394.62" dur="4.56">start playing rival risk games we start</text><text start="397.229" dur="4.05">realizing that it&apos;s not just us against</text><text start="399.18" dur="4.349">somebody else it&apos;s teams against larger</text><text start="401.279" dur="3.931">teams right answer them the idea of the</text><text start="403.529" dur="3.211">team is we&apos;re supposed to cooperate with</text><text start="405.21" dur="3.989">each other to compete against somebody</text><text start="406.74" dur="4.649">else but compete against someone else</text><text start="409.199" dur="3.601">idea ends up going fractal and I end up</text><text start="411.389" dur="3.81">even competing against my teammates</text><text start="412.8" dur="3.869">sometimes and that&apos;s part of that why</text><text start="415.199" dur="4.47">the collective intelligence doesn&apos;t</text><text start="416.669" dur="4.411">scale thing is because ou cooperate with</text><text start="419.669" dur="3.691">my other buddies on the basketball team</text><text start="421.08" dur="4.41">unless there&apos;s also a thing called the</text><text start="423.36" dur="3.63">most valuable player and I&apos;m in the</text><text start="425.49" dur="3.329">running for it and I have a chance to</text><text start="426.99" dur="4.019">make the three-point shot rather than</text><text start="428.819" dur="4.171">pass even though it decreases the chance</text><text start="431.009" dur="4.53">of the team winning now I have a</text><text start="432.99" dur="4.109">incentive misalignment so I might go for</text><text start="435.539" dur="3.6">that and then it gets bigger where</text><text start="437.099" dur="4.74">there&apos;s a couple of us that both want</text><text start="439.139" dur="4.65">the same promotion to the same position</text><text start="441.839" dur="4.23">at the company and we&apos;re actually going</text><text start="443.789" dur="4.68">to try and sabotage the other one even</text><text start="446.069" dur="4.831">though that harms the company because my</text><text start="448.469" dur="4.831">own incentive is not coupled with their</text><text start="450.9" dur="4.919">incentive and with the company and then</text><text start="453.3" dur="4.41">I can look at say a couple different</text><text start="455.819" dur="4.111">government agencies that are competing</text><text start="457.71" dur="3.959">for the same chunk of budget it will</text><text start="459.93" dur="3.029">actually seek to undermine each other so</text><text start="461.669" dur="2.3">they get more of the budget when they&apos;re</text><text start="462.959" dur="3.14">supposed to be on the same</text><text start="463.969" dur="4.41">called that country and so what we</text><text start="466.099" dur="4.86">realized as we get this thing called you</text><text start="468.379" dur="5.37">know like fractal disinformation fractal</text><text start="470.959" dur="4.05">decoherence and defection happening</text><text start="473.749" dur="3.45">everywhere and that creates the most</text><text start="475.009" dur="4.23">broken information ecology and the least</text><text start="477.199" dur="4.26">effective coordination and cooperation</text><text start="479.239" dur="4.29">possible and that&apos;s everywhere right</text><text start="481.459" dur="5.25">that&apos;s ubiquitous and it&apos;s the result of</text><text start="483.529" dur="5.76">that underlying rivalry so as we</text><text start="486.709" dur="4.44">mentioned before now if I have some</text><text start="489.289" dur="3.18">information I want to make it to where</text><text start="491.149" dur="3.48">nobody else can use it I&apos;m gonna</text><text start="492.469" dur="5.37">trademark it patented protect my</text><text start="494.629" dur="4.5">intellectual property and before I&apos;ve</text><text start="497.839" dur="3.09">released it I actually want to dis</text><text start="499.129" dur="3.3">inform everybody else about it right</text><text start="500.929" dur="3.39">tell them the gold is somewhere else so</text><text start="502.429" dur="3.54">that they go dig in someone else and</text><text start="504.319" dur="4.8">don&apos;t pay attention when I&apos;m doing so if</text><text start="505.969" dur="5.07">I am both hoarding information dis</text><text start="509.119" dur="2.97">informing others and keeping my</text><text start="511.039" dur="3.18">information from being able to be</text><text start="512.089" dur="4.711">synthesized with others that means that</text><text start="514.219" dur="4.531">I&apos;m going to not let my knowledge about</text><text start="516.8" dur="3.599">cancer research and whatever it is be</text><text start="518.75" dur="4.829">out there because I got to make the farm</text><text start="520.399" dur="5.151">on your back so the best computer that</text><text start="523.579" dur="5.99">the world could build

is</text><text start="549.8" dur="4.139">having to reproduce the same work</text><text start="551.629" dur="4.531">because we don&apos;t want to share our best</text><text start="553.939"

you to meet some people</text><text start="2030.88" dur="5.58">that you know to get my network ahead or</text><text start="2033.91" dur="5.07">to get some knowledge from you or to</text><text

instrument towards</text><text start="2043.18" dur="7.08">you&apos;re a path towards to utilitarian</text><text start="2045.61" dur="6.78">ethic then you are a into a means for me</text><text start="2050.26" dur="4.41">so however I relate with you however it</text><text start="2052.39" dur="4.5">affects your own sovereign sentient</text><text start="2054.67" dur="4.26">experience is a

dur="7.139">and so in a healthy world world of the</text><text start="2065.929" dur="6.121">future other people need to have</text><text start="2069.379" dur="5.04">intrinsic value independent of</text><text start="2072.05" dur="4.2">utilitarian value to everyone that&apos;s a</text><text start="2074.419" dur="5.01">part of the culture and not just the</text><text start="2076.25" dur="5.73">other people and other beings all kinds</text><text start="2079.429" dur="4.17">of sentient beings but relationships</text><text start="2081.98" dur="3.149">have intrinsic values so I&apos;m gonna</text><text start="2083.599" dur="3.481">invest in the integrity of our</text><text start="2085.129" dur="4.53">relationship independent of me getting</text><text start="2087.08" dur="4.349">anything out of it because it is</text><text start="2089.659" dur="5.071">actually the basis of meaningfulness</text><text start="2091.429" dur="5.19">itself which is why in a utilitarian and</text><text start="2094.73" dur="3.09">instrumental dynamic we&apos;re getting ahead</text><text start="2096.619" dur="3.48">while feeling utterly</text><text start="2097.82" dur="4.86">meaningless and destroying everything</text><text start="2100.099" dur="6.211">that is meaningful in the process that</text><text start="2102.68" dur="5.909">is us being hooked to addiction to a</text><text start="2106.31" dur="5.01">stupid game where what we think we want</text><text start="2108.589" dur="5.25">is not not what we actually want and</text><text start="2111.32" dur="5.46">what we think of as a win is actually a</text><text start="2113.839" dur="5.52">Omni stupid thing and this is why you</text><text start="2116.78" dur="4.38">know like the the Hindu concept of</text><text start="2119.359" dur="4.051">Dharma was a virtue ethics not a</text><text start="2121.16" dur="4.98">utilitarian ethic and and there was a</text><text start="2123.41" dur="5.22">very

and if you try and</text><text start="2136.22" dur="2.91">just figure out the outcome is gonna be</text><text start="2137.51" dur="3.15">you&apos;re gonna be wrong a lot of times and</text><text start="2139.13" dur="5.19">you&apos;re also gonna justify a lot of</text><text start="2140.66" dur="6.3">unethical styles and utilitarianism is</text><text start="2144.32" dur="3.9">kind of the rampant ethics that anyone</text><text start="2146.96" dur="2.73">who&apos;s paying attention to ethics pays</text><text start="2148.22" dur="4.2">attention to right now and it&apos;s not</text><text start="2149.69" dur="4.89">without any merit but it is also</text><text start="2152.42" dur="4.83">problematic it is up there with</text><text start="2154.58" dur="4.32">democracy and capitalism you know in the</text><text start="2157.25" dur="3.72">philosophy of science in terms of being</text><text start="2158.9" dur="4.32">a problematic thing to be the dominant</text><text start="2160.97" dur="3.899">system because we cannot actually</text><text start="2163.22" dur="4.58">predict and complex systems well enough</text><text start="2164.869" dur="6.691">to do a utilitarian thing and they</text><text start="2167.8" dur="5.95">intrinsic dynamics of a relationship and</text><text start="2171.56" dur="5.57">another being in that becoming moved to</text><text start="2173.75" dur="6.9">being a means to an end other than them</text><text start="2177.13" dur="5.86">and as soon as I start factoring</text><text start="2180.65" dur="4.08">everything meaningful along the chain of</text><text start="2182.99" dur="3.75">whatever I think my howcome is to where</text><text start="2184.73" dur="4.08">my outcome is actually being in a way</text><text start="2186.74" dur="4.95">that is an integrity with an honoring of</text><text start="2188.81" dur="5.36">all life now it&apos;s the virtue of it yeah</text><text start="2191.69" dur="4.21">I I was having this

optimizing everything and</text><text start="2200.91" dur="3.36">when they get into that mindset</text><text start="2202.14" dur="4.439">eventually they get to what what they</text><text start="2204.27" dur="4.11">call optimizing relationships and then</text><text start="2206.579" dur="3.51">they start putting people on a value</text><text start="2208.38" dur="3.419">hierarchy where they want to interact</text><text start="2210.089" dur="3.421">with high-value people and they want to</text><text start="2211.799" dur="4.02">get a high value woman and they&apos;re using</text><text

those people in my experience</text><text start="2221.88" dur="4.439">are some of the most existentially</text><text start="2223.98" dur="5.25">unhappy people that I&apos;ve met and they</text><text
