so we&apos;re gonna have</text><text start="131.8" dur="3.93">a lot of things to talk about today but</text><text start="133.24" dur="5.01">why don&apos;t we start by talking about an</text><text start="135.73" dur="4.65">optimistic future of humanity and what</text><text start="138.25" dur="3.99">we need to do to transition into that</text><text start="140.38" dur="4.32">future there are a lot of visions and</text><text start="142.24" dur="5.31">theories out there about the ultimate</text><text start="144.7" dur="4.92">macro system that we need to adopt not</text><text start="147.55" dur="4.98">only to survive the century but to</text><text start="149.62" dur="5.04">thrive what is your vision of that first</text><text start="152.53" dur="4.53">I wouldn&apos;t talk in terms of an ultimate</text><text start="154.66" dur="4.65">system talk in terms of ongoing</text><text start="157.06" dur="4.71">evolution and so rather than kind of a</text><text start="159.31" dur="3.78">utopian as one has previously thought of</text><text start="161.77" dur="4.05">a perfected system we&apos;re going to think</text><text start="163.09" dur="5.88">of a proto pian process right a process</text><text start="165.82" dur="5.13">of emergence into more elegantly ordered</text><text start="168.97" dur="4.35">complexity that has more and more</text><text start="170.95" dur="4.41">emergent properties and more of the</text><text start="173.32" dur="3.81">things we&apos;re interested in and gets over</text><text start="175.36" dur="4.14">some of the underlying causes of things</text><text start="177.13" dur="4.47">we want to get past I would say that</text><text start="179.5" dur="5.0">rather than just iterative evolution we</text><text start="181.6" dur="7.53">are on the brink of a phase shift and</text><text start="184.5" dur="8.68">phase shift defined by core axioms and</text><text start="189.13" dur="6.72">core foundations of most of our macro</text><text start="193.18" dur="4.38">global systems from our worldview to our</text><text start="195.85" dur="3.389">economics to our governance to our</text><text start="197.56" dur="3.27">infrastructure going through</text><text start="199.239" dur="4.47">foundational shifts so this looks like a</text><text start="200.83" dur="5.85">step function in evolution where we have</text><text start="203.709" dur="4.951">had capitalism that has gone through</text><text start="206.68" dur="4.26">kind of iterative developmental</text><text start="208.66" dur="3.78">processes and we&apos;ve had representative</text><text start="210.94" dur="3.42">democracy that&apos;s gone through iterative</text><text start="212.44" dur="4.71">developmental processes and you know</text><text start="214.36" dur="5.67">scientific methodology and worldview and</text><text start="217.15" dur="5.809">etc now we are on the brink of something</text><text start="220.03" dur="5.519">that requires larger more fundamental</text><text start="222.959" dur="6.521">axiomatic and structural shift and so we</text><text start="225.549" dur="6.841">can talk about what the criteria for the</text><text start="229.48" dur="4.89">other side of that have to look like for</text><text start="232.39" dur="5.22">it to be a non-self terminating system</text><text start="234.37" dur="6.36">and for it to be a anti fragile system</text><text start="237.61" dur="5.939">and those are two of the important</text><text start="240.73" dur="4.259">criteria of any kind of world that is</text><text start="243.549" dur="3.66">interesting for anyone right</text><text start="244.989" dur="4.351">it is definitely non-self terminating</text><text start="247.209" dur="4.141">and then not anti fragile then there&apos;s</text><text start="249.34" dur="4.29">more things we&apos;ll talk about on top of</text><text start="251.35" dur="5.639">that so you want to talk about what</text><text start="253.63" dur="5.159">those criteria must be well sure but</text><text start="256.989" dur="3.511">first let&apos;s define the problem so what&apos;s</text><text start="258.789" dur="1.95">wrong with our current system and why do</text><text start="260.5" dur="2.43">we</text><text start="260.739" dur="5.041">to transition out of it so when we say</text><text start="262.93" dur="4.799">our current system we are sweeping a lot</text><text start="265.78" dur="4.199">of things together and it&apos;s worth kind</text><text start="267.729" dur="3.961">of pulling those apart a bit we might be</text><text start="269.979" dur="4.291">talking about macroeconomics which</text><text start="271.69" dur="5.009">obviously the macroeconomics of China</text><text start="274.27" dur="3.929">and the macroeconomics of Russia the</text><text start="276.699" dur="4.31">macroeconomics of the United States if</text><text start="278.199" dur="7.351">NATO are different systems but there are</text><text start="281.009" dur="8.111">kind of beyond national global economic</text><text start="285.55" dur="5.73">systems that we can we can look at we</text><text start="289.12" dur="3.66">can look at governance systems again</text><text start="291.28" dur="3.449">national and then transnational</text><text start="292.78" dur="3.359">governance and then beyond anything</text><text start="294.729" dur="3.93">that&apos;s codified how human</text><text start="296.139" dur="3.78">decision-making works right we can think</text><text start="298.659" dur="2.491">of governance in the highest sense of</text><text start="299.919" dur="4.171">how do we do collective decision-making</text><text start="301.15" dur="4.59">at various scales from a business to a</text><text start="304.09" dur="4.169">family to a nation to groups of Nations</text><text start="305.74" dur="3.829">to a species as a whole navigating</text><text start="308.259" dur="3.211">things that face the whole species</text><text start="309.569" dur="4.541">economics we can think about how do we</text><text start="311.47" dur="4.8">do resource allocation and how do we do</text><text start="314.11" dur="3.959">human incentive systems with</text><text start="316.27" dur="3.42">infrastructure we can talk about how do</text><text start="318.069" dur="2.85">we meet our physical needs and</text><text start="319.69" dur="3.96">relationship with the physical planet</text><text start="320.919" dur="6.421">right education medicines we have a lot</text><text start="323.65" dur="6.84">of different systems that Co evolved and</text><text start="327.34" dur="6.75">they are interconnected and Entering and</text><text start="330.49" dur="6.479">then you can think of a you know kind of</text><text start="334.09" dur="4.23">evolving paradigm that involves all of</text><text start="336.969" dur="4.341">those things but we&apos;re gonna need to</text><text start="338.32" dur="6.39">talk about at least the core ones in</text><text start="341.31" dur="5.079">distinction from each other so what is</text><text start="344.71" dur="5.13">the problem we&apos;re trying to fix well one</text><text start="346.389" dur="5.25">thing is those current systems the</text><text start="349.84" dur="3.799">interface of those current systems with</text><text start="351.639" dur="4.891">each other and the net effects are</text><text start="353.639" dur="5.471">unsustainable and unsustainable means</text><text start="356.53" dur="6.479">self terminating means that these</text><text start="359.11" dur="6.359">systems run to their own end and then</text><text start="363.009" dur="3.9">fall off some kind of cliff right and so</text><text start="365.469" dur="3.6">when we look at growth curves of</text><text start="366.909" dur="3.331">different kinds of organisms anytime we</text><text start="369.069" dur="3.66">see a growth curve that has an</text><text start="370.24" dur="5.82">exponential up that is not forever</text><text start="372.729" dur="5.43">and sometimes the exponential up goes</text><text start="376.06" dur="4.55">logistic and that&apos;s very nice sometimes</text><text start="378.159" dur="4.681">it drops off pretty hard before it</text><text start="380.61" dur="4.799">logistics sometimes it goes through a</text><text start="382.84" dur="4.859">lot of unstability you sometimes just</text><text start="385.409" dur="6.43">Exponential&apos;s up and then drops off a</text><text start="387.699" dur="5.281">cliff right so we were under half a</text><text start="391.839" dur="3.991">billion popularly</text><text start="392.98" dur="6.03">for all of human history as far as we</text><text start="395.83" dur="5.88">know 200 plus thousand years until the</text><text start="399.01" dur="7.38">Industrial Revolution and then in just</text><text start="401.71" dur="6.74">over 200 years we went up to over 7</text><text start="406.39" dur="4.68">billion people and growing and that is a</text><text start="408.45" dur="4.42">profound exponential population curve</text><text start="411.07" dur="3.78">not only have we went through this</text><text start="412.87" dur="4.71">profound exponential population curve in</text><text start="414.85" dur="5.88">relationship to our ability to extract</text><text start="417.58" dur="5.22">resources from the planet that are not</text><text start="420.73" dur="3.53">replenishing themselves which is what</text><text start="422.8" dur="4.83">the Industrial Revolution was right</text><text start="424.26" dur="5.95">mining farming fishing logging etc the</text><text start="427.63" dur="5.31">ability to take some kind of resource</text><text start="430.21" dur="5.58">reserves that took hundreds of millions</text><text start="432.94" dur="5.61">or billions of years to develop and to</text><text start="435.79" dur="5.7">be able to extract them at a radically</text><text start="438.55" dur="4.41">fast pace and obviously much faster than</text><text start="441.49" dur="3.99">they can renew and then the population</text><text start="442.96" dur="4.2">is growing on that savings account until</text><text start="445.48" dur="4.68">you hit the end of a savings account and</text><text start="447.16" dur="4.83">then there&apos;s real problems not only have</text><text start="450.16" dur="4.11">we been growing in population but we&apos;ve</text><text start="451.99" dur="5.84">been growing in resource consumption per</text><text start="454.27" dur="6.42">capita so this is a multiplicative issue</text><text start="457.83" dur="4.93">that we are getting near the end of the</text><text start="460.69" dur="4.89">viability of that particular part of</text><text start="462.76" dur="5.55">right when we think about running an</text><text start="465.58" dur="5.81">economy it requires a year-over-year</text><text start="468.31" dur="4.98">growth requires it because your</text><text start="471.39" dur="3.94">fractional izing the monetary supply</text><text start="473.29" dur="3.48">even deeper than that just interest</text><text start="475.33" dur="4.38">where the monetary supply has to</text><text start="476.77" dur="4.92">fundamentally expand right then to not</text><text start="479.71" dur="3.95">debase the currency you have to increase</text><text start="481.69" dur="5.01">the total amount of goods and services</text><text start="483.66" dur="5.77">services sit on top of product economies</text><text start="486.7" dur="5.58">which relate to a linear materials</text><text start="489.43" dur="4.32">economy product materials economy which</text><text start="492.28" dur="3.41">the linear materials economy means</text><text start="493.75" dur="4.23">extracting resources from the planet</text><text start="495.69" dur="4.18">unruhe notably which means devastation</text><text start="497.98" dur="5.07">of ecosystems and things like that and</text><text start="499.87" dur="4.68">then turning them into trash in ways</text><text start="503.05" dur="3.54">that usually consume a good bit of</text><text start="504.55" dur="3.93">energy from dirty sources create a lot</text><text start="506.59" dur="3.87">of pollution and externalize harm to</text><text start="508.48" dur="3.93">people environments along the way you</text><text start="510.46" dur="4.7">know and then end with waste so that</text><text start="512.41" dur="5.88">kind of exponential growth economy and</text><text start="515.16" dur="5.72">attach to a linear materials economy</text><text start="518.29" dur="4.51">just doesn&apos;t work ongoing Leon</text><text start="520.88" dur="3.69">my planet right it only would work</text><text start="522.8" dur="4.49">ongoingly on an infinite playing field</text><text start="524.57" dur="6.3">which were not on and so that is a</text><text start="527.29" dur="5.8">fundamentally self terminating system it</text><text start="530.87" dur="4.02">makes plenty of sense that when there</text><text start="533.09" dur="4.65">was just so much low-hanging fruit in</text><text start="534.89" dur="4.29">terms of coal and oil and fish and trees</text><text start="537.74" dur="3.81">and etc that we would do this</text><text start="539.18" dur="4.47">exponential boom kind of thing it&apos;s just</text><text start="541.55" dur="3.75">that&apos;s not viable anymore</text><text start="543.65" dur="3.33">it also happens to be that the</text><text start="545.3" dur="4.32">technologies that would allow us to be</text><text start="546.98" dur="4.53">really viable in a post growth economic</text><text start="549.62" dur="4.68">system it&apos;s not about net more</text><text start="551.51" dur="4.89">consumption but about using the same</text><text start="554.3" dur="5.82">things in a closed-loop materials</text><text start="556.4" dur="5.97">economy in ever more interesting ways so</text><text start="560.12" dur="5.52">a materials economy that is closed-loop</text><text start="562.37" dur="6.09">post growth and upcycling continuously</text><text start="565.64" dur="4.35">upcycling the technology it takes to do</text><text start="568.46" dur="3.99">that is technology we are just now</text><text start="569.99" dur="4.05">getting happens to be that that&apos;s at the</text><text start="572.45" dur="3.81">same time that we are just now getting</text><text start="574.04" dur="4.59">to the point of self-determination of</text><text start="576.26" dur="5.64">the old system right so we both have to</text><text start="578.63" dur="6.81">shift and can at the same time the</text><text start="581.9" dur="6.99">technologies it takes to build this kind</text><text start="585.44" dur="6.6">of sustainable regenerative thriving new</text><text start="588.89" dur="7.29">set of world systems is technology that</text><text start="592.04" dur="5.97">we developed via capitalism and linear</text><text start="596.18" dur="3.87">materials economy and the military</text><text start="598.01" dur="4.74">industrial complex and all those things</text><text start="600.05" dur="5.04">so they served in evolutionary relevance</text><text start="602.75" dur="4.5">in terms of where we&apos;re going and they</text><text start="605.09" dur="4.23">have just completed a particular</text><text start="607.25" dur="3.72">evolutionary relevant lifecycle now</text><text start="609.32" dur="3.36">we&apos;re going through a discrete phase</text><text start="610.97" dur="4.68">shift into a new life cycle very much</text><text start="612.68" dur="5.1">like a fetal time period right in the</text><text start="615.65" dur="3.69">embryonic time period is unsustainable</text><text start="617.78" dur="3.33">the caterpillar can&apos;t just keep</text><text start="619.34" dur="4.11">devastating its ecosystem without</text><text start="621.11" dur="2.76">pollinating forever but that&apos;s not how</text><text start="623.45" dur="2.43">it works</text><text start="623.87" dur="4.41">and the baby couldn&apos;t stay in the belly</text><text start="625.88" dur="3.21">after 40 weeks and parasitically but</text><text start="628.28" dur="4.05">that&apos;s not how it works</text><text start="629.09" dur="6.21">it is going through a period where its</text><text start="632.33" dur="4.83">system is fundamentally not capable of</text><text start="635.3" dur="3.75">the kinds of autonomy that it will later</text><text start="637.16" dur="5.1">be capable of so it&apos;s a finite</text><text start="639.05" dur="5.04">evolutionary period of unsustainable</text><text start="642.26" dur="4.74">development to then go through a</text><text start="644.09" dur="5.249">discrete phase shift to then be in a</text><text start="647.0" dur="4.35">fundamentally new period and so I think</text><text start="649.339" dur="3.541">it&apos;s a very fair analogy to look at</text><text start="651.35" dur="3.42">humanity as having been</text><text start="652.88" dur="3.66">the kind of embryonic period Bucky</text><text start="654.77" dur="3.39">fuller used to like to speak to it like</text><text

dur="4.891">things they have to overcome and if you</text><text start="3246.88" dur="6.239">think about the way most people have</text><text start="3249.19" dur="6.089">been raised as children we very rarely</text><text start="3253.119" dur="5.7">got punished for doing what that</text><text start="3255.279" dur="5.22">authorities wanted us to do and most all</text><text start="3258.819" dur="3.72">of the times we got punished or for</text><text start="3260.499" dur="4.921">doing things that we wanted to that</text><text start="3262.539" dur="6.99">maybe appeal to our own

dur="4.101">rewarded was for doing things the</text><text start="3273.369" dur="4.591">authorities either wanted us to do or</text><text start="3275.88" dur="4.119">you know we&apos;re at least aligned with</text><text start="3277.96" dur="3.75">what they figured what we figured from</text><text start="3279.999" dur="3.72">previous expressions they probably want</text><text start="3281.71" dur="3.299">us to do and so this is a very deep</text><text start="3283.719" dur="5.04">conditioning when we are most</text><text start="3285.009" dur="7.11">susceptible to conditioning to look to</text><text start="3288.759" dur="4.711">others to look to teachers and Sunday</text><text start="3292.119" dur="3.721">school leaders and parents</text><text start="3293.47" dur="5.52">you know authorities to tell us how to</text><text start="3295.84" dur="4.83">live our lives and when we touched our</text><text start="3298.99" dur="3.18">bodies we found that the parts of our</text><text start="3300.67" dur="2.97">bodies that fell best to touch with the</text><text start="3302.17" dur="1.89">parts that we got most in trouble for</text><text start="3303.64" dur="4.32">touching</text><text start="3304.06" dur="6.39">so obviously what feels good to us is</text><text start="3307.96" dur="4.889">bad so we can&apos;t trust our feelings but</text><text start="3310.45" dur="3.84">the authorities know that it&apos;s bad so we</text><text start="3312.849" dur="4.411">can apparently trust the authorities but</text><text start="3314.29" dur="5.4">not our feelings and no one has ever</text><text start="3317.26" dur="5.55">really interested in our thoughts or</text><text start="3319.69" dur="4.59">perspectives they were pre defined right</text><text start="3322.81" dur="3.18">answers to things and we got praised</text><text start="3324.28" dur="3.839">when we got them and we got in trouble</text><text start="3325.99" dur="3.77">and we didn&apos;t get them and people were</text><text start="3328.119" dur="3.871">not generally interested in our</text><text start="3329.76" dur="3.94">aesthetic and design ideas they were</text><text start="3331.99" dur="3.359">interested in us keeping clean things</text><text start="3333.7" dur="4.5">that were someone else&apos;s design ideas</text><text start="3335.349" dur="6.061">and so we got conditioned very deeply in</text><text start="3338.2" dur="6.12">that system that is part of the system</text><text start="3341.41" dur="7.5">that is self terminating because most</text><text start="3344.32" dur="7.59">people are working at jobs that are</text><text start="3348.91" dur="6.15">causing more net harm to the world than</text><text start="3351.91" dur="5.64">benefit that they don&apos;t actually feel</text><text start="3355.06" dur="4.74">good about but they do not trust their</text><text start="3357.55" dur="3.9">own feeling or believe that they can do</text><text start="3359.8" dur="3.33">something else or know how to actually</text><text start="3361.45" dur="3.54">figure out what to do or believe in</text><text start="3363.13" dur="5.55">themselves enough to self assess or self</text><text start="3364.99" dur="6.24">initiate and most people when they look</text><text start="3368.68" dur="5.49">at various situations in the world</text><text start="3371.23" dur="5.19">actually feel really not okay with much</text><text start="3374.17" dur="4.11">of the way the world is in ways that</text><text start="3376.42" dur="3.81">come actually from love in them they</text><text start="3378.28" dur="4.86">come from beauty in them even if</text><text start="3380.23" dur="5.04">expressed as anger or jaded Ness but</text><text start="3383.14" dur="5.37">they don&apos;t believe in their own ability</text><text start="3385.27" dur="5.76">to find solutions to figure out so</text><text start="3388.51" dur="4.859">they just numb out name them out on</text><text start="3391.03" dur="5.37">alcohol or on TV or whatever they do and</text><text start="3393.369" dur="5.551">so when you look at the people that have</text><text start="3396.4" dur="3.81">ever meaningfully moved the world</text><text start="3398.92" dur="3.06">forward where they solved some problems</text><text start="3400.21" dur="3.54">that had not been solved it really</text><text start="3401.98" dur="3.48">needed to be solved nobody taught them</text><text start="3403.75" dur="3.69">how to do it because no one cooks the</text><text start="3405.46" dur="3.24">problem wasn&apos;t solved yet nobody could</text><text start="3407.44" dur="3.149">have taught Edison how to make a light</text><text start="3408.7" dur="4.77">bulb nobody could have told Gandhi how</text><text start="3410.589" dur="4.321">to get home roll for India and one of</text><text start="3413.47" dur="4.379">the fascinating things was that they</text><text start="3414.91" dur="4.679">decided to do it because they knew that</text><text start="3417.849" dur="5.941">it was important before having any idea</text><text start="3419.589" dur="6.721">how to do it and then they trusted in</text><text start="3423.79" dur="2.79">both the rightness of it enough and</text><text start="3426.31" dur="3.18">there</text><text start="3426.58" dur="5.22">capability to learn enough to really</text><text start="3429.49" dur="4.47">apply themselves deeply and to continue</text><text start="3431.8" dur="5.7">through all of the early not successes</text><text start="3433.96" dur="6.33">until they found stuff so what I would</text><text start="3437.5" dur="5.04">encourage young people to do is to take</text><text start="3440.29" dur="5.28">profound responsibility for their</text><text start="3442.54" dur="5.19">existence and to know that there are a</text><text start="3445.57" dur="3.69">lot of people in a lot of books and a</text><text start="3447.73" dur="4.89">lot of courses that have valuable should</text><text start="3449.26" dur="4.89">to teach them but if an adequate answer</text><text start="3452.62" dur="2.97">to what they should do with their life</text><text start="3454.15" dur="4.23">existed anywhere that whole thing would</text><text start="3455.59" dur="4.47">be done already and the fact that the</text><text start="3458.38" dur="3.54">things aren&apos;t done means that all the</text><text start="3460.06" dur="3.75">best teachers and thinkers have not got</text><text start="3461.92" dur="3.27">it yet right they have ideas they have</text><text start="3463.81" dur="4.56">things to learn you should absolutely</text><text start="3465.19" dur="5.01">learn from them and you&apos;re going to have</text><text start="3468.37" dur="3.36">something to add not only in terms of</text><text start="3470.2" dur="5.04">your work but also in terms of your</text><text start="3471.73" dur="6.57">creativity so I would say look around at</text><text start="3475.24" dur="8.16">the world and see all of the things that</text><text start="3478.3" dur="6.96">really bother you and realize that them</text><text start="3483.4" dur="4.2">bothering you as part of your guidance</text><text start="3485.26" dur="4.05">and see all the things that you really</text><text start="3487.6" dur="3.42">love all the things that are beautiful</text><text start="3489.31" dur="3.78">and you realize they&apos;re connected right</text><text start="3491.02" dur="4.32">animals are beautiful and then all of</text><text start="3493.09" dur="3.99">the devastation of animals and their</text><text start="3495.34" dur="3.15">habitat is really bothersome people are</text><text start="3497.08" dur="3.48">beautiful so homelessness and or</text><text start="3498.49" dur="4.59">bothersome right you children are</text><text start="3500.56" dur="5.67">beautiful so bad education systems are</text><text start="3503.08" dur="6.09">bothersome so look at what you love look</text><text start="3506.23" dur="6.48">at how what you love is not well</text><text start="3509.17" dur="6.36">supported in various areas and realize</text><text start="3512.71" dur="4.74">that it does not have to be that way any</text><text start="3515.53" dur="5.31">more than the world had to stay dark in</text><text start="3517.45" dur="5.55">the time of Edison and yet for all of</text><text start="3520.84" dur="3.87">human history before Edison it did right</text><text start="3523.0" dur="3.66">and taking on something that seemed</text><text start="3524.71" dur="5.4">impossible literally delivered the world</text><text start="3526.66" dur="6.3">from darkness in that way right and then</text><text start="3530.11" dur="4.8">study the out of the topic right</text><text start="3532.96" dur="3.39">without thinking that a completely</text><text start="3534.91" dur="2.94">adequate solution is there so there&apos;s</text><text start="3536.35" dur="3.09">probably a lot of partially good</text><text start="3537.85" dur="3.06">solutions maybe a technology that is</text><text start="3539.44" dur="3.81">totally good technology but it hasn&apos;t</text><text start="3540.91" dur="4.26">market feasibility hasn&apos;t came about yet</text><text start="3543.25" dur="3.6">or the way to bring the meme out there</text><text start="3545.17" dur="3.93">or parts of the ideas are there but they</text><text start="3546.85" dur="4.59">need synthesized or whatever it is study</text><text start="3549.1" dur="4.2">is a problem well study what an adequate</text><text start="3551.44" dur="3.66">solution would look like gain a real</text><text start="3553.3" dur="4.08">clear inside of what adequate solution</text><text start="3555.1" dur="3.87">looks like in your own area of what you</text><text start="3557.38" dur="5.01">care to contribute to</text><text start="3558.97" dur="4.92">as things emerged that you feel like you</text><text start="3562.39" dur="4.86">can contribute to as you&apos;re learning</text><text start="3563.89" dur="6.9">about it contribute to them and continue</text><text start="3567.25" dur="5.82">to assess on your own and initiate on</text><text start="3570.79" dur="4.74">your own with of course good input from</text><text start="3573.07" dur="4.41">all the places of good input that&apos;s the</text><text start="3575.53" dur="5.04">key thing I would say take really deep</text><text start="3577.48" dur="4.68">responsibility for the impact that you</text><text start="3580.57" dur="3.87">have in your life while you&apos;re here and</text><text start="3582.16" dur="3.69">then all of the study all the training</text><text
