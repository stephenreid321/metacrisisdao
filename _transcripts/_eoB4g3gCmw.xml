yeah I am hoping</text><text start="31.65" dur="4.499">that I think initially when we spoke we</text><text start="34.739" dur="2.91">were thinking of taking this kind of all</text><text start="36.149" dur="4.381">matter and talk about the generator</text><text start="37.649" dur="4.831">function of X was and and and and I&apos;m</text><text start="40.53" dur="4.5">kind of like what are the I guess like</text><text start="42.48" dur="5.52">more abstract and long-term consequences</text><text start="45.03" dur="4.77">from this but I think in the interest of</text><text start="48.0" dur="4.17">time we have decided to kind of like you</text><text start="49.8" dur="3.66">pick us up where we are right now now</text><text start="52.17" dur="3.51">kind of like what are the threads that</text><text start="53.46" dur="4.71">we should be unraveling more and then we</text><text start="55.68" dur="4.109">see kind of like how that affects much</text><text start="58.17" dur="3.54">of the generator functions of extension</text><text start="59.789" dur="3.961">is that you&apos;re so worried about so thank</text><text start="61.71" dur="3.659">you so so much for for coming on

even</text><text start="100.7" dur="2.97">though a number of the people that</text><text start="102.14" dur="5.06">you&apos;ve had on before people I respect</text><text start="103.67" dur="5.97">and our friends and colleagues I</text><text start="107.2" dur="4.36">actually just want to acknowledge first</text><text start="109.64" dur="4.41">what an awesome thing you&apos;re doing here</text><text start="111.56" dur="4.47">I look at the list of people that you&apos;ve</text><text start="114.05" dur="3.15">had on in the last 10 weeks and only 10</text><text start="116.03" dur="2.58">percent of these people are here for the</text><text start="117.2" dur="3.48">first time it&apos;s really kind of an</text><text start="118.61" dur="4.91">incredible online university and a good</text><text start="120.68" dur="5.46">use of this time so that&apos;s really neat</text><text start="123.52" dur="4.959">because I haven&apos;t been in the previous</text><text start="126.14" dur="5.13">ones in the poll said people were</text><text start="128.479" dur="4.741">feeling generally better many of them</text><text start="131.27" dur="4.29">and you were talking about existential</text><text start="133.22" dur="4.53">hope and making opportunities can you</text><text start="135.56" dur="5.82">just kind of clue me in briefly what</text><text start="137.75" dur="5.73">some of the major themes of the kovat</text><text start="141.38" dur="4.73">related make things better opportunities</text><text start="143.48" dur="10.05">are that this group has been following</text><text start="146.11" dur="8.83">yes okay so there&apos;s close out the hive</text><text start="153.53" dur="3.57">mind which is kind of like the</text><text start="154.94" dur="4.109">incredible opportunities that are</text><text start="157.1" dur="4.199">currently popping up for health</text><text start="159.049" dur="4.921">extension right because suddenly the</text><text start="161.299" dur="4.621">whole world is worried about about their</text><text start="163.97" dur="3.989">health and a lot of the current biotech</text><text start="165.92" dur="4.319">sector money there was already kind of</text><text start="167.959" dur="4.771">like available beforehand is really like</text><text start="170.239" dur="10.56">funneled into vaccines that put about</text><text start="172.73" dur="10.47">some of the efforts that&apos;s on the one</text><text start="180.799" dur="4.591">end you know a lot of people out of work</text><text start="183.2" dur="4.08">and that kind of that that may slow</text><text start="185.39" dur="3.689">innovation Donovan on quite</text><text start="187.28" dur="4.769">significantly then I think on the other</text><text start="189.079" dur="5.521">hand what we talked about fuses into the</text><text start="192.049" dur="4.261">promises of the virtual world right we</text><text start="194.6" dur="3.81">have everything from healer medicine in</text><text start="196.31" dur="4.679">India to kind like this you know really</text><text start="198.41" dur="4.799">kind of like flourishing of global</text><text start="200.989" dur="3.84">online universities and such that may</text><text start="203.209" dur="4.59">kind of like actually make it much</text><text start="204.829" dur="4.951">harder for the general monopolies of the</text><text start="207.799" dur="4.56">kind of kind of broken educational</text><text start="209.78" dur="6.09">systems that rely on like you know a lot</text><text start="212.359" dur="5.91">of foreign for foreign student payments</text><text start="215.87" dur="3.869">to survive it may make it much much</text><text start="218.269" dur="4.381">harder for them to provide still have</text><text start="219.739" dur="4.921">this almost like predatory and hinge on</text><text start="222.65" dur="3.75">the system so it was a lot of like what</text><text start="224.66" dur="2.82">I want to use in the virtual space are</text><text start="226.4" dur="3.38">possible right now</text><text start="227.48" dur="5.91">that VR is almost becoming as good as a</text><text start="229.78" dur="5.769">human you can as a brain computer</text><text start="233.39" dur="4.739">interface and then you know we also</text><text start="235.549" dur="4.11">talked about like the different ways of</text><text start="238.129" dur="4.58">in which culture shifting in which</text><text start="239.659" dur="5.16">people are now like me stepping up and</text><text start="242.709" dur="4.121">really fantastic ways in which people</text><text start="244.819" dur="4.711">are times like willing to tap into grey</text><text start="246.83" dur="4.89">zones and legal areas to save lives</text><text start="249.53" dur="3.9">in which people are like stepping up and</text><text start="251.72" dur="3.69">proposing you go defense funds for those</text><text start="253.43" dur="3.69">you know who are in those gray areas and</text><text start="255.41" dur="3.329">saving lives for those people who are</text><text start="257.12" dur="3.299">blowing the whistle and in the sense in</text><text start="258.739" dur="3.811">which vaguely centralized communities</text><text start="260.419" dur="3.87">are coming together and a few</text><text start="262.55" dur="3.78">technologies that may help us do that</text><text start="264.289" dur="5.13">much much better in the future and</text><text start="266.33" dur="5.1">especially from from crypto Commerce and</text><text start="269.419" dur="4.321">but then also how many of those</text><text start="271.43" dur="5.93">technologies are currently being have</text><text start="273.74" dur="7.5">been exploited by more totalitarian</text><text start="277.36" dur="6.82">forms of government and all the ways in</text><text start="281.24" dur="5.67">which like you know it&apos;s a more</text><text start="284.18" dur="4.62">predatory state like seeking the nooks</text><text start="286.91" dur="2.819">and crannies and which to expand their</text><text start="288.8" dur="3.299">power into it</text><text start="289.729" dur="3.81">right and so we are usually economic</text><text start="292.099" dur="4.471">always the risk and opportunities in</text><text start="293.539" dur="4.111">those area and I mean then we last week</text><text start="296.57" dur="3.12">we would focus more on the kind of</text><text start="297.65" dur="4.139">global scale and in the ways in which</text><text start="299.69" dur="3.24">currently you know we have a ton of</text><text start="301.789" dur="2.461">people that are really really good at</text><text start="302.93" dur="2.39">sense making we have a ton of people</text><text start="304.25" dur="3.33">that are really good at modeling</text><text start="305.32" dur="5.409">meticulous FHI they all came out</text><text start="307.58" dur="4.44">fantastic modeling efforts but it&apos;s just</text><text start="310.729" dur="3.12">so happens that no one&apos;s really</text><text start="312.02" dur="4.23">listening we have really good prediction</text><text start="313.849" dur="5.04">tools already people working on them but</text><text start="316.25" dur="5.16">it still kind of feels that they&apos;re not</text><text start="318.889" dur="4.801">really effectively informing action yet</text><text start="321.41" dur="3.96">but you know there are a few ways like</text><text start="323.69" dur="3.87">you know we talked about Dow democracy</text><text start="325.37" dur="3.33">about future keys and so on but but</text><text start="327.56" dur="3.9">they&apos;re just not really entering the</text><text start="328.7" dur="5.16">mainstream discourse so like my main</text><text start="331.46" dur="4.769">fear is that there are actually a lot of</text><text start="333.86" dur="5.67">opportunities available and but a lot of</text><text start="336.229" dur="4.981">those people like I think many of us as</text><text start="339.53" dur="4.109">they&apos;re thinking along those lines are</text><text start="341.21" dur="3.69">just not being insulted so I&apos;m one one</text><text start="343.639" dur="2.671">kind of choice at me because you have</text><text start="344.9" dur="3.57">this in either but there&apos;s kind of a</text><text start="346.31" dur="6.05">parallel operating system and hope that</text><text start="348.47" dur="5.97">we can take over and take over the</text><text start="352.36" dur="5.59">system is taking effect</text><text start="354.44" dur="5.159">or we can try to try to reform but but</text><text start="357.95" dur="3.39">it just doesn&apos;t need to make there as</text><text start="359.599" dur="4.651">much opportunity to bail in right now</text><text start="361.34" dur="4.35">so those are I guess a few things that</text><text start="364.25" dur="2.82">we&apos;ve been talking about I can go on the</text><text start="365.69" dur="3.33">laundry list but then I think I would be</text><text start="367.07" dur="7.08">running the salon I definitely don&apos;t</text><text start="369.02" dur="8.97">want to be doing that I get it we can&apos;t</text><text start="374.15" dur="5.43">meet in person can we meet online and</text><text start="377.99" dur="3.72">are there unique opportunities to being</text><text start="379.58" dur="4.5">able to meet online if healthcare is</text><text start="381.71" dur="4.86"> up can we use it to reform</text><text start="384.08" dur="6.3">healthcare writ large if education gets</text><text start="386.57" dur="5.76">totally disrupted rather than have you</text><text start="390.38" dur="3.599">know just a generation that has major</text><text start="392.33" dur="5.73">gaps in their education can we reform</text><text start="393.979" dur="6.201">education I would like a classic example</text><text start="398.06" dur="6.54">right now is the food supply chain is</text><text start="400.18" dur="5.709">we&apos;ve basically by stopping travel to be</text><text start="404.6" dur="2.91">stopped the movement of the virus we</text><text start="405.889" dur="3.901">also stop the movement of fertilizers</text><text start="407.51" dur="4.26">and pesticides and key supply chain</text><text start="409.79" dur="3.689">dynamics that have led to this massive</text><text start="411.77" dur="4.28">culling of animals and throwing dairy</text><text start="413.479" dur="7.681">away and tilling food back into the soil</text><text start="416.05" dur="7.06">so we have basically excessive supply</text><text start="421.16" dur="3.72">that can&apos;t get where it needs so it&apos;s</text><text start="423.11" dur="3.45">getting ruined while the demand hasn&apos;t</text><text start="424.88" dur="3.69">actually gone down it&apos;s just we can&apos;t</text><text start="426.56" dur="5.25">route it you know properly and the</text><text start="428.57" dur="5.4">perishability and the thin margins are</text><text start="431.81" dur="4.26">such that we&apos;re actually driving hunger</text><text start="433.97" dur="3.66">at scale so the food supply system for</text><text start="436.07" dur="4.17">give or take two billion people just got</text><text start="437.63" dur="5.94"> and so then we&apos;re like okay well</text><text start="440.24" dur="5.22">having a supply chain that has that many</text><text start="443.57" dur="3.779">steps of vulnerability and it isn&apos;t a</text><text start="445.46" dur="6.09">good idea so if we have to fix it right</text><text start="447.349" dur="5.281">now and we do because otherwise tens of</text><text start="451.55" dur="3.6">millions or hundreds of millions of</text><text start="452.63" dur="5.7">people don&apos;t go hungry peacefully right</text><text start="455.15" dur="5.94">so you start to get a movement from a</text><text start="458.33" dur="5.459">virus to broken supply chains to hunger</text><text start="461.09" dur="7.079">to violence to war escalation so let&apos;s</text><text start="463.789" dur="7.38">say we&apos;re looking at the fact that</text><text start="468.169" dur="5.101">Nigeria has the largest food insecurity</text><text start="471.169" dur="3.87">population and population density in the</text><text start="473.27" dur="3.269">world 26 million give or take people</text><text start="475.039" dur="3.481">without food security and that their</text><text start="476.539" dur="4.621">food system just got completely damaged</text><text start="478.52" dur="4.5">and what happened here plus their</text><text start="481.16" dur="3.54">economy because they&apos;re there based on</text><text start="483.02" dur="2.94">the price of oil right like almost their</text><text start="484.7" dur="2.76">entire economy is based on the price of</text><text start="485.96" dur="3.509">oil which just had this massive Saudi</text><text start="487.46" dur="4.59">Arabia Russia oil shock kind of thing</text><text start="489.469" dur="5.341">and you look at what that starts to look</text><text start="492.05" dur="4.83">like in terms of both so</text><text start="494.81" dur="4.89">you know Boko Haram is increasing and</text><text start="496.88" dur="5.34">local gangs are increasing and and then</text><text start="499.7" dur="4.65">insurgency movements so do we start to</text><text start="502.22" dur="2.88">see a massive exit a serious style from</text><text start="504.35" dur="2.73">Nigeria</text><text start="505.1" dur="3.66">well after Syria and the damage that</text><text start="507.08" dur="5.79">happened to the EU where do those people</text><text start="508.76" dur="5.7">go because you doesn&apos;t want to take them</text><text start="512.87" dur="4.62">right and it&apos;s under such massive</text><text start="514.46" dur="5.73">fracture pressures already after brexit</text><text start="517.49" dur="4.169">and after kovat that some places take</text><text start="520.19" dur="3.839">them and others don&apos;t what does that do</text><text start="521.659" dur="4.051">kind of for fracture pressure so so this</text><text start="524.029" dur="3.961">is when you can start to see how like a</text><text start="525.71" dur="4.92">cascade of events like this goes we take</text><text start="527.99" dur="4.83">the damage to the food supply that&apos;s</text><text start="530.63" dur="4.32">happened in India India and Bangladesh</text><text start="532.82" dur="4.68">are particularly interesting because of</text><text start="534.95" dur="5.46">the population density multiplied by</text><text start="537.5" dur="5.91">total population that is near food</text><text start="540.41" dur="5.22">vulnerabilities and so you start to get</text><text start="543.41" dur="3.6">a damage to the food supply system they</text><text start="545.63" dur="4.53">are and the total number of people that</text><text start="547.01" dur="5.94">can be affected is just unprecedented is</text><text start="550.16" dur="6.48">astronomical and we were looking at this</text><text start="552.95" dur="5.67">before Co vid from climate change so</text><text start="556.64" dur="7.41">remember the year started off with</text><text start="558.62" dur="6.84">Australia burning right and Wow there</text><text start="564.05" dur="3.0">were a number of factors there was an</text><text start="565.46" dur="4.68">environmental mismanagement that led to</text><text start="567.05" dur="6.48">too much downed wood because they had</text><text start="570.14" dur="4.46">prevented small fires and not dealt with</text><text start="573.53" dur="4.309">the forestry well and because</text><text start="574.6" dur="4.87">groundwater had been used up</text><text start="577.839" dur="4.031">irresponsibly in whatever there were a</text><text start="579.47" dur="4.47">number of factors but increased dryness</text><text start="581.87" dur="3.03">and heat was one of the major factors so</text><text start="583.94" dur="4.2">then we started looking at climate</text><text start="584.9" dur="5.55">change mediated not just do we have a</text><text start="588.14" dur="3.72">climate that takes out the ability for</text><text start="590.45" dur="2.97">people to live as a whole which we&apos;re</text><text start="591.86" dur="2.97">not going to get which is why Caesar and</text><text start="593.42" dur="3.3">FHI whatever don&apos;t look at climate</text><text start="594.83" dur="4.65">change that much but they should when</text><text start="596.72" dur="5.19">they factor cascade effects which is do</text><text start="599.48" dur="5.609">you have a climate dynamic that leads to</text><text start="601.91" dur="4.98">like for instance this upcoming summer</text><text start="605.089" dur="3.931">in India and Bangladesh are estimated to</text><text start="606.89" dur="4.05">have 52 Celsius heat waves independent</text><text start="609.02" dur="3.95">of kovat well that is enough to actually</text><text start="610.94" dur="4.53">destroy most of their staple crops and</text><text start="612.97" dur="4.93">so when you don&apos;t have food stores</text><text start="615.47" dur="3.869">singing meaningful enough food stores</text><text start="617.9" dur="2.7">you can destroy the staple crops and you</text><text start="619.339" dur="4.261">have people that are right on the edge</text><text start="620.6" dur="6.72">of basic needs being unmet then what</text><text start="623.6" dur="5.04">happened so then do the people in like</text><text start="627.32" dur="3.51">without groundwater</text><text start="628.64" dur="5.28">and without food and 52 Celsius heat</text><text start="630.83" dur="4.94">just die peacefully right or do they</text><text start="633.92" dur="4.38">start to try to get access to the</text><text start="635.77" dur="4.66">limited resources and then violence</text><text start="638.3"

tension</text><text start="643.88" dur="6.6">lines so does that look like Hindu</text><text start="647.45" dur="4.68">Muslim tension lines sure and so then</text><text start="650.48" dur="4.17">does that look like India Pakistan</text><text start="652.13" dur="4.59">tension it starts to mount and you start</text><text start="654.65" dur="6.93">to see the Cascade that happens when you</text><text start="656.72" dur="6.72">have systemic fragility of this kind so</text><text start="661.58" dur="3.36">now we still have that upcoming set of</text><text start="663.44" dur="2.79">heat waves to deal with in India on top</text><text start="664.94" dur="4.16">of the fact that we already just had a</text><text start="666.23" dur="4.77">unanticipated crop failure ahead of that</text><text start="669.1" dur="5.5">okay so now we&apos;re talking about how do</text><text start="671.0" dur="6.21">we rebuild things does anybody want to</text><text start="674.6" dur="4.74">rebuild this food supply system the way</text><text start="677.21" dur="3.48">that it is like no it&apos;s the most</text><text start="679.34" dur="4.11">terrible thing you can imagine right</text><text start="680.69" dur="4.35">because if you&apos;re gonna do factory</text><text start="683.45" dur="3.39">farming nobody wants that near them</text><text start="685.04" dur="3.3">because it&apos;s gruesome right it&apos;s</text><text start="686.84" dur="3.18">environmentally gruesome it&apos;s ethically</text><text start="688.34" dur="4.41">gruesome it&apos;s like nobody wants those</text><text start="690.02" dur="5.4">jobs they have to usually be the jobs or</text><text start="692.75" dur="6.57">largely run by immigrants who have no</text><text start="695.42" dur="6.0">other option and so if you&apos;re gonna do</text><text start="699.32" dur="4.08">gruesome factory farms and they have to</text><text start="701.42" dur="3.45">be in the areas that will accept them</text><text start="703.4" dur="2.91">then you have to ship them to far</text><text start="704.87" dur="3.09">distances then you also have to have a</text><text start="706.31" dur="3.96">very fragile supply chain that can break</text><text start="707.96" dur="5.13">from something like COBIT so let&apos;s say</text><text start="710.27" dur="4.56">we want to make our supply chains less</text><text start="713.09" dur="3.06">fragile that also means we want to</text><text start="714.83" dur="3.63">increase locality if you want to</text><text start="716.15" dur="4.17">increase locality you have to have types</text><text start="718.46" dur="3.9">of Agriculture that people are okay</text><text start="720.32" dur="4.59">seeing which is actually really good</text><text start="722.36" dur="4.56">right because the ability to ship the</text><text start="724.91" dur="4.02">horror somewhere else right the open-pit</text><text start="726.92" dur="3.51">mining or the mountaintop removal mining</text><text start="728.93" dur="2.94">or the factory farm or the landfill that</text><text start="730.43" dur="3.06">we can ship the horse somewhere else but</text><text start="731.87" dur="3.18">nobody has to see it depend on lots of</text><text start="733.49" dur="3.27">shipping and everybody thinks that life</text><text start="735.05" dur="3.12">is pretty cool around here because we</text><text start="736.76" dur="3.63">put all the ugly parts somewhere else</text><text start="738.17" dur="4.59">that is actually one of the things that</text><text start="740.39" dur="3.87">drives systemic fragility so if we start</text><text start="742.76" dur="3.33">saying well how do we increase food</text><text start="744.26" dur="5.82">security well one aspect is can we start</text><text start="746.09" dur="5.79">increasing locality in food systems well</text><text start="750.08" dur="4.08">doing that will also require making food</text><text start="751.88" dur="3.87">systems that are better for soil better</text><text start="754.16" dur="3.54">for animal welfare better for the</text><text start="755.75" dur="3.37">environment better for human health on</text><text start="757.7" dur="5.7">and on right</text><text start="759.12" dur="7.23">so and better for preventing future</text><text start="763.4" dur="4.78">zoonotic pandemics that occur in places</text><text start="766.35" dur="5.58">where you have a bunch of sick animals</text><text start="768.18" dur="7.94">in a tight environment so it&apos;s important</text><text start="771.93" dur="7.2">to remember that right before China had</text><text start="776.12" dur="5.8">you know SARS co2 emerged they had to</text><text start="779.13" dur="5.07">kill a humungous percentage of all their</text><text start="781.92" dur="4.74">pigs because of a swine flu that emerged</text><text start="784.2" dur="5.27">because of terrible pork bass factory</text><text start="786.66" dur="5.429">farming and and they had another major</text><text start="789.47" dur="3.97">bird flu outbreak India had a bird flu</text><text start="792.089" dur="2.671">outbreak because factory farms are</text><text start="793.44" dur="4.53">terrible and they shouldn&apos;t exist so</text><text start="794.76" dur="7.62">that&apos;s an example of something that just</text><text start="797.97" dur="6.39">broke that we have to rebuild because</text><text start="802.38" dur="4.02">the consequence of not rebuilding it is</text><text start="804.36" dur="5.46">too destructive for the world and we</text><text start="806.4" dur="5.01">need to rebuild it differently there&apos;s a</text><text start="809.82" dur="4.74">bunch of other examples like this so</text><text start="811.41" dur="7.29">pretty much the way I see kovat is that</text><text start="814.56" dur="6.9">it was just a large enough global issue</text><text start="818.7" dur="4.32">to set off the cascade effects of</text><text start="821.46" dur="6.06">systemic fragilities that would have</text><text start="823.02" dur="7.37">been set off by something and so now the</text><text start="827.52" dur="6.84">major issues that we&apos;re looking at are</text><text start="830.39" dur="5.29">we you know like let&apos;s say we look at so</text><text start="834.36" dur="3.66">we just talk about food supply let&apos;s say</text><text start="835.68" dur="5.099">we look at the economy well we already</text><text start="838.02" dur="4.98">had a situation with a percentage of</text><text start="840.779" dur="3.781">global GDP that went to debt servicing</text><text start="843.0" dur="3.779">was so high that the economy was</text><text start="844.56" dur="4.29">fundamentally dead and broken right and</text><text start="846.779" dur="3.511">we needed to restructure it in some deep</text><text start="848.85" dur="4.62">way because you can&apos;t have that much of</text><text start="850.29" dur="5.489">total GDP going to debt servicing well</text><text start="853.47" dur="4.77">as a result of kovat GDP dropped</text><text start="855.779" dur="4.591">everywhere and that went way the up</text><text start="858.24" dur="5.13">and we were already at an existential</text><text start="860.37" dur="6.089">level of GDP to debt ratio so it&apos;s like</text><text start="863.37" dur="5.13">okay so what what are the economic</text><text start="866.459" dur="5.011">effects of trying to keep propping that</text><text start="868.5" dur="4.89">system up and if you play them out</text><text start="871.47" dur="4.41">they&apos;re terrible what does it take to</text><text start="873.39" dur="4.47">fix it can we actually redo global</text><text start="875.88" dur="4.62">financial monetary policy central</text><text start="877.86" dur="4.55">banking policy what is the biggest type</text><text start="880.5" dur="4.91">of step we could actually make in this</text><text start="882.41" dur="3.0">place</text><text start="888.41" dur="5.34">I think it&apos;s important to note you know</text><text start="892.069" dur="5.21">you were mentioning something that might</text><text start="893.75" dur="6.66">be able to decrease predatory</text><text start="897.279" dur="6.131">opportunism in in certain places like we</text><text start="900.41" dur="4.109">were at education I would say since Cove</text><text start="903.41" dur="3.09">it has been happening predatory</text><text start="904.519" dur="3.75">opportunism has increased more than I</text><text start="906.5" dur="5.899">have ever seen it in any other time or</text><text start="908.269" dur="6.661">that I can think of in history because</text><text start="912.399" dur="4.18">when the market gets more volatile</text><text start="914.93" dur="2.94">there&apos;s a lot more money to be made if</text><text start="916.579" dur="2.671">you know how to make it there&apos;s a lot</text><text start="917.87" dur="2.339">more money to be lost there&apos;s also a lot</text><text start="919.25" dur="2.459">more money to be made because there&apos;s</text><text start="920.209" dur="3.211">more movement occurring so if you&apos;re the</text><text start="921.709" dur="3.721">one that is at the top of the power-law</text><text start="923.42" dur="5.339">distribution of intelligence and ability</text><text start="925.43" dur="4.98">to actuate then you&apos;re going to do very</text><text start="928.759" dur="3.18">well and we saw that right we saw some</text><text start="930.41" dur="3.479">people get stupidly rich during the</text><text start="931.939" dur="4.051">Great Depression relative to everyone</text><text start="933.889" dur="3.3">else and also get more total asymmetry</text><text start="935.99" dur="3.18">of wealth as if most people were getting</text><text start="937.189" dur="7.981">poorer so it&apos;s a the volatility</text><text start="939.17" dur="6.959">increases asymmetries so when you look</text><text start="945.17" dur="3.029">at all the private intelligence</text><text start="946.129" dur="3.45">companies that when people leave CIA and</text><text start="948.199" dur="4.13">NSA and whatever that&apos;s where they go to</text><text start="949.579" dur="4.851">work with those capabilities who</text><text start="952.329" dur="4.271">contracts them who are their main</text><text start="954.43" dur="3.55">customers well it&apos;s financial</text><text start="956.6" dur="2.789">institutions are the biggest customer</text><text start="957.98" dur="3.51">there&apos;s plenty of other ones right but</text><text start="959.389" dur="6.921">hedge funds and private equity funds</text><text start="961.49" dur="8.31">whatever so in terms of who was getting</text><text start="966.31" dur="5.41">briefings in December and then early</text><text start="969.8" dur="3.75">January this is why you saw senators</text><text start="971.72" dur="3.21">selling stock in January regarding oh</text><text start="973.55" dur="6.089">this is actually a big deal and</text><text start="974.93" dur="7.56">this is going to affect the world if I</text><text start="979.639" dur="4.56">run a hedge fund and the market is near</text><text start="982.49" dur="3.329">the top of what the market has ever been</text><text start="984.199" dur="5.101">at and can&apos;t keep going like that</text><text start="985.819" dur="6.031">forever and I see that there&apos;s about to</text><text start="989.3" dur="4.32">be a major set of hits even if I</text><text start="991.85" dur="3.239">hypothetically have a lot of money and a</text><text start="993.62" dur="3.63">lot of power and a lot of access and I</text><text start="995.089" dur="3.69">could try to use that to get the c-d-c</text><text start="997.25" dur="2.819">in the w-h-o to do the right

start="1003.79" dur="3.33">incentive is to say this is the</text><text start="1005.41" dur="4.14">time to sell all my stocks at the top of</text><text start="1007.12" dur="3.899">the market I&apos;m gonna get a rebuy them at</text><text start="1009.55" dur="3.18">the bottom of the market when they are</text><text start="1011.019" dur="3.63">radically decreased in price and</text><text

entire way down I&apos;m gonna</text><text start="1018.25" dur="3.24">start shorting Airlines and whatever</text><text start="1019.779" dur="3.361">else it is and because of</text><text start="1021.49" dur="4.349">asymmetric information asymmetric</text><text start="1023.14" dur="4.799">intelligence I&apos;m gonna know about oil</text><text start="1025.839" dur="3.421">shock issues and food chalk issues and</text><text start="1027.939" dur="3.091">whatever to be able to know which</text><text start="1029.26" dur="5.1">commodities to short and which ones to</text><text start="1031.03" dur="5.039">put options on ahead of time then there</text><text start="1034.36" dur="3.24">were a lot of pools of capital like</text><text start="1036.069" dur="3.451">sovereign wealth funds and family</text><text start="1037.6" dur="4.28">offices that big pools of liquid capital</text><text start="1039.52" dur="5.76">that could not be well deployed recently</text><text start="1041.88" dur="6.429">because we had negative interest rates</text><text start="1045.28" dur="4.23">on bonds and so it&apos;s like I can&apos;t just</text><text start="1048.309" dur="2.731">leave my money sitting somewhere and</text><text start="1049.51" dur="3.21">have it make money and negative interest</text><text start="1051.04" dur="3.93">rates are because the market was so</text><text start="1052.72" dur="3.959">broken because so much of the money was</text><text start="1054.97" dur="3.48">going to debt servicing and the global</text><text start="1056.679" dur="3.721">wealth inequality was so much that you</text><text start="1058.45" dur="3.45">had to basically just keep pumping free</text><text start="1060.4" dur="3.65">money which is what negative interest is</text><text start="1061.9" dur="5.67">to keep the system from collapsing and</text><text start="1064.05" dur="5.68">so and you didn&apos;t have very high</text><text start="1067.57" dur="5.01">volatility so now those huge pools of</text><text start="1069.73" dur="4.56">sovereign wealth and you know liquid</text><text start="1072.58" dur="3.87">capital are like awesome we get a buy up</text><text start="1074.29" dur="7.26">infrastructure for pennies on the dime</text><text start="1076.45" dur="7.92">right and consolidate power law so the</text><text start="1081.55" dur="5.759">people who have most access to</text><text start="1084.37" dur="4.74">intelligence and actuation capacity have</text><text start="1087.309" dur="4.681">been busier than ever during this time</text><text start="1089.11" dur="4.62">not relaxing right if you&apos;re if you have</text><text start="1091.99" dur="3.72">less to do you know that you are not at</text><text start="1093.73" dur="5.76">the power law distribution at the top of</text><text start="1095.71" dur="6.06">the power law distribution because those</text><text start="1099.49" dur="4.319">people are seeing this as a maximum</text><text start="1101.77" dur="4.86">opportunity space but it&apos;s the</text><text start="1103.809" dur="5.011">opportunity to be able to say oh you</text><text start="1106.63" dur="6.53">know lots of volatility and it&apos;s not</text><text start="1108.82" dur="8.04">just volatility in markets it&apos;s also</text><text start="1113.16" dur="5.08">awesome this is a great way

that&apos;s and now</text><text start="1124.66" dur="9.899">people will go for it right or we can at</text><text start="1127.36" dur="10.29">least force it through or situations</text><text

dur="4.831">hospitals while also having a real</text><text start="1282.01" dur="4.71">pandemic but there&apos;s some sophistication</text><text start="1285.1" dur="3.169">and nuance to be able to make

start="1289.95" dur="2.789">right so then I&apos;m like oh they&apos;re</text><text start="1291.57" dur="3.12">trying to take our freedoms away we</text><text start="1292.739" dur="3.69">founded this country based on the right</text><text start="1294.69" dur="3.029">to bear arms and you know stand up</text><text start="1296.429" dur="5.521">against our government so that thing</text><text start="1297.719" dur="7.83">starts to happen right and and then you</text><text start="1301.95" dur="6.449">see simultaneous to that black guy</text><text start="1305.549" dur="5.88">running gets shot protests happens a</text><text start="1308.399" dur="4.74">bunch of bunch of black people doing a</text><text start="1311.429" dur="3.45">protest carrying guns right and so you</text><text start="1313.139" dur="3.57">see the like oh there&apos;s lots of sides</text><text start="1314.879" dur="4.14">that are at meaningful tension with each</text><text start="1316.709" dur="5.37">other increasing the signaling of</text><text start="1319.019" dur="5.97">violence then we see the actual violence</text><text start="1322.079" dur="4.5">increasing in in certain areas riots</text><text start="1324.989" dur="3.36">that happened in London and whatever and</text><text start="1326.579" dur="5.88">then very meaningful stuff in places</text><text start="1328.349" dur="8.25">like Nigeria and then we see bigger</text><text start="1332.459" dur="5.82">things like I don&apos;t think most people</text><text start="1336.599" dur="5.52">pay enough attention but when you look</text><text start="1338.279" dur="5.52">at general McChrystal coming out a few</text><text start="1342.119" dur="3.96">weeks ago saying I&apos;m gonna be using</text><text start="1343.799" dur="4.401">advanced

start="1373.409" dur="3.09">signals are closer right so you just</text><text start="1375.179" dur="2.55">start looking at all those types of</text><text start="1376.499" dur="2.85">things and you look at the increased</text><text start="1377.729" dur="5.28">attention and signaling regarding</text><text start="1379.349" dur="7.62">militarism between US and China and on</text><text start="1383.009" dur="5.191">and on so we could go by sector whether</text><text start="1386.969" dur="3.21">we talk about the financial sector the</text><text start="1388.2" dur="5.399">economic sector movements towards</text><text start="1390.179" dur="6.42">violence grid security and say the</text><text start="1393.599" dur="5.94">existing risks that were there just got</text><text start="1396.599" dur="8.58">accelerated by like a decade in almost</text><text start="1399.539" dur="8.31">all areas I mean now the question is to</text><text start="1405.179" dur="5.25">come out the other side not way way WAY</text><text start="1407.849" dur="3.96">worse requires dealing with all that not</text><text start="1410.429" dur="2.67">just dealing with the virus but dealing</text><text start="1411.809" dur="3.42">with the second and third order effects</text><text start="1413.099" dur="3.54">that have already kicked off and if we</text><text start="1415.229" dur="4.14">don&apos;t deal with that we will come out</text><text start="1416.639" dur="4.44">way way worse in order to deal with it</text><text start="1419.369" dur="2.311">we have to do deep enough changes that</text><text start="1421.079" dur="2.131">we will</text><text start="1421.68" dur="3.84">say hey we don&apos;t want to redo food</text><text start="1423.21" dur="3.84">supply this way or monetary policy this</text><text start="1425.52" dur="3.48">way and we could come out much better</text><text start="1427.05" dur="3.12">but that requires that the people who</text><text start="1429.0" dur="3.54">are thinking about how to do it better</text><text start="1430.17" dur="5.04">have to be as effective at making</text><text start="1432.54" dur="3.66">happen at a global scale as the groups</text><text start="1435.21" dur="3.77">that are currently working on power</text><text start="1436.2" dur="2.78">consolidation</text><text start="1440.28" dur="6.61">yeah I think yeah man there are so many</text><text start="1444.7" dur="4.89">things like I mean one of the things</text><text start="1446.89" dur="5.28">just like you know I think echoing would</text><text start="1449.59" dur="4.65">like living off a few of the things that</text><text start="1452.17" dur="3.69">that you mentioned one of the things was</text><text start="1454.24" dur="3.3">like being the Belton vote initiative</text><text start="1455.86" dur="3.33">right like I think in a previous podcast</text><text start="1457.54" dur="3.57">somebody mentioned what what if China</text><text start="1459.19" dur="8.34">was actually tying that you know kind of</text><text start="1461.11" dur="8.13">like to the you know to the to the</text><text start="1467.53" dur="3.6">condition of using their digital</text><text start="1469.24" dur="3.69">currency right then like many of the</text><text start="1471.13" dur="3.72">kind of like digital currencies and like</text><text start="1472.93" dur="3.99">of the promises of freedom that were</text><text start="1474.85" dur="4.23">excited about of them previously would</text><text start="1476.92" dur="4.11">kind of like fall to the wayside then</text><text start="1479.08" dur="4.02">right and I think the same is true when</text><text start="1481.03" dur="4.92">when you look at like I mean if I look</text><text start="1483.1" dur="5.43">on if I think back of how this all</text><text start="1485.95" dur="4.32">started and how can I try optimistic I</text><text start="1488.53" dur="4.41">was that there&apos;s a ton of opportunities</text><text start="1490.27" dur="4.56">to do an incredible amount of good and</text><text start="1492.94" dur="3.57">we&apos;ve been thinking about this and I</text><text start="1494.83" dur="3.03">think really really smart people are on</text><text start="1496.51" dur="3.78">it and I think about it and I talking</text><text start="1497.86" dur="3.99">about it but meanwhile like if I</text><text start="1500.29" dur="3.51">actually look at what&apos;s happening in the</text><text start="1501.85" dur="4.38">world in the meantime it seems like</text><text start="1503.8" dur="4.26">things are just slowly getting worse and</text><text start="1506.23" dur="3.42">worse a little bit like on a very kind</text><text start="1508.06" dur="3.6">of like in a personal level like I was</text><text start="1509.65" dur="4.86">out in San Francisco a few days ago and</text><text start="1511.66" dur="4.26">like they were like Street conic car</text><text start="1514.51" dur="3.54">races on the street right like people</text><text start="1515.92" dur="4.23">with motorcycles with cars racing out</text><text start="1518.05" dur="2.58">like multiple people&apos;s like peeing in</text><text start="1520.15" dur="3.09">the park</text><text start="1520.63" dur="4.59">he&apos;s totally overwhelmed like police</text><text start="1523.24" dur="4.53">every every 5 meters wherever I went</text><text start="1525.22" dur="4.23">like people just like totally wasted</text><text start="1527.77" dur="3.63">everywhere on the street and I was like</text><text start="1529.45" dur="3.12">wow this is very different to like the</text><text start="1531.4" dur="3.72">types of worlds that we&apos;re thinking</text><text start="1532.57" dur="4.86">about on a daily basis and those global</text><text start="1535.12" dur="3.63">sell-off so you know it&apos;s kind of like</text><text start="1537.43" dur="3.87">weird to see that Delta between</text><text start="1538.75" dur="5.43">meanwhile like it&apos;s kind of painful to</text><text start="1541.3" dur="4.98">see like we are always thinking and in</text><text start="1544.18" dur="3.21">in ways in which the system could be</text><text start="1546.28" dur="2.58">much better but like it</text><text start="1547.39" dur="3.24">adjustment like we&apos;re not taking into</text><text start="1548.86" dur="4.86">account many of the kind of like just</text><text start="1550.63" dur="5.91">very real physical kind of like physical</text><text start="1553.72" dur="4.95">constraints that are like that are kind</text><text start="1556.54" dur="4.2">of corny and making people move right</text><text start="1558.67" dur="3.69">and I feel like the same is true like on</text><text start="1560.74" dur="3.81">you know if we think about it on a</text><text start="1562.36" dur="3.69">global scale in terms of and what what</text><text start="1564.55" dur="2.79">may not happen with oil like one of the</text><text start="1566.05" dur="3.84">things that we&apos;ve been talking about is</text><text start="1567.34" dur="4.02">that on the one and it&apos;s it&apos;s somewhat</text><text start="1569.89" dur="3.42">grade that all futures are negative</text><text start="1571.36" dur="2.16">because for ones we may be able to make</text><text start="1573.31" dur="2.49">them</text><text start="1573.52" dur="3.81">move to like we knew and energy but on</text><text start="1575.8" dur="4.41">the other hand also totally</text><text start="1577.33" dur="5.88">terrifying right because that may mean</text><text start="1580.21" dur="4.59">like much much more likely that we enter</text><text start="1583.21" dur="3.18">into like final conflict between</text><text start="1584.8" dur="3.81">different powers and especially with the</text><text start="1586.39" dur="5.13">US couldn t realize it doesn&apos;t have a</text><text start="1588.61" dur="4.05">chip in order on a global scale right</text><text start="1591.52" dur="5.52">like we&apos;ve never seen connect like</text><text start="1592.66" dur="6.54">nations convict in international water</text><text start="1597.04" dur="4.2">moving peacefully or like switching</text><text start="1599.2" dur="3.96">peacefully right so it&apos;s like it&apos;s just</text><text start="1601.24" dur="4.44">seems like it&apos;s a total weird cognitive</text><text start="1603.16" dur="4.65">dissonance by which you can dream up was</text><text start="1605.68" dur="4.05">really amazing changes that could be</text><text start="1607.81" dur="3.54">occurring meanwhile things are moving</text><text start="1609.73" dur="4.08">really quickly in all sorts of</text><text start="1611.35" dur="4.56">directions and in really complicated</text><text start="1613.81" dur="3.24">ways with not only second-order effects</text><text start="1615.91" dur="2.82">but like that&apos;s why I mentioned the</text><text start="1617.05" dur="4.38">currency like the you know potentially</text><text start="1618.73" dur="3.93">Chinese kind of like maybe are ordering</text><text start="1621.43" dur="2.97">something like you know that digital</text><text start="1622.66" dur="3.06">currency if they ever kind of like</text><text start="1624.4" dur="3.33">enforcing they like the development both</text><text start="1625.72" dur="3.18">on many others that&apos;s on the second</text><text start="1627.73" dur="3.6">order that&apos;s almost like a third order</text><text start="1628.9" dur="4.8">effect so I my question so it&apos;s a</text><text start="1631.33" dur="3.9">long-winded way of saying there&apos;s it</text><text start="1633.7" dur="3.42">seems to be a ton of opportunity this</text><text start="1635.23" dur="3.12">needs to be a ton of risk it seems like</text><text start="1637.12" dur="3.96">we have really smart people together</text><text start="1638.35" dur="4.44">often and I&apos;m also speaking about your</text><text start="1641.08" dur="3.53">circles they&apos;re thinking really well</text><text start="1642.79" dur="4.17">about this and you just mentioned how</text><text start="1644.61" dur="4.99">intelligent people within the system are</text><text start="1646.96" dur="3.72">gaining could make a ton of money by</text><text start="1649.6" dur="3.72">gaming the system with the information</text><text start="1650.68" dur="4.2">that they have so what is kind of like</text><text start="1653.32" dur="4.11">the kinds of information that we could</text><text start="1654.88" dur="4.08">be using and the kinds of kind of a</text><text start="1657.43" dur="4.95">comparative advantage that we may have</text><text start="1658.96" dur="4.86">in putting that to the table to create a</text><text start="1662.38" dur="3.62">better world or not the worst ones of</text><text start="1663.82" dur="2.18">those</text><text start="1667.85" dur="6.76">something I was personally really</text><text start="1669.75" dur="7.7">impressed with and I don&apos;t mean in a</text><text start="1674.61" dur="7.08">good way just impressed upon me when I</text><text start="1677.45" dur="7.69">first started encountering the halls of</text><text start="1681.69" dur="5.91">power in the world more so top of</text><text start="1685.14" dur="4.7">government and the finance and like that</text><text start="1687.6" dur="2.24">is</text><text start="1690.11" dur="8.85">how few people there were actually</text><text start="1692.779" dur="8.161">really good thinkers they were smart</text><text start="1698.96" dur="4.439">enough to understand how to execute</text><text start="1700.94" dur="4.68">certain types of things not particularly</text><text start="1703.399" dur="5.221">creative not particularly systemic not</text><text start="1705.62" dur="5.76">particularly critical but like just</text><text start="1708.62" dur="5.22">basically smart enough they were mostly</text><text start="1711.38" dur="7.47">ambitious like super ambitious</text><text start="1713.84" dur="8.719">and super hard-working and slanted</text><text start="1718.85" dur="7.65">heavily in the cluster B Direction</text><text start="1722.559" dur="5.71">cluster B meaning dsm-5 personality</text><text start="1726.5" dur="4.74">disorder specifically the power seeking</text><text start="1728.269" dur="4.77">ones that are willing because like if</text><text start="1731.24" dur="3.539">you don&apos;t have something psychologically</text><text start="1733.039" dur="4.651">wrong with you for the most part those</text><text start="1734.779" dur="5.01">are really miserable lives to be</text><text start="1737.69" dur="3.51">continuously engaging with people that</text><text start="1739.789" dur="2.911">are trying to you over and stab you</text><text start="1741.2" dur="2.849">in the back and lied to you so that you</text><text start="1742.7" dur="2.67">can just get more power that doesn&apos;t</text><text start="1744.049" dur="3.72">equate to a meaningful quality of life</text><text start="1745.37" dur="3.659">and have no real relationships because</text><text start="1747.769" dur="2.91">the only people that are interacting</text><text start="1749.029" dur="3.721">with you want something from you like</text><text start="1750.679" dur="3.75">you there has to be something mostly</text><text start="1752.75" dur="2.97">psychologically wrong with you to want</text><text start="1754.429" dur="3.031">to gain a lot of power so the</text><text start="1755.72" dur="4.85">psychological dispositions that are</text><text start="1757.46" dur="7.079">power seeking you call it sociopathy</text><text start="1760.57" dur="5.92">psychopathy narcissism tend to be</text><text start="1764.539" dur="4.341">willing to put up with the difficulties</text><text start="1766.49" dur="4.98">and do the up things necessary to</text><text start="1768.88" dur="5.019">win a lot of win-lose games and get to</text><text start="1771.47" dur="5.059">the top of the power law distribution of</text><text start="1773.899" dur="2.63">power systems</text><text start="1777.52" dur="3.96">and sometimes you actually need to not</text><text start="1779.56" dur="3.57">have complex thoughts so that you can</text><text start="1781.48" dur="3.21">avoid looking at the externalities</text><text start="1783.13" dur="4.52">you&apos;re causing and that you can give</text><text start="1784.69" dur="7.17">plausible deniability even to yourself</text><text start="1787.65" dur="5.62">and to be able to just execute on some</text><text start="1791.86" dur="3.69">simple things which is usually where</text><text start="1793.27" dur="4.68">more power comes from so then I see</text><text start="1795.55" dur="6.27">people who care more and have more</text><text start="1797.95" dur="5.16">complex thinking not want to do things</text><text start="1801.82" dur="3.54">that will cause lots of externalities</text><text start="1803.11" dur="3.54">and think about what the quality of life</text><text start="1805.36" dur="3.51">in their short period of time being</text><text start="1806.65" dur="4.17">alive is and not necessarily want to be</text><text start="1808.87" dur="3.63">engaged in those types of financial</text><text start="1810.82" dur="4.11">warfare and political warfare whatever</text><text start="1812.5" dur="4.02">all the time and so they just don&apos;t ever</text><text start="1814.93" dur="3.24">get much power which also means they</text><text start="1816.52" dur="5.01">don&apos;t influence things very much so</text><text start="1818.17" dur="6.59">basically there is a disposition there</text><text start="1821.53" dur="6.12">is a systemic disposition that makes</text><text start="1824.76" dur="7.39">sociopaths and they&apos;re like mostly run</text><text start="1827.65" dur="8.79">the world and until we actually fix that</text><text start="1832.15" dur="9.6">we are just on a movement towards self</text><text start="1836.44" dur="7.17">induced determination I mean like you</text><text start="1841.75" dur="3.63">know why the worst rise to the top and</text><text start="1843.61" dur="3.45">and and all of like all of those</text><text start="1845.38" dur="3.27">arguments that I think I usually really</text><text start="1847.06" dur="4.11">you know arguments against the</text><text start="1848.65" dur="4.95">consolidation of power Lloyd and I think</text><text start="1851.17" dur="3.69">that you&apos;ve in previous podcast and I</text><text start="1853.6" dur="3.54">mean you&apos;re writing on it a lot of</text><text start="1854.86" dur="4.47">connect systems that are not currently</text><text start="1857.14" dur="4.02">being built and the crypto commerce base</text><text start="1859.33" dur="3.63">in which at least you could have better</text><text start="1861.16" dur="3.69">sense making tools that and I would make</text><text start="1862.96" dur="4.44">it would make those kind of tendencies</text><text start="1864.85" dur="5.6">much harder but you know I wonder</text><text start="1867.4" dur="6.06">whether you know you&apos;re proposing that</text><text start="1870.45" dur="5.61">like should we reform or should we exit</text><text start="1873.46" dur="2.6">and build new</text><text

start="2990.539" dur="4.141">where that happens I&apos;m like it&apos;s pretty</text><text start="2991.92" dur="5.22">much everything because we we defined</text><text start="2994.68" dur="4.849">the

start="3002.299" dur="4.71">areas so I started looking at more and</text><text start="3005.749" dur="2.61">more of the problems how they</text><text start="3007.009" dur="3.3">interconnected and then are their</text><text start="3008.359" dur="5.01">underlying generators that give rise to</text><text start="3010.309" dur="4.141">them and then also how are they are</text><text start="3013.369" dur="2.611">there things that are getting worse</text><text start="3014.45" dur="3.089">which got me in the catastrophic and</text><text start="3015.98" dur="3.0">existential risk and then I&apos;m

one that you posted yeah that</text><text start="3326.01" dur="8.28">looked quite good I&apos;m gonna need you now</text><text start="3329.69" dur="7.39">all right so first of all I&apos;m a big fan</text><text start="3334.29" dur="6.14">of all the stuff I&apos;ve been amazed by</text><text start="3337.08" dur="6.69">your videos and thoughts and so on the</text><text start="3340.43" dur="5.08">second my question is historically the</text><text start="3343.77" dur="4.11">entities that gained civilization like</text><text start="3345.51" dur="3.21">and became super organisms their</text><text start="3347.88" dur="2.76">religions</text><text start="3348.72" dur="4.46">and I&apos;m curious if you have any ideas of</text><text start="3350.64" dur="5.76">how to create anti rivals or game be ich</text><text start="3353.18" dur="5.23">religion like structures and what</text><text start="3356.4" dur="4.47">advantages and disadvantages there are</text><text start="3358.41" dur="5.04">in kind of co-opting or hijacking the</text><text start="3360.87" dur="5.28">religious aspect of the brain in order</text><text start="3363.45" dur="10.91">to you know steer a burgeoning</text><text start="3366.15" dur="8.21">civilization in that way yeah it&apos;s</text><text start="3376.25" dur="7.21">actually really worth studying the</text><text start="3379.83" dur="6.71">religions that had in some meaningful</text><text start="3383.46" dur="3.08">endurance and</text><text start="3388.45" dur="8.879">were less directly violent so studying</text><text start="3393.13" dur="5.43">the Quakers studying the Jews like</text><text start="3397.329" dur="2.701">there&apos;s some very interesting things</text><text start="3398.56" dur="6.0">regarding how those collective</text><text start="3400.03" dur="7.65">intelligence systems worked Jews</text><text start="3404.56" dur="6.299">specifically being a diaspora not having</text><text start="3407.68" dur="5.58">a physical location to defend or to be</text><text start="3410.859" dur="4.021">able to rest upon had to create this</text><text start="3413.26" dur="3.39">kind of decentralized collective</text><text start="3414.88" dur="6.0">intelligence system to have synchrony</text><text start="3416.65" dur="5.55">well-being in embedding cultures so</text><text start="3420.88" dur="4.89">there&apos;s yeah there&apos;s a bunch of</text><text start="3422.2" dur="5.37">interesting things to study there and of</text><text start="3425.77" dur="3.54">course we can look at the Jains and the</text><text start="3427.57" dur="5.42">Buddhists and groups that historically</text><text start="3429.31" dur="6.99">had non-violence as higher principles</text><text start="3432.99" dur="5.17">and you see that like Tibet can stay</text><text start="3436.3" dur="4.86">safe for a pretty long time until it</text><text start="3438.16" dur="5.4">actually becomes a risk and then it gets</text><text start="3441.16" dur="10.679">taken over by a militaristic force</text><text start="3443.56" dur="10.98">pretty easily right and so one of the</text><text start="3451.839" dur="4.23">tricky things has been and this is like</text><text start="3454.54" dur="3.21">when you look at one of the things that</text><text start="3456.069" dur="6.061">blows my mind is looking at the history</text><text start="3457.75" dur="6.54">of Christianity and saying okay so when</text><text start="3462.13" dur="4.05">we look at the Inquisition or the witch</text><text start="3464.29" dur="3.6">trials or the Crusades or any of the</text><text start="3466.18" dur="4.29">things that said they were in Jesus&apos;s</text><text start="3467.89" dur="4.59">name and then you look at the Gospels of</text><text start="3470.47" dur="3.81">Jesus saying let he who has no sin cast</text><text start="3472.48" dur="3.629">the first stone like how the did</text><text start="3474.28" dur="6.059">people figure out that piece of mental</text><text start="3476.109" dur="6.871">gymnastics to do that thing right so you</text><text start="3480.339" dur="5.76">start to see an evolution and you can</text><text start="3482.98" dur="5.609">see like the Essenes went Jane direction</text><text start="3486.099" dur="3.75">with Christian kind of ideas and then</text><text start="3488.589" dur="3.451">the Crusades went a different direction</text><text start="3489.849" dur="4.74">so it&apos;s almost like you the religion is</text><text start="3492.04" dur="5.37">like a mimetic complex and it can</text><text start="3494.589" dur="4.74">undergo mutation and some of those will</text><text start="3497.41" dur="5.01">have it propagate more and defend itself</text><text start="3499.329" dur="4.471">against external forces more typically</text><text start="3502.42" dur="5.37">those are the ones that move it in the</text><text start="3503.8" dur="7.319">direction of effective violence not</text><text start="3507.79" dur="8.64">always often so one of the big questions</text><text start="3511.119" dur="7.621">becomes how does a peaceful culture stay</text><text start="3516.43" dur="5.159">peaceful well not being overtaken by</text><text start="3518.74" dur="4.619">warring cultures medically economically</text><text start="3521.589" dur="3.701">or military</text><text start="3523.359" dur="3.401">because if the warring culture is</text><text start="3525.29" dur="3.42">willing to initiate that thing in the</text><text start="3526.76" dur="5.04">peaceful culture loses by default then</text><text start="3528.71" dur="4.47">that doesn&apos;t work but if the peaceful</text><text start="3531.8" dur="3.0">culture to be able to defend itself</text><text start="3533.18" dur="3.659">against a militarized culture has to</text><text start="3534.8" dur="4.23">reallocate all of its attention to being</text><text start="3536.839" dur="3.421">better at warfare than the militarized</text><text start="3539.03" dur="6.66">culture it&apos;s not a peaceful culture</text><text start="3540.26" dur="7.92">anymore so there is that&apos;s a question I</text><text start="3545.69" dur="4.62">spent a lot of time with and there are</text><text start="3548.18" dur="3.48">some very interesting insights on that</text><text start="3550.31" dur="10.88">but that&apos;s like a whole that would take</text><text start="3551.66" dur="13.08">another conversation there&apos;s some</text><text start="3561.19" dur="8.26">graphical so I&apos;m curious if you know are</text><text start="3564.74" dur="6.9">there less violent militaristic examples</text><text start="3569.45" dur="4.38">or at least an idea of how to structure</text><text start="3571.64" dur="4.65">a system that isn&apos;t that isolated and</text><text start="3573.83" dur="7.31">still doesn&apos;t involve the militaristic</text><text start="3576.29" dur="4.85">ethos and so I mentioned the Jews and</text><text start="3582.22" dur="6.369">then also even the Quakers when they</text><text start="3584.99" dur="5.19">were say embedded within dominant</text><text start="3588.589" dur="3.991">Protestant and other religions here in</text><text start="3590.18" dur="4.35">the US so you have ones that were not</text><text start="3592.58" dur="4.529">which is different than the Amish who</text><text start="3594.53" dur="5.069">stayed isolated ones that stay isolated</text><text start="3597.109" dur="4.351">is one thing but ones that will be</text><text start="3599.599" dur="3.361">embedded within a dominant culture and</text><text start="3601.46" dur="3.3">interact with that dominant culture and</text><text start="3602.96" dur="4.29">even get positions in the halls of power</text><text start="3604.76" dur="6.3">while being able to maintain fealty to</text><text start="3607.25" dur="5.4">their relationships is that&apos;s actually a</text><text start="3611.06" dur="3.48">very interesting study and I will say</text><text start="3612.65" dur="4.949">that none of them I believe are quite</text><text start="3614.54" dur="6.569">adequate you could take the Masons as</text><text start="3617.599" dur="5.971">another example right which are quite</text><text start="3621.109" dur="10.25">interesting similarly and I mean the</text><text start="3623.57" dur="10.86">Masons mostly after the US was formed so</text><text start="3631.359" dur="6.73">geographic isolation is obviously one</text><text start="3634.43" dur="5.73">factor so what religion we could create</text><text start="3638.089" dur="5.881">on the Mars base is one whole kind of</text><text start="3640.16" dur="6.209">question but the ones that geographic</text><text start="3643.97" dur="4.11">proximity is one question which is what</text><text start="3646.369" dur="3.421">types of rituals require physical</text><text start="3648.08" dur="4.8">embodiment and the people to be able to</text><text start="3649.79" dur="4.89">share in that way versus physical</text><text start="3652.88" dur="3.459">isolation which is which ones require</text><text start="3654.68" dur="6.389">not being infiltrated</text><text start="3656.339" dur="4.73">other memes and other people yeah</text><text start="3661.16" dur="3.939">alright obviously doesn&apos;t really answer</text><text start="3663.239" dur="3.36">the question it just expanded on the</text><text start="3665.099" dur="3.74">question and it&apos;s a really interesting</text><text start="3666.599" dur="6.031">topic and we would need some more time</text><text start="3668.839" dur="14.081">yeah I also I quit like a bit Weinstein</text><text start="3672.63" dur="11.79">thoughts on I with talisman when we</text><text start="3682.92" dur="4.29">talked about how can we create over</text><text start="3684.42" dur="4.47">nations from from the current from from</text><text start="3687.21" dur="3.21">covert 19 you know we&apos;re kind of going</text><text start="3688.89" dur="3.329">through a few of the kind of like</text><text start="3690.42" dur="3.389">factors that make religions great and</text><text start="3692.219" dur="3.471">we&apos;re trying to kind of like see whether</text><text start="3693.809" dur="4.44">you can kind of like almost like</text><text start="3695.69" dur="3.789">modulate movement according to those but</text><text start="3698.249" dur="2.671">the problem is that you know like</text><text start="3699.479" dur="4.231">they&apos;re really really hard to come back</text><text start="3700.92" dur="4.71">fake you know like many of the things</text><text start="3703.71" dur="4.889">that make them work are kind of like</text><text start="3705.63" dur="4.29">because we&apos;ve intrinsically buy into</text><text start="3708.599" dur="4.49">them it&apos;s really hard to engineer</text><text

don&apos;t cause other</text><text start="3847.71" dur="5.91">externalities is there is there like a</text><text start="3851.07" dur="4.38">like a balance to be had between between</text><text start="3853.62" dur="4.68">how much time you spend thinking about a</text><text start="3855.45" dur="3.84">problem versus implementing because for</text><text start="3858.3" dur="2.64">example you can

different realms are quite</text><text start="4776.98" dur="7.17">important because they there&apos;s they&apos;re</text><text start="4779.05" dur="8.31">sort of orthogonal ways of looking at

dur="4.589">there&apos;s one that&apos;s autocratic over the</text><text start="4791.409" dur="5.761">other ones but many times we have them</text><text start="4793.929" dur="6.15">overlapping in

between those</text><text start="4811.42" dur="6.719">different types of institutions was</text><text start="4813.159" dur="9.0">actually a problematic and important and</text><text start="4818.139" dur="7.02">because early became progressively more</text><text start="4822.159" dur="7.681">problematic but like when you think</text><text start="4825.159" dur="6.511">about in the u.s. the separation of the</text><text start="4829.84" dur="4.529">state and the market why we didn&apos;t just</text><text start="4831.67" dur="4.83">have a pure libertarian model we had the</text><text start="4834.369" dur="4.261">idea of a kind of liberal democracy but</text><text start="4836.5" dur="5.699">also the separation of a state and a</text><text start="4838.63" dur="5.1">church then we say liberal democracy and</text><text start="4842.199" dur="7.081">kind of leave the role of the church out</text><text start="4843.73" dur="7.05">and mostly focus on market and and state</text><text start="4849.28" dur="3.33">and yet interestingly you read all of</text><text start="4850.78" dur="3.39">the founding father comments about the</text><text start="4852.61" dur="5.879">need for people to have some kind of</text><text start="4854.17" dur="6.599">moral education as well as a you know</text><text start="4858.489" dur="5.55">formal civic education for anything like</text><text start="4860.769" dur="5.071">democratic process to work the way I</text><text start="4864.039" dur="3.75">think about that and I&apos;ll mention the</text><text start="4865.84" dur="4.759">longer term one the way I think about</text><text start="4867.789" dur="2.81">that briefly is</text><text start="4871.18" dur="8.49">the reason that a state was put in place</text><text start="4875.51" dur="7.38">in this in the kind of us experiment</text><text start="4879.67" dur="5.77">was it was seen that markets could solve</text><text start="4882.89" dur="4.23">most problems or solve a lot of the</text><text start="4885.44" dur="3.54">problems in terms of innovation and</text><text start="4887.12" dur="3.57">efficiency but that they also would lead</text><text start="4888.98" dur="4.08">to organized crime and they would lead</text><text start="4890.69" dur="4.8">to tragedy of the Commons and different</text><text start="4893.06" dur="4.35">types of places where it was</text><text start="4895.49" dur="3.48">incentivized to do things it really</text><text start="4897.41" dur="3.75">created a shitty quality of life for</text><text start="4898.97" dur="6.83">everyone so there was an idea that there</text><text start="4901.16" dur="7.65">was to be a state that had some kind of</text><text start="4905.8" dur="6.79">ability to regulate the most predatory</text><text start="4908.81" dur="5.55">aspects of markets and so there was this</text><text start="4912.59" dur="3.93">idea of law and a monopoly of violence</text><text start="4914.36" dur="4.56">to be able to institute law that was</text><text start="4916.52" dur="5.73">based on jurisprudence which is based on</text><text start="4918.92" dur="5.37">ethics and which is why the founding</text><text start="4922.25" dur="4.65">documents are kind of existential</text><text start="4924.29" dur="4.71">ethical documents and that&apos;s actually</text><text start="4926.9" dur="3.75">where the role of the church came in</text><text start="4929.0" dur="3.57">which was we didn&apos;t want a single Church</text><text start="4930.65" dur="5.1">having dominion over that but the idea</text><text start="4932.57" dur="5.16">that there was Phyllis ah the church and</text><text start="4935.75" dur="3.77">the Academy and that there were deep</text><text start="4937.73" dur="4.77">considerations of what is a good life</text><text start="4939.52" dur="5.77">that is informing ethics it&apos;s informing</text><text start="4942.5" dur="5.88">jurisprudence it&apos;s informing law to be</text><text start="4945.29" dur="4.77">able to bind the predatory aspects of</text><text start="4948.38" dur="3.36">markets will facilitate the helpful</text><text start="4950.06" dur="3.63">aspects of markets simultaneously and</text><text start="4951.74" dur="5.94">kind of the way I see it is that the</text><text start="4953.69" dur="5.82">markets the predatory aspects were</text><text start="4957.68" dur="4.38">designed to be bound by the state but</text><text start="4959.51" dur="5.46">the state was designed to be bound by a</text><text start="4962.06" dur="4.74">educated and engaged populace and where</text><text start="4964.97" dur="4.5">the state was of foreign by the people</text><text start="4966.8" dur="5.46">and otherwise you get the watchdog issue</text><text start="4969.47" dur="4.56">where you have maximum incentive for the</text><text start="4972.26" dur="3.18">market forces to capture the regulatory</text><text start="4974.03" dur="5.13">forces and then just get crony</text><text start="4975.44" dur="5.91">capitalism but in order for and then the</text><text start="4979.16" dur="3.63">people are actually bound by the market</text><text start="4981.35" dur="2.88">which means accounting that they can&apos;t</text><text start="4982.79" dur="3.12">ask for rights they aren&apos;t willing to</text><text start="4984.23" dur="3.6">take responsibilities for and they can&apos;t</text><text start="4985.91" dur="3.63">you know implement where the where</text><text start="4987.83" dur="3.06">the accounting doesn&apos;t work out and if</text><text start="4989.54" dur="3.69">you kind of think of that there&apos;s a</text><text start="4990.89" dur="8.19">really nice balance in it but it&apos;s easy</text><text start="4993.23" dur="7.49">to see how a symmetries of power emerged</text><text start="4999.08" dur="4.569">where even though there&apos;s aggregate</text><text start="5000.72" dur="4.429">symmetry between supply side and demands</text><text start="5003.649" dur="4.441">there&apos;s more coordination on supply-side</text><text start="5005.149" dur="5.22">than there is undemanding asymmetric</text><text start="5008.09" dur="5.569">information Warfare&apos;s that lead to a</text><text start="5010.369" dur="6.86">less educated ant+ just natural human</text><text start="5013.659" dur="5.77">weakness at scale that lead to the</text><text start="5017.229" dur="4.031">population not checking the government</text><text start="5019.429" dur="4.331">and then the state force the market</text><text start="5021.26" dur="4.54">forces capturing it</text><text start="5023.76" dur="4.02">so I think there&apos;s some stuff that can</text><text start="5025.8" dur="3.72">be done to actually reverse this</text><text start="5027.78" dur="3.69">institutional decay and make a better</text><text start="5029.52" dur="4.74">version of this thing and I&apos;m actually</text><text start="5031.47" dur="5.13">very interested in that I don&apos;t think it</text><text start="5034.26" dur="5.46">meets the sufficiency criteria long term</text><text start="5036.6" dur="6.75">and so then the question of what is a</text><text start="5039.72" dur="7.8">more visionary long term distribution of</text><text start="5043.35" dur="6.81">power and choice making look like I can</text><text start="5047.52" dur="4.59">say that I don&apos;t know because we haven&apos;t</text><text start="5050.16" dur="3.51">implemented it and the ideas that I have</text><text start="5052.11" dur="4.77">about it I don&apos;t know if will work but I</text><text start="5053.67" dur="6.89">hit I have thoughts on this topic that</text><text start="5056.88" dur="11.49">have to do with one of the ways that I</text><text start="5060.56" dur="9.61">frame it up if you think about if you</text><text start="5068.37" dur="4.71">think about kind of Jeffery West&apos;s</text><text start="5070.17" dur="5.67">analysis and scale and the</text><text start="5073.08" dur="5.85">correspondence of that with kind of</text><text start="5075.84" dur="6.57">Dunbar society limits and the idea that</text><text start="5078.93" dur="5.27">in general intended groups of people</text><text start="5082.41" dur="4.41">whether they&apos;re companies or countries</text><text start="5084.2" dur="5.26">get diminishing collective intelligence</text><text start="5086.82" dur="5.33">and productive capacity at scale beyond</text><text start="5089.46" dur="5.69">give or take in evolutionary tribal size</text><text start="5092.15" dur="5.65">then that ends up creating a basis for</text><text start="5095.15" dur="5.17">smaller groups to be more intelligent</text><text start="5097.8" dur="4.47">relative to the larger group and you</text><text start="5100.32" dur="4.29">both have an incentive for defection and</text><text start="5102.27" dur="3.6">the capacity to defect and get away with</text><text start="5104.61" dur="3.629">it because the larger group becomes</text><text start="5105.87" dur="4.56">stupider and can&apos;t do the appropriate</text><text start="5108.239" dur="4.171">accounting so you end up getting niches</text><text start="5110.43" dur="5.7">for sociopathic predatory behavior on</text><text start="5112.41" dur="5.49">this system whereas if you had linear</text><text start="5116.13" dur="4.26">development or super linear development</text><text start="5117.9" dur="4.65">of collective intelligence as a function</text><text start="5120.39" dur="4.02">of scale as you go above Dunbar number</text><text start="5122.55" dur="4.14">you could have the group be smart enough</text><text start="5124.41" dur="5.49">to actually notice and bind the</text><text start="5126.69" dur="5.13">sociopathic defections where everyone</text><text start="5129.9" dur="3.24">would do better by being by</text><text start="5131.82" dur="2.79">participating

dur="7.02">yeah I I will also say I don&apos;t know the</text><text start="5287.3" dur="3.3">answer to this would need to look in it</text><text start="5288.949" dur="3.891">more depth but a few thoughts that come</text><text start="5290.6" dur="5.389">to mind</text><text start="5292.84" dur="5.52">I think states can do totally up</text><text start="5295.989" dur="3.811">stuff and have people who are very power</text><text start="5298.36" dur="4.799">seeking at the level states even at the</text><text start="5299.8" dur="4.74">level of cities but they don&apos;t have like</text><text

does they don&apos;t</text><text start="5307.679" dur="3.911">states have a National Guard but they</text><text start="5309.88" dur="6.02">don&apos;t have weapons of mass destruction</text><text start="5311.59" dur="7.56">and they don&apos;t have the same types of</text><text start="5315.9" dur="4.93">massive power consolidation so I think</text><text start="5319.15" dur="4.02">the Tenth Amendment is very important</text><text start="5320.83" dur="4.05">and I think the movements to an</text><text start="5323.17" dur="3.06">increased Tim&apos;s like when we talk about</text><text start="5324.88" dur="4.08">things that could get worse or better</text><text start="5326.23" dur="5.46">right now in the US the idea that states</text><text start="5328.96" dur="4.92">become more relevant is actually a</text><text start="5331.69" dur="6.21">possibly very good idea whit while</text><text start="5333.88" dur="5.67">having the factor for right and left</text><text start="5337.9" dur="3.449">states moving in further apart</text><text start="5339.55" dur="3.419">directions and increased tension between</text><text start="5341.349" dur="3.75">them so we we have to factor for that</text><text start="5342.969" dur="4.681">but that&apos;s mostly engineered that&apos;s</text><text start="5345.099" dur="5.341">mostly narrative or fair engineered and</text><text start="5347.65" dur="4.44">could be addressed but I do think taking</text><text start="5350.44" dur="4.199">it beyond the state down to the city</text><text start="5352.09" dur="4.68">level is better because cities are real</text><text start="5354.639" dur="3.901">things and states are fictions just like</text><text start="5356.77" dur="4.86">nation states are fictions like where</text><text start="5358.54" dur="5.94">the boundary is is we&apos;ve determined in a</text><text start="5361.63" dur="5.79">war or a trade or whatever but cities</text><text start="5364.48" dur="4.949">are based on the actual goods and</text><text start="5367.42" dur="3.63">services and transportation dynamics</text><text start="5369.429" dur="5.581">that need to be within a particular</text><text start="5371.05" dur="5.43">space of each other so I think and this</text><text start="5375.01" dur="3.629">is what Jeffrey West was showing and</text><text start="5376.48" dur="4.08">scale was that cities actually do have</text><text start="5378.639" dur="3.48">productive capacity that can be linear</text><text start="5380.56" dur="3.929">or super linear as a function of</text><text start="5382.119" dur="5.341">population so I think having more</text><text start="5384.489" dur="5.371">governance at the level of cities is</text><text start="5387.46" dur="4.29">very interesting and then having</text><text start="5389.86" dur="4.14">coalition&apos;s of cities network network</text><text start="5391.75" dur="4.8">dynamics between cities cities and the</text><text start="5394.0" dur="4.32">surrounding metropolitan areas pretty</text><text start="5396.55" dur="7.74">much defined by transportation dynamics</text><text start="5398.32" dur="7.2">and there are obviously also tricky</text><text start="5404.29" dur="3.3">things we&apos;re like let&apos;s say we&apos;re</text><text start="5405.52" dur="4.04">dealing with a pandemic where let&apos;s say</text><text start="5407.59" dur="4.259">an area closes off its border and</text><text start="5409.56" dur="5.23">figures out how to become a Green Zone</text><text start="5411.849" dur="5.431">but the other areas adjacent to it don&apos;t</text><text start="5414.79" dur="5.369">well it doesn&apos;t actually get to reopen</text><text start="5417.28" dur="5.609">its border and re-issue life without the</text><text start="5420.159" dur="4.471">other areas doing that or you know one</text><text start="5422.889" dur="3.341">person can cause the infections again so</text><text start="5424.63" dur="3.46">this is a place where the</text><text start="5426.23" dur="3.45">rights of individual places and their</text><text start="5428.09" dur="4.17">responsibilities to each other are just</text><text start="5429.68" dur="7.47">so profoundly connected which is why</text><text start="5432.26" dur="6.42">this is such a big deal I think one I</text><text start="5437.15" dur="3.3">think there&apos;s some stuff that&apos;s</text><text start="5438.68" dur="4.35">up about the way tests have been blocked</text><text start="5440.45" dur="4.68">and rolled out I think I think there&apos;s a</text><text start="5443.03" dur="3.45">lot about it but I also think that</text><text start="5445.13" dur="3.72">there&apos;s a lot that&apos;s really bad about</text><text start="5446.48" dur="4.98">the tests like I don&apos;t think the</text><text start="5448.85" dur="6.06">immunoassays are useful for tests and</text><text start="5451.46" dur="6.18">trace or really diagnosis for</text><text start="5454.91" dur="4.47">suppression at all there it takes too</text><text start="5457.64" dur="3.39">many days from the time you were exposed</text><text start="5459.38" dur="6.48">and are infectious for the antibodies to</text><text start="5461.03" dur="6.93">show up and the even even if you have</text><text start="5465.86" dur="4.35">one that had very low false negatives at</text><text start="5467.96" dur="3.48">that point and then there&apos;s too much</text><text start="5470.21" dur="3.21">that isn&apos;t known about what the</text><text start="5471.44" dur="4.08">antibodies actually mean yet or how long</text><text start="5473.42" dur="4.2">they last or the decay rate on them or</text><text start="5475.52" dur="5.97">any of those things so I think we would</text><text start="5477.62" dur="7.38">need high sensitivity pcr that could be</text><text start="5481.49" dur="5.58">very very widely utilized to be able to</text><text start="5485.0" dur="5.7">have testing really become very</text><text start="5487.07" dur="5.52">meaningful as a suppression strategy and</text><text start="5490.7" dur="3.15">so we&apos;re not waiting for antibody</text><text start="5492.59" dur="3.09">response in the blood we&apos;re being able</text><text start="5493.85" dur="4.19">to detect presence of the virus in the</text><text start="5495.68" dur="4.83">mucosa so you know nasal and oral swabs</text><text start="5498.04" dur="7.12">and I think</text><text start="5500.51" dur="6.33">I think we could roll out specific areas</text><text start="5505.16" dur="3.33">could roll out those types of</text><text start="5506.84" dur="5.57">diagnostics and be able to show the</text><text start="5508.49" dur="7.29">effectiveness of it mostly commercially</text><text start="5512.41" dur="6.13">and with local governments participation</text><text start="5515.78" dur="5.04">and I think if it showed enough</text><text start="5518.54" dur="4.23">effectiveness so like we&apos;re talking with</text><text start="5520.82" dur="3.81">some people in Las Vegas because Las</text><text start="5522.77" dur="3.84">Vegas is very focused on reopening</text><text start="5524.63" dur="3.54">because they&apos;re losing like a billion</text><text start="5526.61" dur="3.48">dollars a week per casino or whatever</text><text start="5528.17" dur="6.54">staying closed so they really want to</text><text start="5530.09" dur="7.11">reopen but Vegas by itself reopening</text><text start="5534.71" dur="3.81">could cause the infection to never go in</text><text start="5537.2" dur="3.54">the world because people come from all</text><text start="5538.52" dur="4.62">over touch everything together in a</text><text start="5540.74" dur="3.66">closed air environment it circulated air</text><text start="5543.14" dur="3.27">and then fly back to the rest of the</text><text start="5544.4" dur="3.99">world but they also have all the money</text><text start="5546.41" dur="3.36">to actually do the thing properly and</text><text start="5548.39" dur="2.22">the local government gets enough money</text><text start="5549.77" dur="3.12">from them they want to really</text><text start="5550.61" dur="4.32">participate so they could roll out HEPA</text><text start="5552.89" dur="3.84">filters and pecco filters and nanotech</text><text start="5554.93" dur="4.29">surface treatments and detection</text><text start="5556.73" dur="7.2">mechanisms and get the security on them</text><text start="5559.22" dur="7.74">right and and point-of-contact rapid</text><text start="5563.93" dur="5.01">turnaround pcr Diagnostics and actually</text><text start="5566.96" dur="4.53">be able to invest the capital to show</text><text start="5568.94" dur="4.32">the effectiveness to then be able to</text><text start="5571.49" dur="3.63">lower the economies of scale and the</text><text start="5573.26" dur="3.39">questions of if it&apos;s true or not to then</text><text start="5575.12" dur="4.79">get them implemented other places so I&apos;m</text><text start="5576.65" dur="6.45">interested in some of those approaches</text><text start="5579.91" dur="14.95">thank you so much for joining today I</text><text start="5583.1" dur="15.68">mean intended so bye bye everyone see</text><text
