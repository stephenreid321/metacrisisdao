Civilization — A Critique</text><text start="6.89" dur="1.0">Introduction</text><text start="7.89" dur="1.4">We are living in a peculiar time.</text><text start="9.29" dur="7.829">Before the modern times, countries, great
empires, and entire civilizations rose and</text><text start="17.119" dur="1.0">fell.</text><text start="18.119" dur="6.031">Usually when they fell, they left others intact
— they didn’t bring them down as well.</text><text start="24.15" dur="7.129">But now, the current technologically advancing
global civilization has the capacity of destroying</text><text start="31.279" dur="3.081">itself, along with all of humanity.</text><text start="34.36" dur="6.519">Game B is an attempt at figuring out how a
different type of social system could look</text><text start="40.879" dur="6.07">like, that would allow for a stable existence
of human civilization.</text><text start="46.949" dur="7.96">I will present here one particular version
of Game B, as envisaged by Daniel Schmachtenberger.</text><text start="54.909" dur="7.891">I will also present some of my criticisms
and questions that it needs to answer.</text><text start="62.8" dur="5.81">Because I will focus on one man’s take on
the problem, naturally there will be many</text><text start="68.61" dur="7.69">things I say that may very well be addressed
by others thinking about Game B. I am not</text><text start="76.3" dur="6.67">presenting and critiquing Game B in its entirety,
but one perspective on it.</text><text start="82.97" dur="8.6">Other notable thinkers working under the Game
B umbrella are Jim Rutt, Bret Weinstein, Jordan</text><text start="91.57" dur="4.25">Greenhall, Forrest Landry, and Ben Goertzel.</text><text start="95.82" dur="7.41">In my critique I will draw heavily from existing
criticisms of technology, in particular that</text><text start="103.23" dur="1.39">of Ted Kaczynski.</text><text start="104.62" dur="6.58">It’s because Schmachtenberger and Kaczynski
have a lot in common in their thinking about</text><text start="111.2" dur="6.68">technology — they rely on game theory and
complex systems theory in their analyses.</text><text start="117.88" dur="6.96">Of course, they depart in major ways, especially
when we’re talking about solutions.</text><text start="124.84" dur="8.739">I will also use some criticisms by other anti-technology
philosophers: Jacques Ellul and John Zerzan.</text><text start="133.579" dur="2.621">Who is Daniel Schmachtenberger?</text><text start="136.2" dur="6.599">Daniel was home taught, meaning he was free
to pursue and explore his own interests without</text><text start="142.799" dur="2.841">being confined in a rigid curriculum.</text><text start="145.64" dur="5.689">He gained a lot of understanding of complex
systems science that studies the processes</text><text start="151.329" dur="6.691">of large wholes emerging out of local interactions
between the elements, like ants doing very</text><text start="158.02" dur="8.169">simple tasks that leads to the entire colony
being able to intelligently respond and adapt</text><text start="166.189" dur="1.951">to its environment.</text><text start="168.14" dur="6.579">He is a systems thinker, who analyzes and
understands various domains of the world as</text><text start="174.719" dur="2.31">such interacting systems.</text><text start="177.029" dur="8.86">He is also a founder at Neurohacker Collective,
that aims to optimize human cognitive faculties.</text><text start="185.889" dur="3.151">What is the problem with our civilization?</text><text start="189.04" dur="6.3">Game B is an attempt at figuring out a solution
to the problem with our current civilization.</text><text start="195.34" dur="4.539">So what is the problem with our civilization?</text><text start="199.879" dur="1.0">The symptoms</text><text start="200.879" dur="7.961">In nature, we find that power is evenly distributed
across the members of a given population.</text><text start="208.84" dur="4.72">The fastest lion is only a bit better than
the average lion.</text><text start="213.56" dur="2.689">There are no huge differences.</text><text start="216.249" dur="5.39">And between the rivalrous groups — say,
lions and gazelles — there are symmetries</text><text start="221.639" dur="1.731">of power.</text><text start="223.37" dur="2.379">Gazelles are also very fast.</text><text start="225.749" dur="4.151">Most healthy gazelles can escape a lion attack.</text><text start="229.9" dur="4.559">Sometimes a gazelle runs away, sometimes a
lion gets a kill.</text><text start="234.459" dur="6.71">By being so close to each other in power level,
they can live alongside each other, constantly</text><text start="241.169" dur="3.991">exerting pressure for the other to get a bit
better.</text><text start="245.16" dur="7.219">The lions get better, but only a little, and
only as much as gazelles get better.</text><text start="252.379" dur="2.92">They keep each other in check.</text><text start="255.299" dur="5.491">A natural predator can only kill as much prey
as he can eat.</text><text start="260.79" dur="2.11">And he can’t eat much at once.</text><text start="262.9" dur="4.79">A predator is not super-powerful compared
to the prey.</text><text start="267.69" dur="1.57">But we are.</text><text start="269.26" dur="5.77">We can catch so many fish at once that we
have to count them in tons.</text><text start="275.03" dur="2.82">We no longer are mere predators.</text><text start="277.85" dur="5.3">This is because of our use of constantly improving
tools and machines.</text><text start="283.15" dur="3.17">We’ve broken the symmetry of power.</text><text start="286.32" dur="6.47">That means that we’re unable to maintain
stability in the environments we live in.</text><text start="292.79" dur="6.72">With scarce resources and in a rivalrous game
theoretic setting, there are strong incentives</text><text start="299.51" dur="7.03">to not only withhold information about the
world, but there are also incentives to misinform</text><text start="306.54" dur="2.45">the other groups about the world.</text><text start="308.99" dur="7.58">A system of selective pressures creates such
perverse incentives to misinform, lie, generally</text><text start="316.57" dur="6.84">to engage in information warfare to benefit
oneself or one’s group at the expense of</text><text start="323.41" dur="1.95">the larger community.</text><text start="325.36" dur="6.77">If someone chooses not to play by those bad
rules, he looses to the ones who do.</text><text start="332.13" dur="5.971">The ethical ones are simply being replaced
by the less ethical, so it’s better for</text><text start="338.101" dur="5.389">you not be so virtuous as to remove yourself
from the game.</text><text start="343.49" dur="6.79">The unethical system convinces the ethical
people to compromise on their ethics to become</text><text start="350.28" dur="2.2">the tool for the system.</text><text start="352.48" dur="1.71">The prognosis</text><text start="354.19" dur="5.17">We have identified the symptoms that ail the
modern world.</text><text start="359.36" dur="3.68">What is the prognosis for the patient — for
humanity?</text><text start="363.04" dur="7.27">The symptoms of the disintegration of our
civilization are intrinsically linked to technology.</text><text start="370.31" dur="7.09">We constantly make better technology and we
use this technology to make even better technology.</text><text start="377.4" dur="4.88">With each decade we observe some technological
breakthroughs.</text><text start="382.28" dur="1.96">And normally that’s OK.</text><text start="384.24" dur="7.32">We want innovations, new medical procedures,
more computational power, novel forms of communication,</text><text start="391.56" dur="1.99">more efficient powerhouses.</text><text start="393.55" dur="6.54">But alongside all that clearly beneficial
tech, we have developments that pose grave</text><text start="400.09" dur="3.97">danger to the future of entire human civilization.</text><text start="404.06" dur="7.02">We not only have a few national superpowers
armed with nuclear weapons, but we’re witnessing</text><text start="411.08" dur="3.14">the emergence of new kinds of technology.</text><text start="414.22" dur="6.25">We’re talking about exponential technology
— the technology that we use to make better</text><text start="420.47" dur="5.77">forms of technology, that are also easier
to use by smaller groups.</text><text start="426.24" dur="5.87">That would include genetic engineering with
the possibility of creating deadly viruses,</text><text start="432.11" dur="6.38">artificial intelligence aimed at optimizing
for a mundane task but with unforeseen but</text><text start="438.49" dur="7.41">disastrous consequences, and nanotechnology
that could allow creating miniature weapons.</text><text start="445.9" dur="6.0">All this points to a bleak picture of the
future where we destroy the environment, making</text><text start="451.9" dur="3.45">most of the planet unsuitable for us to live
on.</text><text start="455.35" dur="6.51">In the darkest of scenarios, we eradicate
ourselves altogether, or even most complex</text><text start="461.86" dur="1.95">life on the planet.</text><text start="463.81" dur="1.91">The root cause</text><text start="465.72" dur="6.45">Why don’t we use technology for the benefit
of all, and instead we use it to extract natural</text><text start="472.17" dur="2.71">resources and ruin the environment?</text><text start="474.88" dur="6.02">Why do we make this technology and why do
we use it in such destructive ways?</text><text start="480.9" dur="6.5">It’s because when one group starts to use
technology to extract some natural resources,</text><text start="487.4" dur="6.76">while polluting the environment, this group
gets a major advantage over its competitors.</text><text start="494.16" dur="5.69">So they now have to do the same or else they
will be out-competed.</text><text start="499.85" dur="6.64">And after a while we have a situation where
no one can stop, because if they stop, the</text><text start="506.49" dur="6.36">others will continue to abuse the environment,
and a new group will take their place.</text><text start="512.85" dur="5.93">So it creates a race to the bottom where a
short-term gain is beneficial for every such</text><text start="518.78" dur="5.6">group, but in the long-term their actions
lead to disastrous consequences for everyone.</text><text start="524.38" dur="6.31">As long as we’re having separate interests,
there are incentives to game the game, whatever</text><text start="530.69" dur="1.64">it is.</text><text start="532.33" dur="4.47">Economy is a system that predisposes people
to do certain things.</text><text start="536.8" dur="4.04">It creates extrinsic incentives or motivations.</text><text start="540.84" dur="5.74">This is done through currency — everything
can be seen as exchangeable and usable.</text><text start="546.58" dur="6.21">The only things we see and focus on are the
things we can convert into currency.</text><text start="552.79" dur="7.51">But economy makes it impossible to value or
optimize for many non-exchangeable goods,</text><text start="560.3" dur="4.32">such as songbirds, nature, personal enjoyment.</text><text start="564.62" dur="6.58">Currency as a metric doesn’t capture many
otherwise valuable goods, goods that are shared</text><text start="571.2" dur="1.68">by all of us.</text><text start="572.88" dur="6.86">When this system acquires exponential technology,
it becomes a self-terminating one, because</text><text start="579.74" dur="6.18">it can’t leave the natural resources alone
— they have to be converted into things,</text><text start="585.92" dur="2.79">measurable by currency.</text><text start="588.71" dur="1.0">The solution</text><text start="589.71" dur="6.66">Now that we know the state of our global civilization,
the root cause and the prediction based on</text><text start="596.37" dur="4.56">the current trajectory, we can ask “what
can we do about it?”</text><text start="600.93" dur="3.63">Daniel attempts at giving a fragmentary answer.</text><text start="604.56" dur="4.0">The answer consists of two general parts.</text><text start="608.56" dur="5.8">One part is to give constraints that any workable
plan has to meet.</text><text start="614.36" dur="5.39">The other is to provide some ideas that can
fit the overall plan.</text><text start="619.75" dur="5.27">When I’m saying that this is a fragmentary
answer, I don’t mean it in a derogatory</text><text start="625.02" dur="1.0">way.</text><text start="626.02" dur="5.52">We simply don’t know enough to provide a
full plan with a step-by-step process, and</text><text start="631.54" dur="3.02">Daniel is perfectly aware of that.</text><text start="634.56" dur="3.86">The constraints on any potential plan</text><text start="638.42" dur="7.24">When it comes to the parameters that any viable
program must work under, we immediately see</text><text start="645.66" dur="7.99">that Schmachtenberger focuses almost exclusively
on people and social relations, rather than</text><text start="653.65" dur="1.72">technology itself.</text><text start="655.37" dur="7.76">This is in a stark contrast with major philosophers
of technology, such as John Zerzan, Ted Kaczynski,</text><text start="663.13" dur="1.82">or Jacques Ellul.</text><text start="664.95" dur="5.3">There are many problems that can lead us to
the collapse of civilization.</text><text start="670.25" dur="7.42">Various existential threats (AI, climate change,
etc.) are only instances of an underlying</text><text start="677.67" dur="1.9">category of problems.</text><text start="679.57" dur="6.19">There is something fundamental that generates
these problems or that creates conditions</text><text start="685.76" dur="2.36">for such threats to arise.</text><text start="688.12" dur="7.12">So we must deal with these generator functions
rather than specific instances.</text><text start="695.24" dur="4.98">Technologically advanced rivalrous groups
that aim to seek benefits for themselves at</text><text start="700.22" dur="5.869">the expense of the commons are such generator
functions of existential threats.</text><text start="706.089" dur="6.181">And because we can’t stop technology, we
have to transform society from rivalrous to</text><text start="712.27" dur="1.91">cooperative.</text><text start="714.18" dur="6.57">So a workable plan has to solve not the mere
manifestations of the problems, but those</text><text start="720.75" dur="4.63">fundamental principles that give rise to various
problems.</text><text start="725.38" dur="6.89">The drive for competition is based on us having
separate interests — I can get ahead by</text><text start="732.27" dur="1.79">winning over you.</text><text start="734.06" dur="5.99">Whenever there are possibilities to succeed
by screwing others, it will keep happening.</text><text start="740.05" dur="6.78">This has to be changed so that the well-being
of every person is tight to the well-being</text><text start="746.83" dur="6.42">of others, and the only way to prosper is
by helping others prosper.</text><text start="753.25" dur="5.43">Participating in the system has to be more
advantageous than going against it.</text><text start="758.68" dur="1.53">Ideas for the future</text><text start="760.21" dur="5.69">Daniel notices that the way we’re doing
social science is essentially broken, because</text><text start="765.9" dur="7.1">we’re studying societies that get ahead
of others by destroying them through competition.</text><text start="773.0" dur="6.26">But studying rivalrous social systems can
only lead us to conclusions that that’s</text><text start="779.26" dur="2.92">how societies inherently operate.</text><text start="782.18" dur="6.27">But it doesn’t mean that other social systems
are impossible, because we don’t have a</text><text start="788.45" dur="2.5">representative sample of societies.</text><text start="790.95" dur="6.5">So we conclude that various destructive features
are intrinsic to human nature.</text><text start="797.45" dur="4.22">But in fact, they result from cultural conditioning.</text><text start="801.67" dur="6.38">We could have a social environment, where
people wouldn’t be conditioned for selfishness,</text><text start="808.05" dur="4.14">but for cooperation for the long-term common
good.</text><text start="812.19" dur="6.36">Some of such systems are smaller tribes, where
everybody knows, depends on, and cares for</text><text start="818.55" dur="1.55">everybody else.</text><text start="820.1" dur="7.42">In such small communities, people can support
each other and hold each other accountable.</text><text start="827.52" dur="5.96">Sustainable advanced civilization would have
to scale this principle, so that everybody</text><text start="833.48" dur="3.18">cares for everybody else.</text><text start="836.66" dur="6.049">It doesn’t seem possible to sustain a large
global population of people who would live</text><text start="842.709" dur="4.381">a high quality of life that people in the
affluent countries enjoy.</text><text start="847.09" dur="2.6">What’s necessary is depopulation.</text><text start="849.69" dur="6.39">We’re already seeing rapid lowering of birth
rates in advanced societies.</text><text start="856.08" dur="7.73">At the time of writing, we have approximately
90-130 countries that are below replacement</text><text start="863.81" dur="1.0">rate.</text><text start="864.81" dur="6.79">What this suggests is that populations of
many countries will go down for some time,</text><text start="871.6" dur="3.56">and then they will most likely stabilize.</text><text start="875.16" dur="5.86">Various factors influence fertility rate,
such as calories per day, health of the children</text><text start="881.02" dur="5.961">and child mortality rate, income and wealth,
education — especially for women, access</text><text start="886.981" dur="6.228">to contraception, abortion, family planning,
integration of women into the labor force,</text><text start="893.209" dur="2.711">age at first marriage for women.</text><text start="895.92" dur="5.5">With time, we can expect more countries to
get industrialized, educated, and wealthy.</text><text start="901.42" dur="6.49">We can expect their populations to also start
going down up to a stable size.</text><text start="907.91" dur="5.52">This would make it possible for everyone to
enjoy a high quality of life.</text><text start="913.43" dur="5.51">With a smaller world population, it would
be possible for everybody to get access to</text><text start="918.94" dur="1.81">education and stuff.</text><text start="920.75" dur="4.37">But we can’t just throw stuff away, as it
wastes resources.</text><text start="925.12" dur="5.38">The idea is to bind produced things in a closed-loop
economy.</text><text start="930.5" dur="7.769">By that we mean that produced things are given
to people and when they break or are replaced</text><text start="938.269" dur="7.221">or no longer used, then they are scrapped
and completely recycled into raw materials,</text><text start="945.49" dur="3.09">so that new things will be made from them.</text><text start="948.58" dur="5.87">And that should be possible with the ever
advancing green energy.</text><text start="954.45" dur="6.09">Everyone would get access to things, as they
would get a service to use these things and</text><text start="960.54" dur="2.82">have them fixed and replaced.</text><text start="963.36" dur="1.21">The critique</text><text start="964.57" dur="5.99">The analysis of the problems and the causes
of those problems of modern civilization seem</text><text start="970.56" dur="3.38">very accurate, complex, and nuanced.</text><text start="973.94" dur="3.14">But how well do they fare?</text><text start="977.08" dur="1.0">Education</text><text start="978.08" dur="5.64">Daniel designs a social system, where the
population would be educated in the “science</text><text start="983.72" dur="5.989">of government” and other domains that would
allow people to understand interrelated problems</text><text start="989.709" dur="5.101">in the world and come up with good proposals
for solutions.</text><text start="994.81" dur="3.77">How plausible is such an educational system?</text><text start="998.58" dur="7.449">How smart do we have to be to understand how
the government works and be able to meaningfully</text><text start="1006.029" dur="1.0">participate?</text><text start="1007.029" dur="3.401">What about personal interests and inclinations?</text><text start="1010.43" dur="6.67">Some people are interested in arts, some in
engineering, some in sports, some in still</text><text start="1017.1" dur="1.13">other things.</text><text start="1018.23" dur="6.809">Are we all able to appreciate the “science
of government” enough to want to track the</text><text start="1025.039" dur="4.221">development of government for our entire lives?</text><text start="1029.26" dur="5.919">These are only some of the questions that
need answering just to say whether jump-starting</text><text start="1035.179" dur="4.921">the process of transitioning to the new civilization
is possible.</text><text start="1040.1" dur="1.849">When do people defect?</text><text start="1041.949" dur="6.201">Daniel says that as long as defecting from
the system is more advantageous than participating</text><text start="1048.15" dur="6.279">fairly, it will keep happening and some groups
will go against the common good for their</text><text start="1054.429" dur="1.231">own benefit.</text><text start="1055.66" dur="7.19">The implication being that if defecting is
not more advantageous, then it will not happen.</text><text start="1062.85" dur="2.41">But this conclusion doesn’t follow.</text><text start="1065.26" dur="3.59">It could be the case were we all very rational
beings.</text><text start="1068.85" dur="2.13">But we aren’t.</text><text start="1070.98" dur="6.17">Sometimes we decide to do something on incomplete
information, because of errors in reasoning,</text><text start="1077.15" dur="4.85">or when we’re swayed by strong emotions,
or by mistakes.</text><text start="1082.0" dur="6.03">Groups can still defect from the system, even
when it isn’t ultimately beneficial for</text><text start="1088.03" dur="2.11">them, for such reasons.</text><text start="1090.14" dur="7.72">And when these groups have access to exponential
technology, such as AI, biotechnology, nanotechnology,</text><text start="1097.86" dur="5.75">we get back to the starting point, where we
are at great risk of those technologies being</text><text start="1103.61" dur="3.71">catastrophically misused.</text><text start="1107.32" dur="2.609">Unpredictability of complex dynamical social
systems</text><text start="1109.929" dur="7.761">Ted Kaczynski introduced a concept of self-propagating
systems, based on our knowledge of game theory</text><text start="1117.69" dur="1.59">and complex systems.</text><text start="1119.28" dur="6.82">A self-propagating system is any system that
can maintain itself and preserve itself, such</text><text start="1126.1" dur="3.94">as an organism, an institution, a corporation.</text><text start="1130.04" dur="7.49">It seems that in any institution a self-propagating
system can arise that has goals not aligned</text><text start="1137.53" dur="2.84">with the goals of the containing system.</text><text start="1140.37" dur="6.46">A collection of such systems functions in
similar ways to how species interact through</text><text start="1146.83" dur="1.14">evolution.</text><text start="1147.97" dur="3.65">These self-propagating systems grow larger
and larger.</text><text start="1151.62" dur="5.9">The ones that do not grow are out-competed
by the ones that do.</text><text start="1157.52" dur="7.11">Such a system looks for and exploits every
opportunity to gain more power.</text><text start="1164.63" dur="4.99">If it doesn’t, it’s being replaced by
those that do.</text><text start="1169.62" dur="5.98">Focusing on short-term gains, even at the
cost of long-term adverse effects, gives the</text><text start="1175.6" dur="3.99">system major advantages over the competition.</text><text start="1179.59" dur="4.56">This is enough to grow larger than those other
ones.</text><text start="1184.15" dur="6.25">These points lead us to a conclusion that
self-propagating systems will grow larger</text><text start="1190.4" dur="6.36">and larger and will be more and more ferocious
with their use of natural resources, ignoring</text><text start="1196.76" dur="1.54">long-term consequences.</text><text start="1198.3" dur="7.07">Ultimately, the result will be the total collapse
of the world, making it unsuitable for complex</text><text start="1205.37" dur="1.03">life.</text><text start="1206.4" dur="4.399">Daniel Schmachtenberger disagrees that this
is inevitable.</text><text start="1210.799" dur="5.961">According to him, it is possible to design
a social system, where there would be no incentives</text><text start="1216.76" dur="6.85">for short-term gains or that short-term gains
would not be greater than focusing on long-term</text><text start="1223.61" dur="2.37">stability and ecology.</text><text start="1225.98" dur="2.95">But can this be actually true?</text><text start="1228.93" dur="6.55">Because socio-economical global civilization
is a complex system of complex systems, it’s</text><text start="1235.48" dur="6.03">more plausible to think that there will always
be various loopholes and backdoors we couldn’t</text><text start="1241.51" dur="6.82">account for, such that they can and will be
exploited by greedy self-propagating systems</text><text start="1248.33" dur="5.49">for gaining power at the cost of the common
long-term health of the entire humanity.</text><text start="1253.82" dur="6.56">It’s difficult to believe that a system
without those problems is possible.</text><text start="1260.38" dur="6.82">If it is, I think we would need a much stronger,
formalized argument to show that this is indeed</text><text start="1267.2" dur="1.37">possible.</text><text start="1268.57" dur="3.88">This is connected with another point Kaczynski
makes.</text><text start="1272.45" dur="7.19">Complex systems, such as a society, climate,
ecosystem, are systems of interconnected elements.</text><text start="1279.64" dur="7.22">They behave in a nonlinear fashion, that is
an increase in some parameter (e.g. temperature)</text><text start="1286.86" dur="4.02">may lead to disproportionately huge results.</text><text start="1290.88" dur="6.36">The characteristics of a complex system tell
us very little that could help us in guessing</text><text start="1297.24" dur="2.1">what the system will do.</text><text start="1299.34" dur="6.339">We often observe novel behaviors on the scale
of the entire systems — so called emergent</text><text start="1305.679" dur="1.571">behaviors.</text><text start="1307.25" dur="3.43">Many complex systems function in chaotic ways.</text><text start="1310.68" dur="5.08">This means that their behavior is unpredictable,
even in principle.</text><text start="1315.76" dur="5.34">Just a tiny difference in the model of such
a system will lead to completely different</text><text start="1321.1" dur="2.32">results and conclusions.</text><text start="1323.42" dur="4.759">The farther we go into the future with our
predictions, the worse they are.</text><text start="1328.179" dur="6.331">If we can’t predict how the society will
evolve, how can Schmachtenberger claim we</text><text start="1334.51" dur="5.7">can control its evolution, and how can we
say that certain changes in the society will</text><text start="1340.21" dur="3.39">lead to positive effects in the long run?</text><text start="1343.6" dur="4.579">The problem of unpredictability comes from
yet another angle.</text><text start="1348.179" dur="5.581">For the sake of the argument, let’s assume
that everybody in the Game B society operates</text><text start="1353.76" dur="2.01">according to the rules.</text><text start="1355.77" dur="3.75">Everyone aims to maximize well-being for everybody
else.</text><text start="1359.52" dur="6.529">Still, we can’t predict the ultimate consequences
of our technological innovations.</text><text start="1366.049" dur="5.691">Maybe in the future we will want to combat
diseases using gene drives, and a cure will</text><text start="1371.74" dur="5.66">mix with some virus and will spread rapidly
across the entire population.</text><text start="1377.4" dur="5.43">Maybe we will want to modify crops to fare
well in the hotter climate, but the genes</text><text start="1382.83" dur="5.969">will jump to the weeds that will be extremely
difficult to stop leading to a famine.</text><text start="1388.799" dur="2.361">We can’t predict all accidents.</text><text start="1391.16" dur="2.2">That’s why they happen.</text><text start="1393.36" dur="6.85">That’s why they will continue to happen,
even in the best of imaginable societies.</text><text start="1400.21" dur="6.459">And when this society has access to exponential
technology, accidents can be terminal.</text><text start="1406.669" dur="7.101">We’re not good at risk assessment of second-
and third-order effects over the long term.</text><text start="1413.77" dur="3.75">These effects are indirect effects from the
first-order effects.</text><text start="1417.52" dur="5.83">So it’s hard for us to know whether a technology
will be safe and beneficial over the long</text><text start="1423.35" dur="1.0">run.</text><text start="1424.35" dur="1.9">Our good intentions are not enough.</text><text start="1426.25" dur="7.049">We’re simply not capable of predicting what
the noxious effects of an invention we’ll</text><text start="1433.299" dur="3.071">come across decades into the future.</text><text start="1436.37" dur="3.55">Daniel wants to preserve technological advancements.</text><text start="1439.92" dur="6.749">But how is it possible, when we’re simply
blind to its future impact on us and on the</text><text start="1446.669" dur="1.201">environment?</text><text start="1447.87" dur="2.24">Competition and human nature</text><text start="1450.11" dur="3.65">Access to things and institutions is not enough.</text><text start="1453.76" dur="3.24">People are not equal in terms of ability.</text><text start="1457.0" dur="6.169">Some people necessarily will gain more status
and recognition by virtue of them being better</text><text start="1463.169" dur="1.661">at certain things.</text><text start="1464.83" dur="4.26">Lots of people will contribute nothing that
will be highly valued.</text><text start="1469.09" dur="5.76">Won’t it be a problem for those who would
want to be seen in such a light?</text><text start="1474.85" dur="6.16">If it will be a problem — which is more
than likely — then how will they react?</text><text start="1481.01" dur="6.87">Will they stand by or will they do what we
always do, pillage and conquer?</text><text start="1487.88" dur="3.4">Competition seems to be ingrained into our
minds.</text><text start="1491.28" dur="6.33">We compete for status, power, resources, mates,
and even for our lives.</text><text start="1497.61" dur="5.77">We explain this phenomenon by referring to
evolutionary pressures that molded our minds</text><text start="1503.38" dur="1.6">in such a way.</text><text start="1504.98" dur="6.78">Just as we are afraid of snakes, or crave
salty and fatty foods, we have strong tendencies</text><text start="1511.76" dur="1.39">for competition.</text><text start="1513.15" dur="5.69">We contest to show our value and to secure
access to resources and mates.</text><text start="1518.84" dur="7.42">That’s why we have some complex emotions
and associated concepts for justice and fairness,</text><text start="1526.26" dur="5.86">jealousy, sense of being at a certain level
on the social hierarchy, positive emotions</text><text start="1532.12" dur="6.34">involved in the recognition of winning and
negative emotions involved in defeat.</text><text start="1538.46" dur="7.67">These emotions lead to various problems, and
they may even drive our use of dangerous technology.</text><text start="1546.13" dur="4.86">Daniel argues that we can, in fact, overcome
these impulses.</text><text start="1550.99" dur="6.679">He says that the idea that we’re inherently
competitive is mistaken, because it’s based</text><text start="1557.669" dur="6.111">on looking at competitive cultures and the
other cultures are now long gone.</text><text start="1563.78" dur="6.09">When we look at other primates, we very often
see hierarchies and competition.</text><text start="1569.87" dur="6.73">The most famous example is our closest relative
— chimpanzees, who patrol their territory</text><text start="1576.6" dur="4.949">and violently genocide other bands out of
existence.</text><text start="1581.549" dur="5.521">On the other side of the spectrum are bonobo,
also called pygmy chimpanzees, who seem to</text><text start="1587.07" dur="3.609">be much more egalitarian and non-violent.</text><text start="1590.679" dur="1.031">Which are we?</text><text start="1591.71" dur="3.969">And can our nature be changed and controlled?</text><text start="1595.679" dur="6.691">We’re more sexually dimorphic than bonobo,
which tells us that most likely our species</text><text start="1602.37" dur="7.429">is, in fact, one where males physically compete
between each other, while females may compete</text><text start="1609.799" dur="3.051">between each other in other ways.</text><text start="1612.85" dur="5.43">This is a pattern that’s consistent across
a variety of species.</text><text start="1618.28" dur="6.77">If the drive for competition is as deeply
rooted in our biological endowment as seeking</text><text start="1625.05" dur="6.4">mates, securing shelter, making tools, then
it may be extremely difficult to contain it</text><text start="1631.45" dur="2.21">and maintain long-term stability.</text><text start="1633.66" dur="7.22">So far, Daniel hasn’t made a convincing
argument that this is even possible, an argument</text><text start="1640.88" dur="5.86">that would take into account biology, anthropology,
and our psychology.</text><text start="1646.74" dur="5.059">Daniel said that for the competition to be
present there has to be a single metric on</text><text start="1651.799" dur="5.771">which to measure success or position, but
in the new society there wouldn’t be a single</text><text start="1657.57" dur="5.63">metric, as anyone could do their own thing
and pursue achievements there.</text><text start="1663.2" dur="6.4">But we already live in such a world with a
multitude of metrics or hierarchies.</text><text start="1669.6" dur="5.15">In each sport you have a different metric,
in each branch of science you have a different</text><text start="1674.75" dur="6.66">hierarchy of scholars, each branch of the
industry competes mostly within the branch.</text><text start="1681.41" dur="5.629">Photographers compete with other photographers,
drummers compete with other drummers.</text><text start="1687.039" dur="5.701">We have loads of disciplines with their own
metrics and hierarchies.</text><text start="1692.74" dur="4.29">Competition is going on strong and is fierce
in any of them.</text><text start="1697.03" dur="5.87">So it’s plausible that in the new society
people would also like to compete with the</text><text start="1702.9" dur="6.42">peers that are in the same general domain
or are doing something at least similar.</text><text start="1709.32" dur="3.38">So far, I haven’t seen a counterargument
to that.</text><text start="1712.7" dur="7.94">A related point to that of our drive for competition
and status is Daniel’s comment on the plasticity</text><text start="1720.64" dur="1.64">of our nature.</text><text start="1722.28" dur="3.61">Our species has been selected for memetics.</text><text start="1725.89" dur="5.89">Essential to human nature is the depth of
nurture capacities — we are extremely adaptive</text><text start="1731.78" dur="6.41">beings, we learn to adapt to all our environments
— we learn the language, the tools, how</text><text start="1738.19" dur="3.57">to operate efficiently in an environment.</text><text start="1741.76" dur="5.99">Because of our extended neoteny, we have unparalleled
space for teaching our young.</text><text start="1747.75" dur="5.929">That’s why human nature can be conditioned
for the extremes — from the Jains who don’t</text><text start="1753.679" dur="2.551">hurt insects to child soldiers.</text><text start="1756.23" dur="7.93">Indeed, there are plenty of examples where
people conform to and are shaped by the circumstances.</text><text start="1764.16" dur="4.95">Lots of Germans during World War 2 worked
in concentration camps.</text><text start="1769.11" dur="6.59">Some Buddhist monks devote their entire lives
to meditation and scholarly work, supposedly</text><text start="1775.7" dur="4.229">being able to extend kindness to all living
creatures.</text><text start="1779.929" dur="6.491">Yet, these examples don’t show us those
people who didn’t go along with the rest.</text><text start="1786.42" dur="3.77">How many Germans didn’t take part or ran
away?</text><text start="1790.19" dur="3.03">How many people failed at becoming monks?</text><text start="1793.22" dur="6.56">The problem is, we don’t know whether it’s
possible to nurture all people so that they</text><text start="1799.78" dur="6.92">fit well into a given system, and we don’t
know whether this will be stable for many</text><text start="1806.7" dur="1.02">generations.</text><text start="1807.72" dur="5.91">As Steven Pinker argued in his book The Blank
Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature,</text><text start="1813.63" dur="4.789">we’re endowed with many tendencies, predilections,
and traits.</text><text start="1818.419" dur="6.571">We’re not blank slates that can be simply
painted on by even the best social system.</text><text start="1824.99" dur="5.84">Daniel needs to make a strong argument that
it is possible to have a teaching system that</text><text start="1830.83" dur="5.959">would work for the vast majority of people
and would be stable.</text><text start="1836.789" dur="6.381">And if it wouldn’t work for all people,
then we need to know what to do with the rest.</text><text start="1843.17" dur="4.82">Cherry-picked examples are not replacements
for arguments.</text><text start="1847.99" dur="6.25">Since the early days of psychology we had
ideas about traits and drives that pertain</text><text start="1854.24" dur="5.25">to competitiveness, going back to Freud’s
libido and Jung’s archetypes.</text><text start="1859.49" dur="6.24">But going even further back to ancient traditions
we see people talking about “sinful” nature</text><text start="1865.73" dur="6.83">of people or about yin and yang or about spirits
that make us do bad things.</text><text start="1872.56" dur="4.21">These are all very crude ways of understanding
ourselves.</text><text start="1876.77" dur="7.74">But they were good enough in that they pointed
toward the complex and not very pretty nature</text><text start="1884.51" dur="1.659">of homo sapiens.</text><text start="1886.169" dur="6.971">What every culture recognized is that people
have the capacity to do great harm, to destroy,</text><text start="1893.14" dur="2.05">in short — to do evil.</text><text start="1895.19" dur="7.27">If you want to go against this, well, all
the power to you, but you need to make a very</text><text start="1902.46" dur="7.39">good case that the plasticity of human nature
is more than just wishful thinking or a look</text><text start="1909.85" dur="3.13">at human nature through pink glasses.</text><text start="1912.98" dur="3.18">We all know about group related biases.</text><text start="1916.16" dur="5.84">We tend to favor the group we’re in, and
we tend to be more negative toward those who</text><text start="1922.0" dur="2.22">are not in our group.</text><text start="1924.22" dur="7.26">We might try to think of these biases only
as due to us living in particular types of</text><text start="1931.48" dur="1.0">societies.</text><text start="1932.48" dur="2.37">But there is a second possibility.</text><text start="1934.85" dur="5.8">These tendencies might have evolved, because
they helped our ancestors survive.</text><text start="1940.65" dur="4.49">Our close relatives — chimpanzees — live
in small groups.</text><text start="1945.14" dur="4.26">Males do border patrols of their territory
in small bands.</text><text start="1949.4" dur="4.909">When they catch someone from another group,
they brutally kill them; no mercy.</text><text start="1954.309" dur="5.781">Our close extinct relative — neanderthal
— also aggressed on other groups.</text><text start="1960.09" dur="6.23">We have evidence of neanderthals killing children
and eating out their brains using a rock.</text><text start="1966.32" dur="6.81">It’s not difficult to believe that such
violent tendencies are a part of our strongly</text><text start="1973.13" dur="1.96">competitive nature.</text><text start="1975.09" dur="5.98">What this points to is the idea of evolutionary
adaptations for war.</text><text start="1981.07" dur="5.82">This trend in evolutionary psychology is getting
more and more traction since at least late</text><text start="1986.89" dur="1.84">1980s.</text><text start="1988.73" dur="7.0">If we indeed have adaptations and tendencies
for inter-group conflict and even warfare,</text><text start="1995.73" dur="6.23">then it might be very difficult designing
a social system that would not trip the evolutionary</text><text start="2001.96" dur="4.41">wire that would fire off a large scale aggression.</text><text start="2006.37" dur="5.26">The only point I’m trying to make here is
that we cannot simply brush this off.</text><text start="2011.63" dur="6.22">It has to be explicitly taken into account
in the design of the society, if it is to</text><text start="2017.85" dur="2.8">stand any chance.</text><text start="2020.65" dur="1.86">Interaction with other societies</text><text start="2022.51" dur="6.141">Daniel imagines that one group of people will
jump-start a successful Game B society, which</text><text start="2028.651" dur="3.179">will grow and attract others to join.</text><text start="2031.83" dur="6.71">He thinks that, because this new society will
give away their solutions for free to everybody</text><text start="2038.54" dur="1.79">else, they would be safe.</text><text start="2040.33" dur="4.17">No one would be incentivized to attack them,
the argument goes.</text><text start="2044.5" dur="3.53">But this is based on a premise that is false.</text><text start="2048.03" dur="6.34">The argument is based on the premise that
power struggles, fights, and wars are driven</text><text start="2054.37" dur="1.9">by rational thought.</text><text start="2056.27" dur="6.409">Yes, it would be rational not to attack the
new society to continue to get new innovations</text><text start="2062.679" dur="1.141">from them.</text><text start="2063.82" dur="3.15">But this is not how humans work.</text><text start="2066.97" dur="5.61">Human societies attack others because they’re
scared, they don’t want to lose their position;</text><text start="2072.58" dur="6.36">they want to show others they’re not to
be messed with, and for a myriad of other</text><text start="2078.94" dur="1.81">irrational reasons.</text><text start="2080.75" dur="5.69">Just because it’s in everybody’s interest
not to attack the new society, it doesn’t</text><text start="2086.44" dur="2.669">guarantee that it will not happen!</text><text start="2089.109" dur="5.29">Even today, countries don’t adopt better
solutions from other countries.</text><text start="2094.399" dur="6.861">The most known example is USA not even having
national health care and paid leave/vacation.</text><text start="2101.26" dur="6.27">Another is North Korea who would fare much
better if it adopted the model of South Korea.</text><text start="2107.53" dur="5.78">How can we expect that in the future worse
countries would adopt the way of the better</text><text start="2113.31" dur="1.0">countries?</text><text start="2114.31" dur="5.87">We can expect a growing number of Game B societies,
but most of the world will go on with their</text><text start="2120.18" dur="1.689">business as usual.</text><text start="2121.869" dur="7.231">In the worst case, Game B societies will be
crushed by the more powerful ones.</text><text start="2129.1" dur="1.0">Various</text><text start="2130.1" dur="3.44">The new system will have many inefficiencies.</text><text start="2133.54" dur="1.299">We make errors.</text><text start="2134.839" dur="1.381">Machines break.</text><text start="2136.22" dur="1.6">Pipes burst.</text><text start="2137.82" dur="4.43">Materials spill over and get to underground
rivers.</text><text start="2142.25" dur="2.82">The closed-loop will have leaks.</text><text start="2145.07" dur="3.48">The destruction of the environment will continue.</text><text start="2148.55" dur="5.51">The waste and degradation will be slower of
course, but will stay with us even in the</text><text start="2154.06" dur="1.779">new social order.</text><text start="2155.839" dur="6.351">In a system where everyone would be provided
with food and access to things, even if most</text><text start="2162.19" dur="6.91">people would likely continue to work for satisfaction
and progress, there would be many free riders.</text><text start="2169.1" dur="5.84">They would only consume and use the things,
but not contribute much, if at all.</text><text start="2174.94" dur="5.72">This could generate animosities and conflicts
between the free riders and the producers.</text><text start="2180.66" dur="6.03">It’s just one example, when groups of people
would defect from the system, even though</text><text start="2186.69" dur="2.87">it would lead to them being worse off.</text><text start="2189.56" dur="5.12">This can happen for a variety of reasons,
biological, medical, psychological.</text><text start="2194.68" dur="5.65">And it can happen even in a society with a
stellar education system.</text><text start="2200.33" dur="4.2">So how would the defectors be dealt with by
the society?</text><text start="2204.53" dur="6.33">Will the society be resilient to the presence
of the mistaken defectors?</text><text start="2210.86" dur="5.2">Everyone would get access to things, as they
would get a service to use these things and</text><text start="2216.06" dur="2.67">have them fixed and replaced.</text><text start="2218.73" dur="2.85">That means that people wouldn’t own them.</text><text start="2221.58" dur="3.74">Will people be willing to relinquish private
property?</text><text start="2225.32" dur="6.039">Will people be willing to abandon their sentimental
and unique items?</text><text start="2231.359" dur="5.671">There are plenty of things that just cannot
be mass produced, such as works of art, or</text><text start="2237.03" dur="3.66">things that were used by some important person.</text><text start="2240.69" dur="3.76">These cannot be copied, but they are highly
valued.</text><text start="2244.45" dur="3.78">We want such things today, we will want them
in the future.</text><text start="2248.23" dur="5.37">How can a closed-loop production economic
system accommodate this?</text><text start="2253.6" dur="3.72">There are plenty of hierarchies in our world.</text><text start="2257.32" dur="6.09">Lots of those hierarchies are constructed
by amassing power and access to resources.</text><text start="2263.41" dur="5.4">It’s very likely that we do it to signal
our value to potential mates.</text><text start="2268.81" dur="6.539">The more resources a person has, the more
chances will their offspring have for a biologically</text><text start="2275.349" dur="1.461">successful life.</text><text start="2276.81" dur="6.05">The more resources a person has, the more
likely they have valuable genes.</text><text start="2282.86" dur="6.24">But in the Game B world order there is no
place for such hierarchies, no place for signaling</text><text start="2289.1" dur="3.94">genetic value by conspicuous consumption.</text><text start="2293.04" dur="5.43">This means that romantic and sexual relationships
will also be affected.</text><text start="2298.47" dur="4.369">So how would relationships look like in the
new society?</text><text start="2302.839" dur="5.731">Will the alternative model be accepted by
a sufficiently large number of people?</text><text start="2308.57" dur="2.97">If not, what then?</text><text start="2311.54" dur="1.47">Anti-tech philosophy</text><text start="2313.01" dur="5.57">Daniel takes it as a given that we cannot
stop technological progress, that’s why</text><text start="2318.58" dur="2.73">we have to change our social dynamics.</text><text start="2321.31" dur="3.0">Anti-tech philosophers would disagree.</text><text start="2324.31" dur="6.58">They would say that not only we can stop technology,
but we should do it at all costs.</text><text start="2330.89" dur="5.77">This is especially clear in Kaczynski’s
Anti-Tech Revolution: Why and How.</text><text start="2336.66" dur="2.24">Even the title tells you a lot!</text><text start="2338.9" dur="6.439">Kaczynski lays out his understanding of technology
and argues that we need a radical movement</text><text start="2345.339" dur="5.471">with a singular goal — to destroy global
industrial civilization, as that’s the only</text><text start="2350.81" dur="3.02">way to save complex life on Earth.</text><text start="2353.83" dur="4.759">He presses this point strongly and outlines
how it could be done.</text><text start="2358.589" dur="4.931">It’s not clear why Schmachtenberger thinks
this is impossible.</text><text start="2363.52" dur="3.839">He may have some good reasons, and it would
be great to hear them.</text><text start="2367.359" dur="4.021">But for now, this sentiment seems unjustified.</text><text start="2371.38" dur="5.85">Some anti-tech philosophers, including Kaczynski,
Zerzan, and Ellul believe that technology</text><text start="2377.23" dur="6.75">has very negative impact on us, and this is
intrinsic to technology, as it mechanizes</text><text start="2383.98" dur="5.78">everything converting us to rule-following
parts, who can’t genuinely engage with the</text><text start="2389.76" dur="1.849">world and with our lives.</text><text start="2391.609" dur="5.681">Schmachtenberger would do well to respond
to such critiques of technology to make his</text><text start="2397.29" dur="2.48">case deeper and stronger.</text><text start="2399.77" dur="3.64">And we would see how tight his case is.</text><text start="2403.41" dur="6.63">Countering these anti-tech positions is necessary
to fend off criticisms of his ideas about</text><text start="2410.04" dur="3.16">the technological future of humanity.</text><text start="2413.2" dur="6.29">Some anti-tech thinkers believe that the technology
itself is the source of existential risks</text><text start="2419.49" dur="2.31">and that it should be abandoned.</text><text start="2421.8" dur="6.64">Ted Kaczynski even postulated a plan to establish
an anti-tech movement whose only goal would</text><text start="2428.44" dur="5.63">be to damage the industrial civilization so
that it would be unrecoverable.</text><text start="2434.07" dur="5.42">According to him, this is the only chance
of preserving the continuation of life on</text><text start="2439.49" dur="1.05">Earth.</text><text start="2440.54" dur="6.069">We may now ask Daniel Schmachtenberger, why
is it better to devote our resources to the</text><text start="2446.609" dur="6.751">dangerous plan at rearranging our entire society
rather than go with the recommendations of</text><text start="2453.36" dur="2.58">anti-tech philosophers?</text><text start="2455.94" dur="1.0">Ethics</text><text start="2456.94" dur="5.47">Daniel’s work on starting the trend towards
a new type of society seems to be based on</text><text start="2462.41" dur="1.11">a naïve ethics.</text><text start="2463.52" dur="3.49">By that, I don’t mean that it’s entirely
nonsensical.</text><text start="2467.01" dur="6.92">What I mean is that the ethics that underlies
his enterprise can be characterized by two</text><text start="2473.93" dur="6.46">statements: first, his ethics seems to be
fairly reasonable and possibly acceptable</text><text start="2480.39" dur="6.08">for most people, without many controversial
positions; and second, his ethics wasn’t</text><text start="2486.47" dur="3.649">sufficiently explored or argued for.</text><text start="2490.119" dur="6.301">And this characteristic is shared even by
many anti-tech philosophers, climate activists,</text><text start="2496.42" dur="2.36">environmentalists, etc.</text><text start="2498.78" dur="6.45">This is clearly seen, when Daniel says that
because technology poses an existential risk,</text><text start="2505.23" dur="4.73">we have to do something about, we have to
solve the problem.</text><text start="2509.96" dur="4.49">On the face of it, it looks like an uncontroversial
statement.</text><text start="2514.45" dur="5.47">But it’s also somewhat naïve, because we
never hear Daniel say why should we solve</text><text start="2519.92" dur="1.19">this problem.</text><text start="2521.11" dur="6.249">If technology indeed poses a grave risk, and
someday it’ll lead to the disappearance</text><text start="2527.359" dur="2.691">of our species, what then?</text><text start="2530.05" dur="1.89">Who will cry after us?</text><text start="2531.94" dur="3.06">Will the trees be negatively affected by that?</text><text start="2535.0" dur="1.75">Will the bees be worse off?</text><text start="2536.75" dur="2.7">Will the animals in the wild miss us?</text><text start="2539.45" dur="1.0">No.</text><text start="2540.45" dur="5.72">There will not be a single individual feeling
a loss after homo sapiens is gone.</text><text start="2546.17" dur="3.47">So why would our extinction be bad?</text><text start="2549.64" dur="2.36">For whom it would be bad?</text><text start="2552.0" dur="5.39">Antinatalist philosophers make a case that
leads us to a conclusion that the disappearance</text><text start="2557.39" dur="2.81">of humanity wouldn’t be bad after all!</text><text start="2560.2" dur="3.08">Some even say it would be a good thing!</text><text start="2563.28" dur="6.79">The fundamental philosophical question that
all Game B thinkers, including Daniel Schmachtenberger,</text><text start="2570.07" dur="6.539">but also anti-tech philosophers, environmentalists,
and climate activists have to engage with</text><text start="2576.609" dur="6.671">and provide an answer to is this: why prolong
the existence of homo sapiens?</text><text start="2583.28" dur="7.58">Wouldn’t it be just fine if we simply went
extinct just a bit sooner rather than later?</text><text start="2590.86" dur="1.0">Conclusion</text><text start="2591.86" dur="5.2">Daniel Schmachtenberger identified a fundamental
problem with our civilization — rivalrous</text><text start="2597.06" dur="6.24">groups armed with exponentially progressing
technology strive to benefit themselves at</text><text start="2603.3" dur="4.85">the expense of others, which should lead to
the collapse of civilization.</text><text start="2608.15" dur="1.0">The solution?</text><text start="2609.15" dur="6.969">Reshape the social reality to bind well-being
of people so that a success of anyone benefits</text><text start="2616.119" dur="1.301">everyone.</text><text start="2617.42" dur="6.05">There are numerous problems with this version
of Game B. People defect from systems for</text><text start="2623.47" dur="4.48">irrational reasons, even when playing with
the rules would benefit them.</text><text start="2627.95" dur="7.629">The progress of technology and society cannot
be predicted, and hence it cannot be controlled.</text><text start="2635.579" dur="7.021">We seem to have a natural instinct for competition,
we see it everywhere — in politics, in sports,</text><text start="2642.6" dur="2.37">in arts, in cuisine.</text><text start="2644.97" dur="6.97">We have no reason to believe that it’s possible
to get rid of it to form a new type of a society.</text><text start="2651.94" dur="5.649">Various thinkers point to technology itself
as the source of the problems, not just how</text><text start="2657.589" dur="1.131">we use it.</text><text start="2658.72" dur="6.8">And finally, the apocalyptic predictions are
such only because of unstated assumption that</text><text start="2665.52" dur="4.36">it would somehow be bad for homo sapiens to
go extinct.</text><text start="2669.88" dur="4.109">An assumption that, upon closer inspection,
is naïve and unjustified.</text></transcript>
