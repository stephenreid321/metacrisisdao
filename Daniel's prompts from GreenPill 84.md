Three suggestions made by Daniel in [[MetacrisisDAO with Daniel Schmachtenberger – Green Pill 84]]:

## Red teaming web3

Thinking about the entire field of web3 technologies, it would be good to make a short taxonomy of what that means- what are all the types of technologies and primary applications that are being thought of.

In that space, what are all of the possible negative externalities, both physically and psychosocial that this space could either accelerate or exacerbate or novelly create?

I would like to see some just deep workshopping on that, where you just red team the fuck out of the idea of the positiveness of crypto.

Let’s say we make uncorruptable ledgers for the provenance of information and science or whatever, so that people aren’t going to be messing with the data and so we can do better open data open science stuff.

That seems really good - where is that not good? Well, let’s say we have a situation like we happen to have in the world today, where you’ve got people doing viral hunting and gain of function research on pathogens, to make way more pathological pathogens.

Hopefully that’s done in the name of how to develop anticipatory responses, vaccines, medicines, whatever it is – but say they then publish those gene sequences on an uncorruptable ledger.

Before cheap gene sequencers that might have been a good idea, but in the context of cheap gene sequencers we might need to be able to get those pathogenic gene sequences offline.

## ‘Vertical topic areas’

The next step I would really like to see people engaging in and generating ideas on is both by vertical topic area- say planetary boundaries, exponential tech, existential risk- or you can make it much narrower and just say dealing with weaponized drones, dealing with grid fragility, dealing with fragility of the amazon coral etc…

For each of those types of issues, does web3 tech by itself or in conjunction with other technologies, laws and projects enable solutions that are not currently existent?

I’d like to see web3 folks engaging with topic matter experts in major global risk areas and global problem areas like the SDGs, and ask, what are the hardest problems that you can’t fix? What makes these problems wicked?

To really try to see if there anything about the affordances of this technology that could help solve those problems– that would be just amazing to populate and to taxonomize, and that’s the ‘vertical division’.

## ‘Horizontal topic areas’

The deeper horizontal divisions are things like the generator functions- how could we address perverse incentives writ large? Or across contexts, how could we address commoning writ large? How could we address internalizing externalities in the decision-making processes writ large? How could we address turning trade-offs into synergistic satisfiers?

Start to think through what are the solutions there, and then again red team.
