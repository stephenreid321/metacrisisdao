The metacrisis is the underlying crisis driving a multitude of crises, not just ecological collapse.

The underlying game theoretic attractors that create the metacrisis are:

1. **Catastrophies** - Uncoordinated human action leading to externalization of harm. See [this article](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) for a full understanding of coordination failures/catastrophies
2. **Dystopias** - We can use governance systems to solve for coordination failure, but how do we prevent those from becoming totally authoritarian? See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs) for a full understanding of dystopias.
3. We are searching a for *third attractor* that creates coordination but without creating dystopia.
