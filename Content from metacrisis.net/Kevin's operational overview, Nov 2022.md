This project will have two phases: divergence and convergence. Right now we are diverging.

We will build the intelligence for this project at metacrisis.net. For each thread that Daniel gives us, we will write a page on metacrisis.net on that subject.

How to follow a thread from Daniel:

1.  Do a podcast on it, and then transcribe the podcast into this wiki.
2.  Ask a researcher to ingest a topic/article into the wiki.
3.  Post a prompt in the telegram groupÂ [https://t.me/+gyNXeGLnh71kYmMx](https://t.me/+gyNXeGLnh71kYmMx), and get everyones take, then ingest that information into the wiki.

We will meet weekly to quarterback the project (ask Kevin Owocki for an invite), but eventually the plan is to decentralize this resource such that anyone can contribute permissionlessly.
