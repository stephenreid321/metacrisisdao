## Why?
"A Problem Well Stated is Half Solved" ~ Charles Kettering.

The goal of this resource is to well-state the problem of the meta-crisis in an open, accessible, easy-to-understand, and up-to-date resource.

## How?
Write, publish, and maintain an updateable, web-based risk report that provides a high-level overview of the metacrisis and what the needs of global coordination are.

This resource will go into detail of the various verticals of crisis (E.g. catastrophic risk, planetary boundaries, exponential tech, war and conflict, and failure of human systems: electrical grid, financial systems, food and water security, supply chains, etc).

## Goals
Our goals for this project are (tentatively):

* To boil down long/primary research on x-risk into TLDR/meta.
* Record an encyclopedia of solutions, of which web3 is one of them.
* Primary research task: map out web3 tech.
* Build a bridge from web3 contributors into this research.
* (one day) Build an incubator of solutions that address them.
